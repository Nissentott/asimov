nearby islands were also
killed off. Now we have the
expression “dead as a
dodo.”

It is hard to believe,
nowadays, that such an un-
usual and interesting form

of life should have been
slaughtered so casually,
with no attempt made to
save a few, but it has hap-
pened over and over again.
It is one of the brighter as-
pects of recent history that
human bei are now des-

 

 

 

perately try to save vari-

 

ous endangered species
though considering the in-
exorable increase in the
number of human beings
and the space they must oc-
cupy, this is often a losing

Plant Sexuality

Before modern times,
plants were usually

thought to be not truly
alive in the sense that ani-
mals were. In the biblical
story of creation, plants
grow as soon as dry land ap-
pears. They seem to be part
of the land and meant only
for food. In contrast, on the

fifth and sixth days, God is
described as specifically
creating animal life and in-
structing it to multiply.
(Even today, vegetarians
announce that their love of
living things keeps them
from eating animal food, al-
though the plant life they
eat is every bit as alive.)
Some of this disdain
for plant life was broken

down, in 1682, by the En-
glish botanist Nehemiah
Grew (1641-1712), who
showed that plants repro-
duced sexually, that they
had sexual organs, and that
individual grains of pollen
were the equivalent of the
sperm cells of the animal'’s
world.
