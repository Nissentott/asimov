so that there would be no
interference fringes when it
rejoined. Furthermore, if
the source traveled at the
speed of light, then the dis-
tance from the source to
any other point in the direc-
tion of travel would be
zero, because a speed faster
than light was impossible.
FitzGerald derived a
simple equation, involving
the ratio of the speed of the
light source to the speed of
light, that would reduce dis-
tances in the direction of
travel just enough to pro-
duce a negative result in
the Michelson-Morley ex-
periment. This was called
the FitzGerald contraction,
but it seemed ad hoc (that
is, an explanation made up
just to account for a partic-

ular observation and noth-
ing else). It would take
thirteen more years for a
more fundamental solution
to be found.

 

Dewar Flask

Heat can be transported
from one place to another
in three ways: by conduc-
tion (travel through mat-
ter), convection (carriage
by the movement of matter
itself, as by air and water
currents), and radiation.

Of these, only radiation
can transport heat in a vac-
uum. Realizing this, Dewar
(see 1889) in 1892 con-
structed a double-walled
flask with a vacuum be-
tween the walls. He was in-
terested in low-

temperature work, and
very cold liquids such as
liquid nitrogen, if kept in
such a double-walled flask,
would gain heat from the
outside only slowly. Dewar
cut down on transport by
radiation even more by cov-
ering the interior of the dou-
ble walls with a mirror
surface so that radiation
would be reflected rather
than absorbed.

These were called
Dewar flasks and proved in-
dispensable to low-temper-
ature work. They also
entered the commercial
home market, where they
sold as thermos bottles for
keeping cold drinks cold
and hot drinks hot.

Psychoanalysis

Breuer had started to use
hypnotism in the treatment
of mental diseases such as
hysteria (see 1880). The
method had later been
taken up by Freud (see

1884), but he eventually
abandoned hypnotism for
free association, allowing
the patient to talk ran-
domly and at will with a
minimum of guidance. In
this fashion, the patient
was gradually put off

guard, and matters came to
be revealed that in ordi-
nary circumstances would
have been kept secret from
the patientâ€™s conscious
mind

method over hypnotism
