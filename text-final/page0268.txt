modern times, the absolute
jungle of different measure-
ments was a serious handi-
cap to progress and
prosperity. Yet tradition
made it almost impossible
for any region to give up its
time-sanctified system for
others merely because the
others made more sense
and were easier to use.

The French, however,
in the grip of their Revolu-
tion, thought it a suitable
time to develop a system of
sensible measurements,
and they appointed a com-
mission to work on it, a
commission including such
men as Laplace (see 1783),
Lagrange (see 1788), and
Lavoisier (see 1769).

The commission tried

 

to base the system on natu-
ral measurements, so that
the basic unit of length, for
instance, the meter (from a
Greek word meaning “to
measure”’), was to be equal
in length to 1/10,000,000 of
the distance from the North
Pole to the Equator. Other
units were worked out to in-
terconnect with the meter,
when that was possible,
while larger and smaller
units were worked out by
multiplying or dividing by
ten.

This so-called metric
svstent was by far the most
useful and logical system of
measurement ever dreamed
up, and all that stood in the
way of its instant adeption
was, first, the dead weight

of tradition, and second,
the hostility of the rest of
Europe to the French Revo-
lutionaries. Even so, it grad-
ually spread, and today the
metric system is used uni-
versally, except in the
United States. And even in
the United States, the met-
ric system is used by scien-
tists, and increasingly by
others.

The metric system rep-
resented an improvement
in technique, and like other
such techniques (writing,
the alphabet, Arabic numer-
als, printing, chemical no-
menclature), it may not
have advanced scientific
knowledge in itself, but it
made such advances easier.

Titanium

The English minister Wil-
liam Gregor (1761-1817)
grew interested in mineral-
ogy. More out of curiosity
than anything else, he took
to analyzing as many odd

minerals as he could find.
In 1791 he isolated a sub-
stance from one of these
minerals that he felt might
be a new element. It was,
and four years later it was
named titanium by Klap-
roth (see 1784).

Columbia River

The American navigator
Robert Gray (1755-1806),
between 1787 and 1790,
was the first American to
circumnavigate the world,
doing so during a voyage to
