Saturn’s Rings

By this time it seemed very
likely that Saturn's rings
were composed of myriads
of small particles. Since

they were inside Roche's
limit (see 1849), solid parti-
cles would break up under
tidal influences and be un-
able to coalesce again. In
1857 Maxwell (see 1855)

showed that this was in-
deed so, based on purely
theoretical considerations,
and no one has doubted it
since.

Evolution by
Natural
Selection

The British biologist
Charles Robert Darwin
(1809-1882), like many bi-
ologists, believed that life
forms had evolved; that
some species, with time,
changed into other related
species, while some species
became extinct. What puz-
zled Darwin was the mecha-
nism that drove evolution
onward.

In 1838 he read Mal-

thus (see 1798) and realized
that not only human beings
multiplied past the food
supply available, but that
all living things did. There-
fore, in each generation,
there was a competition for
survival among the too-
many, and those tended to
survive who could snatch
enough food, or best evade
a predator. In short, nature
itself would select a few
from the many for survival.
The characteristics that
made survival likely would
be inherited by the off-
spring of the survivers and

again there would be a nat-
ural selection. Darwin as-
sumed that there were
always variations among
offspring, random and tiny
variations perhaps, and
that nature then used those
variations as a means of se-
lection, so to speak. The
“better” among the varia-
tions would not always do
better, since there was al-
ways the factor of chance,
but on the whole, and in
the long run, they would.
Darwin was theorizing,
then, on evolution by natu-
ral selection. Knowing that
