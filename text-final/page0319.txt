and each fatty acid had a
long chain of (usually) six-
teen or eighteen carbon
atoms. Chevreul was the
first to isolate the most
common of these fatty
acids: stearic acid, palmitic
acid, and oleic acid.

In 1825 he and Gay-
Lussac (see 1804, Scientific
Ballooning) patented can-
dles made out of these fatty
acids. Such candles were
harder than tallow candles,
gave a brighter light,
looked better, needed less

care while burning, and
didn’t smell as bad. To the
society of the time, this was
a major advance.

Astigmatism

Spectacles for the far-
sighted were some five cen-
turies old, and for the near-
sighted, almost as old (see
1249 and 1451). It is possi-
ble to have difficulty
seeing, however, even if one
is neither, if the cornea of
the eye is not perfectly

curved. Such a condition is
known as astigmatism
(from Greek words mean-
ing “no spot,” because a
small spot cannot be see
sharply by astimatics) and
can be combined with ei-
ther near- or far-sight-
edness.

The British astronomer
George Biddell Airy (1801
1892) suffered from astig-
matism, and he was the
first, in 1825, to design eye-
glass lenses to correct that
condition.

Non-Euclidean
Geometry

Euclid had based his mas-

| sive structure of geometry,
over two thousand years be-
fore, on ten axioms and
propositions that could be
considered so self-evident
that they required no proof.

(One had to start some-
where.)

One of these axioms
can be stated in a number
of ways, of which the sim-
plest is “Through a given
point, not on a given line,
one and only one line can
be drawn parallel to the
given line.”

This did not seem quite

 

as self-evident as Euclid’s
other axioms, and the no-
tion of parallelism implied
the existence of lines of in-
finite length—not an easy
thing to accept

Since Euclid’s time,
mathematicians had des-
perately tried to prove that
axiom from the other
axioms. All failed to do so
