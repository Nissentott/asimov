Technetium

By now, only four gaps re-
mained in the periodic
table of elements between
number 1 (hydrogen) and
number 92 (uranium). They
were numbers 43, 61, 85,
and 87. Noddack and his
colleagues, who had discov-
ered rhenium (see 1925),

thought they had also dis-
covered number 43, but it
turned out they were mis-
taken.

The Ltalian physicist
Emilio Gino Segré (1905—-
1989) tackled the problem
in a different way. Thinking
the chances small that he
could find the element in
the Earth's crust, he won-

dered if he might not manu-
facture it. After all, Fermi
had been bombarding ele-
ments with neutrons to pro-
duce elements higher by
one atomic number (see
1934). If Segré bombarded
molybdenum (element 42),
might he not then manufac-
ture detectable quantities
of element 43?
