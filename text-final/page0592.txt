its own huge gravity.

Zwicky (see above) sug-
gested that in the case of su-
pernovas, collapse might be
extreme. After expending
its energy, a supernova
might collapse under its
own gravitational pull till
its subatomic particles (pro-
tons and electrons) were
crushed together to form
neutrons and the neutrons
were forced into contact.

Such a neutron star
might possess all the mass
of a full-sized star and yet
be only 8 miles across. Nat-
urally, a neutron star
would be difficult to detect,
and it was not until thirty-
five years after Zwicky's
suggestion that the detec-
tion was accomplished.

Sex Hormones

Butenandt had isolated the
male sex hormone andros-
terone and worked out its
structure (see 1931). In
1934 the Croatian-born
Swiss chemist Leopold Ste-
phan Ruzicka (1887—-1976)
synthesized androsterone
and showed that Buten-
andt’s analysis was correct.
For this he shared the
Nobel Prize for chemistry
in 1939 with Butenandt.
Meanwhile, also in
1934, Butenandt isolated
progesterone, a female sex

hormone of vital impor-
tance to the chemical mech-
anisms involved in
pregnancy. Butenandt, like
Domagk (see 1932, Pron-
tosil), could not accept the
Nobel Prize because of Hit-
ler’s ruling. It was not until
1949 that he could accept it
formally.

Bathyspheres

Since earliest time, people
had dived beneath the
ocean surface, either for
pleasure or to gather such
objects as sponges and
pearl oysters. Naturally
they could not go very deep
or stay very long.

Later they could stay
underwater for extended
periods in caissons or div-
ing suits, but only at the
cost of having the air they
breathed compressed to the
pressure of the surrounding
water. This limited the
depth to which they could
penetrate and the time they
could remain.

At high pressures, ni-
trogen dissolves in the
blood and bubbles out
when the pressure is re-
lieved, causing the bends,
or caisson disease, which re-
sults in agonizing pain and
sometimes paralysis and
death. To prevent this, pres-
sure has to be released very
slowly, a procedure first

suggested in 1878 by the
French physiologist Paul
Bert (1833—1886).

To achieve real depth
for indefinite periods, it
was clearly necessary to
provide a sealed gondola ca-
pable of maintaining an in-
terior at ordinary
pressures, as Piccard had
done for high-altitude bal-
loons (see 1931). The task
was more difficult at sea,
for in the heights the differ-
ence between inside and
outside pressure was less
than one atmosphere, while
in the depths the sea
pressed in with many atmo-
spheres of pressure.

The American natural-
ist Charles William Beebe
(1877—-1962) devised the
necessary steel vessel. It
had thick quartz windows
and was a sphere (at the
suggestion of President
Roosevelt) rather than a
cylinder for greater
strength.

In 1934 Beebe used this
bathysphere (Greek for
"“sphere of the deep”) to de-
scend to a record depth of
3,028 feet, nearly three-
fifths of a mile. It was terri-
bly risky, for he had to be
suspended from a ship, and
if the lifeline had snapped,
no rescue was possible.
However, no untoward inci-
dents took place during his
explorations.
