The sending of signals by
radio waves reached a cli-
max on December 12, 1901.
Marconi (see 1895) broad-
cast radio waves from the
southeastern tip of En-
gland, using balloons to lift
his antenna as high as possi-
ble. The signals were re-
ceived in Newfoundland.
This day is usually consid-
ered the one on which radio
was invented, and Marconi
is given credit as the inven-
tor.

Europium

Eleven rare earth elements
were now known, but that
did not exhaust the list.

The French chemist Eu-
géne-Anatole Demarcay
(1852—1903) detected a
twelfth, which he named eu-
ropium in honor of Europe.

Grignard
Reagents

The French chemist Victor
Grignard (1871-1935) was
searching for methods of at-
taching carbon-containing
groups to organic mole-
cules. He needed a catalyst,
Zinc shavings and magne-
sium shavings did some
good but not much.
Frankland (see 1852) had re-
ported on zinc combina-
tions with organic
compounds using diethyl

ether as the solvent. Grig-
nard tried it with magne-
sium instead, in 1901, and
found he had the catalyst
he needed.
Magnesium-organic
compounds dissolved in di-
ethyl ether are called Grig-
nard reagents and proved
extraordinarily useful to or-
ganic chemists who were
trying to build up relatively
complicated compounds.
For this work, Grignard
shared with Sabatier (see
1897) the Nobel Prize in
chemistry in 1912.
