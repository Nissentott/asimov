calculated.

In 1962 the American
astronomers Roland L. Car-
penter and Richard M.
Goldstein were able to
show that Venus had the as-
tonishingly slow period of
about 250 days. (The figure
was later refined to 243.09
days.) What's more, Venus
rotated in retrograde fash-
ion, from east to west
rather than from west to
east as Earth and other bod-
ies in the Solar System do.
The reason why this is so is
still not clear.

Noble Gas
Compounds

Since the inert gases—he-
lium, neon, argon, krypton,
xenon, and radon—had
been discovered, over half a
century before, they had ap-
peared to be truly inert,
since their atoms would
form bonds with no other
atoms. This made increas-
ing sense when their elec-
tronic structure was
worked out, since in all
cases their outermost elec-
tron shell was full so that
they had no tendency to
gain, lose, or share elec-
trons.

This tendency was not
absolute, however. Linus
Pauling (see 1931) had
pointed out that the inert
gas atoms grew less inert as

their atomic number in-
creased, so that those with
higher atomic numbers
might be induced to form a
bond with fluorine, which
was the most active of all el-
ements and the most apt to
snatch an electron from un-
likely places.

In 1962 the British-
born Canadian chemist
Neil Bartlett (b. 1932)
found that a compound,
platinum fluoride, was al-
most as active as fluorine it-
self and easier to work
with. He immersed it in
xenon gas and the two sub-
stances combined to form
xenon fluoroplatinate. This
was the first known case of
an inert gas atom forming a
bond with any other atom
or group of atoms.

Thereafter, other com-
pounds involving fluorine
or oxygen were formed, not
only with xenon but with
radon and krypton. The
smaller inert gas molecules
—argon, neon, and helium
—remained inert, however.

As a result, chemists no
longer liked to use the term
inert gases, preferring noble
gases as less likely to sig-
nify absolute inertness.
Compounds such as xenon
fluoroplatinate are there-
fore now referred to as
noble gas compounds.

Approaching
Absolute Zero

After Giauque had intro-
duced his technique for
attaining very low tempera-
tures (see 1925), tempera-
tures as low as 1/50,000 of a
degree above absolute zero
had been reached. That was
not yet the ultimate, of
course. Absolute zero can
never be truly attained but
it can be approached ever
more closely as new tech-
niques are developed.

In 1962 the German-
born British physicist
Heinz London (1907—-1970)
used a mixture of the two
helium isotopes helium-4
and helium-3 for the pur-
pose. Ordinarily they mix
perfectly, but at tempera-
tures below 0.8°, they sepa-
rate. Processes that allowed
the two isotopes to mix and
then separate repeatedly of-
fered a powerful new way
of cooling. Thanks to this
and to other techniques in-
volving helium-3 and nu-
clear magnetic properties,
temperatures of 1/1,000,000
of a degree above absolute
zero have been attained.
