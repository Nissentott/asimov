southerly is still about 650
miles north. It is safe to
say, then, that no human
being, primitive or civi-
lized, had ever crossed the
Antarctic Circle prior to
1773

In that year, Captain
Cook, on his second voyage
through the Pacific in
search of an important land
area, ventured far to the
south and on January 17 (at
the height of the Antarctic
summer) crossed the Ant-
arctic Circle, a true first for
humanity.

Bacilli

Bacteria had just barely
been made out by Leecuwen-
hoek nearly a century be-
fore (see 1683). Since then,
microscopists had not been
able to do more than just
barely see them. In 1773,
however, a Danish biolo-
gist, Otto Friedrich Muller
(1730-1784), managed to
make them out well enough
to divide them into catego-
ries. Some looked like little
rods and he called them ba-
cilli (from a Latin word for

“little rod"); some were
curved into spiral shapes
and he called them spirilla.

He was the first to clas-
sify microorganisms gener-
ally into genera and species
after the fashion of Lin-
naeus (see 1735), but even
he couldn’t do very much
with the tiny specks that
were bacteria.

Oxygen

Priestley worked with mer-
cury in his collection of
gases (see 1770) and could
not help using it more di-
rectly in his experiments.
Mercury, when heated in
air, will form a brick-red
compound, which we now
call mercuric oxide. Priest-

ley heated some of this com-
pound in a test-tube by
using a lens to concentrate
sunlight upon it. When he
did this, the compound
broke up, liberating mer-
cury, which appeared as
shining globules in the
upper portion of the test-
tube.

In addition, a gas was

given off that possessed
most unusual properties.
Combustibles burned more
brilliantly and rapidly in it
than they did in ordinary
air. Mice placed in an atmo-
sphere of this gas were par-
ticularly frisky, and
Priestley himself felt
and easy'’ when he
breathed it.
