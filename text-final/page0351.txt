1845

 

Astraea

Since the four asteroids
Ceres, Pallas, Juno, and
Vesta had been discovered
(see 1801 and 1802). No oth-
ers had been found since,
and it was widely assumed
that four were all that ex-
isted.

The German amateur
astronomer Karl Ludwig
Hencke (1793—1866) began
a systematic search in
1830, however, and after
fifteen years of failure, he
discovered a fifth asteroid
in 1845. He named it As-
traea after the Greek god-
dess of justice. Then, in
1847, he discovered a sixth,
which he named Hebe, after
the Greek goddess of youth.

Hencke’s discoveries
galvanized astronomers,
who began to search for as-
teroids as a century earlier
they had searched for com-
ets.

Spiral Nebulas

The nebulas that had been
seen in the sky until now

had seemed to be no more
than little cloudy patches.
Telescopes weren't good
enough to make out much
in the way of structure—or
perhaps structure was sim-
ply lacking in them.

In 1827, however, an
Irish astronomer, William
Parsons, Earl of Rosse
(1800-1867), began work
on the largest telescope yet
planned, and by 1845 it was
finished. It had a mirror
that was 72 inches across.
However, the telescope,
though large, was clumsy.
It couldn’t see much of the
sky even when the sky was
clear—and it was hardly
ever clear.

Nevertheless, the tele-
scope did accomplish a few
things. In 1845 Rosse noted
that one nebula had a dis-
tinct spiral shape, and in
the following years he
found fourteen others that
were also spiral in appear-
ance. These were termed
spiral nebulas, and the time
was to come, eighty years
later, when they achieved
considerable importance.

Permanent
Gases

In 1845 Faraday returned
to the task of liquefying
gases (see 1823). He made
use of a mixture of solid car-
bon dioxide and ether as a
cooling agent, and he used
higher pressures than he
had in his earlier experi-
ments.

Working in this way,
Faraday managed to lig-
uefy many gases. Indeed,
there were only six gases
known in 1845 that Fara-
day could not liquefy de-
spite all his efforts. They
were hydrogen, oxygen, ni-
trogen, carbon monoxide,
nitric oxide, and methane.

These nonliquefiable
gases were called, at least
for a time, permanent gases,
and they represented chal-
lenges that chemists tack-
led grimly.
