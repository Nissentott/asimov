decade, they were being
used in transatlantic ca-

Balloon

o
Angioplasty
Coronary atherosclerosis
could now be treated by
performing bypass opera-

tions (see 1969). An alterna-
tive, nonsurgical technique
was developed in 1977.
This called for tiny bal-
loons being led into the af-
fected arteries by means of
catheters. The balloons
then expanded and pressed
back the plaques, widening
the bore of the arteries.
Such balloon angioplasty

slowly became more popu-
lar as an alternative to by-
pass operations.

 

1978

 

Radar Mapping
of Venus

The United States launched
Pioneer Venus on May 20,
1978, and it went into orbit
about Venus on December
4, 1978. It sent several
probes into Venus's atmo-
sphere and found that the
cloud layer contained drop-
lets of sulfuric acid, that
about 2.5 percent of the sun-
light striking the cloud
layer penetrated to the sur-
face of the planet, and that
the atmosphere was 96.6
percent carbon dioxide and
3.2 percent nitrogen. In
view of its density, that
meant Venus's atmosphere
had more than three times

as much nitrogen as
Earthâ€™s.

Venus Pioneer also
beamed radar waves at
Venus, and from the reflec-
tions, details of the surface
(otherwise invisible from
outside the cloud layer)
could be determined.

The surface of Venus
does not appear to be bro-
ken into plates as Earth's is
and is mostly of the type
we associate with conti-
nents. It seems to have a
huge supercontinent that
covers about five-sixths of
the total surface, with the
remaining sixth a lowland
that may once have con-
tained water.

In the north is a large
plateau named Ishtar Terra,

about as large as the
United States. On the east-
ern portion of the plateau is
a mountain range. There is
another and even larger pla-
teau in the equatorial re-
gion called Aphrodite Terra.
It too has mountains.

There are also canyons
and what may be extinet
volcanoes.

Charon

On June 22, 1978, the Amer-
ican astronomer James W.
Christy, examining photo-
graphs of Pluto, noted a dis-
tinct lump on one side. He
checked other photographs
and found that the lump
shifted position. Finally he
decided it was a satellite lo-
