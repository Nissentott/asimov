the charge by accidentally
discharging it into his own
body. He said he wouldn’t
take another such shock to
be the king of France and
worked with the device no
longer.

Because Musschen-
broek popularized the de-
vice and because he worked
at the University of Leyden
in the Netherlands, the elec-
tricity-storing device came
to be called a Leyden jar. It
was at once made use of by
other experimenters.

Blood and Iron

Chemists had little or no
idea of the composition of
living tissue—even what el-

ements it contained, since
so little was known about
the elements.

Of course, iron was
known, and an Italian phy-
sician, Vincenzo Menghini
(1704-1759), fed iron prepa-
rations to dogs in 1745 in
order to see what would
happen to the iron and
whether any of it would be
incorporated in the tissues.
To make sure that no iron
was present in dogs that
didn’t eat the iron prepara-
tion, he obtained blood
from normal dogs and
burned it, expecting to find
no iron in the ash. How-
ever, he did find iron, to his
surprise. What's more, he
was able to ascertain that

the iron was present, spe-
cifically, in the red blood
corpuscles.

This represented the
first discovery in living tis-
sue of a trace element; that
is, one present in only
small quantities but never-
theless essential to life
(though the fact that iron
was essential to life was not
yet understood).

Scurvy

Ever since Vasco da
Gama's voyage (see 1497),
scurvy had been an increas-

ing menace. More men
were disabled by scurvy on
long voyages than by any
other cause. This was par-
ticularly serious in Great

Britain, which depended on
its navy for protection and
on its merchant ships for
its prosperity.
