 

The Late 19th Century (1851—-1894)

Two figures dominate late-
nineteenth-century science
—Charles Darwin and
Louis Pasteur. One ex-
plained how life on Earth
had evolved, while the
other changed humanity’s
future with discoveries that
led to the ability to control
diseases. While other scien-
tists had speculated on the
possibility that contempo-
rary life forms had evolved
from earlier ones, Darwin
was the first to lay out in de-
tail the theory of evolution
by natural selection. The
book that brought his work
to the world’s attention,
The Origin of Species (1859),
was the most important sci-
entific work since Newton's
Principia. Although at the
time there was no fossil

data to provide details on
the evolution of the human
species, in 1871 Darwin
published The Descent of
Man, an application of his
theories to the human race.
In 1856 Louis Pasteur dis-
covered that gentle heating
kept wine from going sour
and prevented the contami-
nation of milk, and in the
process he became inter-
ested in microorganisms. In
1860 he showed the role
they played in the decay of
meat. His great contribu-
tion came in 1862 when he
published evidence for the
germ theory of disease.
This was the beginning of
modern medicine, for now

 

 

specific and effective steps
could be taken toward pre-
ventions and cures of dis-

eases. Perhaps the greatest
contribution to chemistry
during this period was
made by Dmitry Ivanovich
Mendeleyev, who in 1869
created a table of the ele-
ments arranged in order of
increasing atomic weight.
Electricity also featured
strongly in late-nineteenth-
century technological inno-
vations. Chief among those
who put electricity to work
for the masses was Thomas
Alva Edison. In 1879, two
years after devising the pho-
nograph and after thou-
sands of failed attempts, he

 
   

 

passed a current through a
filament in a glass bulb and
allowed humanity to push
back the dark. A decade
later and shortly aft
ge Eastman had deve
