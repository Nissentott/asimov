Jupiter

Other than the Sun and the
Moon, the planets known to
the ancients were seen
merely as points of light
When Galileo turned his
telescope on them, how-
ever, he found that they ex-
panded into little orbs.
Clearly, they were extended
bodies but were tov small,
or too distant, or both, to
show as orbs to the unaided
eve. (The stars, however,
remained points of light
even when viewed by
telescope.)

Jupiter was not only an
orb but, in January 1610,
Galileo observed four dim-
mer objects in its immedi-
ale vicinity. As he watched
from night to night, he saw
that they were circling Jupi-
ter, as the Moon circles the
Earth. They were, in short,
four moons of Jupiter
Kepler (see 1609) later re-
ferred to them as satellites,
a Latin word referring to
those who remain close to

 

someone rich or powerful
in the hope of picking up
scraps and favors

Jupiter’s four satellites
were the first objects ever
seen in the sky that clearly
circled some object other
than Earth, which was a
strong point against Ptol
emy’s geocentrism. For that
reason, the discovery dis-
pleased the rigidly reli-
gious. Some refused to |
through the telescope in

 

order to avoid seeing the
satellites. One pointed out
that since the satellites
were not mentioned by Aris-
totle, they clearly did not
exist

Seeking support from

the Medici family, who in
1609 had become grand

the satellites “'the

name didn’t stick. The Ger
