cated some 12,500 miles
from Pluto. (At Pluto’s dis-
tance, this is not much of a
separation as seen from
Earth, which accounts for
the long-delayed discov-
ery.)

Christy named the sat-
ellite Charon, after the fer-
ryman who took shades
across the River Styx to
Hades in Greek mythology

Charon circles Pluto in
6.39 days, which is just the
time it takes for Pluto to
turn on its axis. The two
bodies, Plute and Charon,
have slowed each other’s ro-
tational speed through
tidal action until each per-
petually presents one side
to the other. They now re-
volve about a common cen-
ter of gravity like two
unequal parts of a dumb-
bell held together by a grav-
itational pull. (This is the
only dumbbell-situation in
the Universe that we have
been able to observe so
far.)

From the distance of
separation and the time of
revolution, it is possible to
work out the total mass of
the two bodies, which
comes to about one-eighth
the mass of the moon. Pluto
is about 1,850 miles in di-

ameter (far smaller than
anyone had thought), and
Charon is about 750 miles
in diameter. Charon has 10
percent the mass of Pluto,
so that the two are the near-
est thing to a double planet
we know. (The Earth-Moon
is second in this respect,
but the Moon has only 2
percent the mass of the
Earth.)

Oncogenes

In 1978 the American scien-
tist Robert A. Weinberg
and his colleagues succ
fully produced tumors in
mice by the transfer of indi-
vidual genes. The genes con-
cerned were called
oncogenes, the prefix being
the one commonly used in
medical terminology for
“tumor.”

The oncogene was
found to be very similar to
a normal gene. The two
might differ, in fact, in a
single amino acid along the
chain. The picture therefore
arises of a normal gene (a
protooncogene), which is
replicated with every cell
division and, through some
accidental change during
one of the replications, be-

 

 

COIMEs an oncogene.

Virus Genome

Once the nature of

 

>nes

had been determined (see
1944 and 1954), it became a
dream of molecular biolo-
gists to work out the struc-

ture of all the genes of an
organism (the genome).

In 1978 the first step
was taken in this direction
when the genome of a virus
called SV40 was deter-
mined. Of course, viruses
are the simplest living or-
ganisms and have the
smallest genomes, but this
points the way, ultimately,
to the working out of the
human genome.

Test-Tube Baby

On July 25, 1978, a normal
baby was born in Great
Britain of an egg that had
been fertilized by a sperm
in the glassware of a labora-
tory rather than within the
mother's body. Such a test-
tube baby offers a way for
couples to have children
when, for one reason or an-
other, fertilization within
the body cannot take place.
