Empires

Conflict of some sort is as
old as life. With human be-
ings, conflict reached new
pitches of danger, thanks to
intelligence. Human beings
can remember past wrongs,
brood upon them, and plot
revenge. They can also,
after victory, realize that
the defeated parties may
plot revenge, and therefore
take further action to wipe
them out completely.
What's more, the advance
of technology put weapons
in human hands that made
conflict ever bloodier.
Sumeria was not as for-
tunately placed as Egypt
was. The Tigris and Eu-
phrates did not offer quite
the same gentle watery
highway that the Nile did.
Communications were not
as effective and there
seemed less community of
interests among the people
of the region. The Sumer-
ian city-states, with their
wheeled carts and bronze
weapons, fought each other
more assiduously than the
Egyptian city-states did.
What's more, whereas
Egypt was protected on
both sides of the Nile by de-

sert, Sumeria was more
open to invasion. The result
was that non-Sumerian
people settled on the upper
reaches of the Tigris and
Euphrates.

Just to the north of
Sumeria, where the Eu-
phrates and Tigris come
closest together, cities were
founded by Akkadians, who
spoke a non-Sumerian lan-
guage. The Akkadian lan-
guage was of a type that
came to be called Semitic.
(The most important Se-
mitic language extant
today is Arabic.) The Sum-
erian language was not Se-
mitic and, in fact, is not
related to any other lan-
guage we know of. There
was even less community of
interest between the Sum-
erian city-states and their
Akkadian neighbors than
between the Sumerian city-
states themselves.

Thus it came about
that, even seven centuries
after Egypt had formed a
nation, the city-states of the
Tigris and Euphrates were
unable to unite in peace. It
was clear that the region
would prosper best under
unified rule, but there was
no agreement as to which

city and which ruler should
take over the leadership,
and the matter had to be
settled by force.

About 2350 B.c., a man
named Sargon (ca. 2334â€”
2279 B.c.) took over the rule
of Agade, one of the Akkad-
ian cities. He was success-
ful in war and established
his rule over all of both
Akkad and Sumeria. He
also sent his armies north-
ward and eastward and es-
tablished his control over
the upper reaches of the
Tigris-Euphrates valley, a
region that eventually
came to be known as As-
syria, and over the territory
to the east of the Tigris,
which was known as Elam.

While the Egyptian uni-
fication involved city-states
of similar language and cul-
ture, Sargon ruled over peo-
ples with different
languages and cultures, his
Akkadians being dominant
over the others.

If one cultural group
dominates others politi-
cally and militarily, the re-
sult is commonly referred
to as an empire. Sargon es-
tablished the first empire
we know of. It was not, of
course, the last.
