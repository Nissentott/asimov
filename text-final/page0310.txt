acids, too, but glycine was
the first amino acid clearly
associated with substances
that later came to be called
protein.

Antarctic Land

After Captain Cook's cross-
ing of the Antarectic Circle
(see 1773), much of the ex-
ploration of Antarctic wa-
ters was conducted by
sealers and whalers, as a
by-product of their search
for seal fur and whale blub-
ber and oil (whale oil being
a major source of illumina-
tion in the lamps of Europe
and America).

On November 16, 1820,
an American sealer, Na-
thaniel Brown Palmer

(1790-1877), sighted land
south of Tierra del Fuego.
Also in that year, and per-
haps several months ear-
lier, a British naval
commander, Edward
Bransfield (ca. 1795-1852),
sighted land in the same
general area. At the time
there was no way of know-
ing what the nature of the
land was, but we now know
that it is a long, curved pen-
insula that we call the Ant-
arctica peninsula. It is the
only part of the Antarctic
landmass that sticks up
well north of the Antarctic
Circle.

Also in 1820, a Russian
explorer, Fabian Gottlieb
von Bellingshausen (1778â€”
1852), discovered a small is-
land, which he named Peter

I Island, about 150 miles

south of the Antarctic Circle.

We might list Palmer,
Bransfield, and Bellings-
hausen as joint discoverers
of Antarctic land.

Diffraction
Gratings

Since Newton's experi-
ments with light (see 1666),
scientists had used glass
prisms to produce light
spectra. In 1820 Fraunhofer
(see 1814) was the first to
find a substitute in a diffrac-
tion grating (closely spaced
thin wires). Such gratings,
the equivalent of fine, paral-
lel scratches on glass, even-
tually replaced the prism in
the study of spectra.
