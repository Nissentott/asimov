spite all those stars, the
two plates would be identi-
cal if the spots of light were
stars, and only stars. If the
two plates were projected
on a screen in rapid alterna-
tion, none of the stars
would seem to move. If one
of the “‘stars” was really a
planet, however, one that
had moved against the
starry background during
the interval between photo-
graphs, as the plates were
alternately thrown upon
the screen, that one object
would seem to dart back
and forth,

On February 18, 1930,
Tombaugh found such a
flicker in the constellation
Gemini. From the
smallness of the shift, the
object had to be moving
very slowly and must there-
fore lie beyond Neptune.
On March 13, 1930, the
seventy-fifth anniversary of
Lowell’s birth, the discov-
ery was announced. The
new planet was named
Pluto, first because that god
of the nether darkness was
appropriate to a planet
swinging farthest out from
the light of the Sun, and sec-
ond because the first two
letters were the initials of
Percival Lowell.

In time, though, Pluto
turned out to be a small
planet incapable of influ-
encing Uranus’s orbit mea-
surably. The possibility of

another large planet be-
yond Neptune therefore re-
mains to this day.

Surface
Temperature of
the Moon

Nicholson, who discovered
Jupiter IX (see 1914), also
developed sensitive heat-
measuring devices that
could determine the surface
temperature of an astro-
nomical body such as the
Moon from the amount of
heat it delivered to the in-
strument. By using it he
could show that the surface
temperature of the Moon
dropped nearly 200° C dur-
ing the period of its eclipse
by the Earth'’s shadow. The
Moon had no ocean or at-
mosphere to conserve and
circulate heat, and its solid
body was so poor a heat-
conductor that the surface
lost a great deal of heat be-
fore any new supply could
work its way upward from
the deeper layers.

In 1930 Nicholson and
Edison Pettit obtained the
first reasonably accurate
measurement of the tem-
perature of the lunar sur-
face. As corrected by work
since, it seems that the sun-
lit side of the Moon reaches
a maximum temperature of
117° C, which is well above
the boiling point of water.
The night side of the Moon,

after two weeks without
sun, sinks to a temperature,
just before dawn, of —169°
C, far colder than Antarc-
tica at its coldest.

Since the Moon is at
Earth’s average distance
from the Sun, we see how
fortunate it is that Earth
has a faster spin and
shorter day, an ocean to
conserve heat, and an atmo-
sphere to distribute it.

Coronagraph

For two centuries, astrono-
mers had been traveling
the world in order to wit-
ness rare astronomical
events that were not easily
visible in other places and
at other times. Examples
are the far southern stars,
total eclipses of the Sun,
and transits of Venus and
of Mercury.

One of the rare sights,
from the point of view of
both beauty and scientific
interest, was the Sun's
pearly upper atmosphere,
or corona, in which helium
was first discovered (see
1868).

In 1930 the French
astronomer Bernard-
Ferdinand Lyot (1897—
1952) devised the corona-
graph, a telescope that fo-
cused the light of the Sun
on an opaque disk, cutting
out all scattered light from
the atmosphere and from
the lens itself. Mounting a
