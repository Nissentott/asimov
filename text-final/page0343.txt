that the laws of thermody-
namics, which had been de-
veloped from the study of
heat engines, might hold
for chemical reactions too.
In short, the laws of thermo-
dynamics might be univer-
sal.

Hess's law founded the
science of thermochemi
(the interrelationship of
heat and chemical reac-
tions).

Ozone

In 1840 a German chemist,
Christian Friedrich Schon-
bein (1799-1868), working
in a poorly ventilated labo
ratory, became conscious of
a peculiar odor in the neigh-
borhood of electrical equip-
ment. He tracked it down
and located a gas, which he
named ozone, from the
Greek word for “smell.” It

 

was later identihed by an
Irish physical chemist,
Thomas Andrews (1813
1885), as a form of oxygen

 

 

Hypnotism

Mesmerism had been de-
bunked (see 1774), but
there were still those who
practiced it as a form of
show business. A British
physician, James Braid
(1795-1860), having wit-
nessed an exhibition of
mesmerism in 1841,
investigated the matter and

decided the phenomenon
was real.

A person could indeed
be put into a trancelike
state resembling sleep by
having the conscious mind
forced into a state of weari-
ness through repetitive
stimuli. During such a state
of quasi-sleep, the patient
was extraordinarily open to

suggestion and was rela-

 

tively unresponsive to pain.
Braid, avoiding the older
name, called the phenome-
non hypnotism, from the
Greek word for "“sleep.”

It turned out to have

 

 

its uses in medicine.
