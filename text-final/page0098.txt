referred to as the False
Geber. This is a pity, for the
False Geber was the first to
describe sulfuric acid, the
most important single in-
dustrial chemical used
today (barring such
“always-known" sub-
stances as air, water, and
salt).

Sulfuric acid is much
stronger than acetic acid
and made possible many
chemical changes that
would not have been possi-
ble before.

Distilled Liquor

Natural fermentation has
its limits. As fruit or other
materials ferment, alcohol
accumulates and eventu-

1304

ally grows sufficiently con-
centrated to kill the yeasts
or other microorganisms
that were producing the fer-
mentation.

The alchemists had
learned how to distill: how
to heat a substance and
drive off the volatile materi-
als, which could condense
into liquid elsewhere, leav-
ing behind dissolved mat-
ter, Thus, if sea water 1s
heated, the vapors consist
only of water, and if cooled,
this is drinkable. The salt is
left behind and has its own
uses.

Eventually, alcoholic
beverages were distilled.
Since alcohol boils at a
lower temperature than
water does, the initial va-

pors of the beverage are
higher in alcohol than the
original liquid. If the va-
pors are then cooled and
condensed, the result is a
stronger liquor with a good
deal more of a “kick” than
the original has.

In 1300 the Spanish al-
chemist Arnau de Villanova
(ca. 1235-1312) distilled
wine and obtained reason-
ably pure alcohol for the
first time. In the process, of
course, he prepared
brandy, which is distilled
wine with a much higher al-
cohol content than ordi-
nary wine. Not only
brandy, but whiskey (made
by distilling fermenting
grain) became available in
sizable quantities.

 

Giotto’s Comet

A bright comet was visible
in Europe’s sky in 1301. It

 

created the usual panicky
stir, but the Italian artist
Giotto di Bondone (ca.
1267-1337), usually
known by his first name,

observed it with an artist's
eye.

Till then, and for a con-
siderable time afterward,
those who drew comets let
their panic be their guide
and presented the silliest
pictures imaginable. In
1304, however, Giotto

painted The Adoration of
the Magi, in which he pic-
tured the star of Bethlehem
as a comet, and seems to
have let the comet of 1301
guide his brush. Giotto’s is
the first realistic depiction
of a comet.
