Southern Stars

Throughout history, from
the Sumerians onward, de-
tailed astronomical obser-
vation has been confined to
the northern hemisphere.
The north celestial pole is
high in the sky as seen from
Europe and the Middle
East, and the stars near it,
in their daily circle about
it, never dip below the hori-
zon.

On the other hand, the
south celestial pole, along
with the stars near it, are
never above the horizon as
seen from Europe.

As a result, the south-
ernmost sky remained un-
known to European
astronomers till the Age of
Exploration began. During
Magellan's voyage, when
they were off the shores of
southern South America,
the sailors saw two hazy
clouds that looked like de-
tached portions of the

 

Milky Way. They are called
the Magellanic Clouds to
. A bright star con-
figuration, the Southern
Cross, was also reported.
No systematic astro-
nomical observations of the
far southern skies were
made, however, until the
English astronomer Ed-
mond Halley (1656—1742)
traveled to the island of St.
Helena in the south Atlan-
tic Ocean. There he spent
two years, and despite bad
weather that severely lim-
ited astronomical observa-
tions, he returned in 1678
to publish a catalog of 341
southern stars that astrono-
mers had, until then,
known nothing about.

Light Waves

The particle-versus-waves
controversy grew sharper
Newton (see 1666) felt
that light consisted of parti-
ause there

 

 

cles, partly bec

was a vacuum between
Earth and Sun and he
didn’t see how a wave
could cross a gap where
there was nothing to wave.

Huygens (see 1656), on
the other hand, insisted
that light consisted of
waves of the same type as
sound (so-called longitudi-
nal waves, which wave in
and out in the same direc-
tion the waves are travel-
ing). As to what was
waving, Huygens supposed
that there was a very subtle
fluid in the vacuum of
space (this came to be re-
ferred to by Aristotle’s term
aether), which could not be
detected in any ordinary
way.

Neither Newton's parti-
cles nor Huygen's longitudi-
nal waves could explain
Bartholin’s observation of
double refraction nine
years before, but that was
ignored. The controversy
continued to rage.
