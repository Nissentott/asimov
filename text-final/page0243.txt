What was more, at the end
of that time, a mouse could
be put into that volume of
air and live—and a candle
would burn.

Whatever it was about
air that supported combus-
tion and animal life, and

bon dioxide by burning can-
dles and breathing animals,

was restored by plant life.
This was the first indica-
tion that plants and ani-
mals formed a chemical
balance that kept Earth’s
atmosphere breathable.

Combustion

Chemists’ understanding of
combustion at this time
was based on a theory first
propounded in 1700 by a
German chemist, George
Ernst Stahl (1660—1734).
He suggested that objects
that were combustible were
rich in something he called
phlogiston, from a Greek
word meaning “to set on
fire.”

In the process of com-
bustion, fuel lost its phlogis-
ton, and eventually a
residue was left that lacked
phlogiston and would not
burn. Stahl recognized that
rusting was comparable to
combustion. He believed
metals to be rich in phlogis-
ton and held that they grad-

ually lost it as they were
converted to rust.

The chief flaw in the
theory was that when wood
burned it lost much of its
weight (presumably be-
cause of the loss of phlogis-
ton), yet when iron rusted,
it gained weight. In Stahl’s
time, however, it wasn’t
considered important to
measure quantities exactly
and chemists ignored this
paradox.

Lavoisier (see 1769),
however, believed in
weighing. In 1772 he began
heating objects in enclosed
volumes and weighing that
volume. For instance, he
burned certain elements in
air and found that the mate-
rial produced was heavier
than the elements them-

 

 

selves, though nothing
within the container had
changed weight at all. If
the elements gained weight
in burning, then something
else must have lost weight,
and the only something else
this could be was the en-
closed air. If some of the air
had been absorbed by the
burning elements, there
should be a partial vacuum
in the flask. Lavoisier
opened the flask, and sure
enough, air rushed in. The
added weight of the in-
rushing air was equal to

the weight gained by the el-
ement that had been
burned.

By such experiments,
Lavoisier concluded that
combustion did not come
about through the loss of
