atomic weight. That led to
important advances in the
next decade.

Gyroscope

Just as a pendulum has the
ability to swing in an un-
changing plane, so does a
massive sphere in rotation
have a tendency to main-
tain the direction of its axis
of spin (as the Earth itself
does). Foucault, who had
made an amazing demon-
stration with a pendulum
(see 1851), now demon-
strated the matter of the ro-
tating sphere, by setting a
wheel with a heavy rim (a
gyroscope) into rapid rota-
tion. It not only maintained
its axial direction, but
when it was tipped, the ef-
fect of gravity was to set up
a motion at right angles
that was equivalent to the
precession of the equinoxes
(see 134 B.C.).

This meant that a gyro-
scope, maintaining its axial
orientation, could be used
as a steady indicator of true
north, substituting for, and
better than, the magnetic
compass that had been in
use for some six centuries.

Sunspots and
Earth

The British physicist Ed-
ward Sabine (1788â€”1883)
showed, in 1852, that the
frequency of disturbances
in Earth's magnetic field
paralleled the increase and
decrease of sunspots on the
Sun. This was the first ex-
ample of a linkage between
Earth and Sun involving
something other than the
Sun's radiation of light and
heat or its gravitational
pull. It was also the first
hint that sunspots had mag-
netic properties.

Elevators

As cities grow more
crowded, they may spread
out in area, or divide the
available room into smaller
and smaller living quarters,
or build higher and higher
structures

High structures were
originally built of stone, as
the strongest available ma-
terial, but the higher the
building, the thicker the
stone had to be at the bot-
tom to support the struc-

 

ture and the less room
available for living quar-
ters. Reinforced concrete
(see 1849) made higher
structures possible, and
steel beams would in time
be even better.

Yet with the best mate-
rials and the cleverest de-
signs, a tall building is
useless if there is no way
but slow elimbing to lift
oneself to the top floors.

In 1852 an American in-
ventor, Elisha Graves Otis
(1811-1861), built the first
mechanical elevator with
an adequate safety guard,
one that would keep it from
falling even if the cable
holding it were severed
completely. In 1854 Otis
demonstrated the workabil-
ity of the device by having
himself raised to a consider-
able height and then hav-
ing the cable cut. He
descended safely.

It was the elevator
more than anything else
that made possible the
shape of cities to come.
