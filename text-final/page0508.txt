manner by any gas came to
be called neon lights.

The fact that tubes
filled with neon or other
gases could be twisted into
any shape—so that they
spelled out words, for in-
stance—made it inevitable
that they would replace or-
dinary incandescent bulbs
in advertising signs.

Sex-Linked
Characteristics

In 1910 Morgan, still work-
ing with fruit flies (see
1907), noted a white-eyed
male fly among a mass of
ordinary red-eyed ones. It
was a mutation such as De
Vries had observed among
plants (see 1900).

Morgan crossed the
white-eyed male with a
red-eyed female, and all the
offspring were red-eyed

(red was dominant). In the
next generation, however,
there were both red-eyed
and white-eyed flies, and
all the white-eyed ones
were males.

This was the first obser-
vation of sex-linked charac-
teristics. It meant that
males and females had to
be differentiated in chromo-
some makeup. The way
they are is that not all the
chromosomes make up per-
fect pairs. In the case of one
of them, the female fruit fly
did indeed have a pair (an
X chromosome and an X
chromosome), but the male
had one normal chromeo-
some and a stub (an X
chromosome and a Y
chromosome). A white-eye
gene on the female X chro-
mosome could be overbal-
anced by a red-eye gene on
the pair, but a white-eye
gene on the male X chromo-

 

some had nothing to bal-
ance it on the Y-
chromosome stub.

The chromosome pairs
of male and female human
beings show a similar dif-
ferentiation.

Mathematics
and Logic

Russell (see 1902) and the
British mathematician Al-
fred North Whitehead
(1861—1947) collaborated
on a monumental three-
volume work, Principia
Mathematica, the first vol-
ume of which appeared in
1910. It was another effort
to establish mathematics as
a branch of logic, building
all of it out of basic defini-
tions and processes. It was
the most nearly definitive
complishment of this
ort.
