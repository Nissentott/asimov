of change and noting how
much had been accom-
plished at that slow rate,
one could get a notion of
how long the change as a
whole had taken. This be-
lief is called uniformitarian-
ism (change at a uniform
rate over the eons), and it
was opposed to the opinion

that the Earth had been af-
fected by sudden catastro-
phes such as Noah's Flood
(catastrophism) in which
huge changes could take
place in comparatively lit-
tle time.

Hutton published his
observations and conclu-
sions in Theory of the Earth,

which was published in
1785. He did not attempt to
estimate the age of the
Earth, but he made it clear
that the Earth had to be ex-
tremely old, and that there
was no trace of when its be-
ginning might have been
from what he could ob-
serve.

Mountain-
Climbing
Mountains are impressive,
and because they reach to-
ward the sky and their tops
are not attainable by
human beings without a
great deal of trouble, they
were often assumed to be
the abode of gods. The con-
nection of Mt. Olympus
with the Greek gods and of
Mt. Sinai with the God of
the Bible are examples.
Generally, human be-

 

ings admired mountains
but avoided them. If it was
absolutely necessary to get
to the other side, they
searched for comparatively
accessible “passes.” Some
climbing had been done for
scientific purposes, how-
ever. Thus, the Swiss natu-
ralist Conrad Gesner
(1516~1565) had climbed
mountain peaks in the Alps
to search out alpine species
of plants.

By the 1700s, however,
scientists had grown in-
creasingly interested in

mountains—in the plants
and animals living there, in
the nature of the rocks, and
in the glaciers that frosted
their peaks. The Alps were
the mountains most avail-
able to west-European sci-
entists, and their highest
peak is Mount Blanc
(French for “white,” be-
cause its peak is white with
snow and ice at all times).
It is 15,700 feet high. No
one had climbed it, of
course, and it was univer-
sally regarded as the act of
a lunatic to try.
