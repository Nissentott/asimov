Zoos

From the beginning of
genus Homo, hominids and
modern human beings had
been hunting animals for
food. No thought was given
to conserving the animals.
Either people took it for
granted that every species
of animal would always
exist, or they gave it no
thought at all. The Assyrian
monarchs were great hunt-
ers themselves (for sport,
rather than for food), and
Assyrian art is full of repre-
sentations of the kings slay-
ing lions and other
animals.

Nevertheless, there was
also sometimes the impulse

to conserve. If an animal
was rare, there might be a
certain prestige in keeping
it for one's pleasure, as one
might keep a rare work of
art. An early example of
this could be found on the
palace grounds of the Assyr-
ian king Sennacherib (see
above), where there was a
zoo and also a botanical
garden,

Sundials

The original sundial was a
stick pounded into the
ground so that its shadow
might be studied (see 4000
B.C.). Such a stick was
called a gnomon (a Greek
word meaning “indicator”)

since it gave a rough indica-
tion of the time.

Eventually people
learned how to prepare a
circular bowl with the
hours marked off on the
rim and with a gnomon in
the center that was tilted
due north. The shadow
then stayed the same
length as it traveled from
west to east around the rim
of the bowl. This greatly in-
creased the convenience
and use of sundials.

Sundials of this sort ap-
peared in Egypt at least as
early as 700 B.c. (We still
find them in modern gar-
dens, by the way, not to tell
the hours but as orna-
ments.)

Libraries
Books, whether clay bricks
covered with cuneiform or
papyrus covered with hiero-
glyphics and rolled up (the
word volume is from the
Latin word for “to roll up")
were hard to come by in an-
cient times. To get an addi-
tional copy of a book, it had
to be copied over, stroke by

stroke, by a meticulous and
thoroughly literate scribe.
Such copying took a long
time and was hard work, so
that books were both rare
and expensive.

Only a few people
could own books, and a li-
brary (from a Latin word
for “book"’) consisting of
several books must have
been the mark of a rich

man or the painfully accu-
mulated store of a scholar.
Only monarchs with the re-
sources of kingdoms behind
them could accumulate
large libraries in the mod-
ern sense.

The first such monarch
that we know of was Ashur-
banipal (see 2500 B.c.). He
arranged to have every
book in his kingdom copied
