Martin Fleischmann (b.
1927) that they had devised
a method of achieving
nuclear fusion at room
temperature caused under-
standable excitement, for it
promised a revolution in en-
ergy production. News
media around the world
carried reports of the sup-
posed breakthrough.

The “cold fusion” appa-
ratus was simple. A jar held
a palladium cathode sur-
rounded by a solution con-
taining deuterium, a heavy
isotope of hydrogen. The
chemists claimed that
when an electric current
was passed through the so-
lution, the deuterium nu-
clei were condensed so
tightly within the crystal-
line structure of the palla-
dium that they fused,
generating energy in the
form of heat. Unfortu-
nately, when other scien-

tists tried to duplicate the
experiment, they were un-
able to confirm the cold fu-
sion findings. They also
reported inconsistencies in
the Pons-Fleischmann data

lished scientific route for in-

troducing discoveries and
breakthroughs. Instead of
submitting their work to a
peer-review process—dis-
cussion at conferences, the
scrutiny involved in publi-
cation in scientific journals
—they held a press confer-
ence. Moreover, the infor-
mation they provided
lacked significant details of
their experiments.

Within weeks of the
original announcement,
headlines discrediting cold
fusion replaced the earlier
euphoric discussions. After
continuing controversy, a
U.S. Department of Energy

panel found a lack of “con-

vincing evidence to associ-

ate the reported anomalous
heat with a nuclear pro-

cess

Chiron

Kowall called Chiro
teroid when he first de-
tected it (see 1977), but,
beginning in 1987, astrono-
mers noted that its bright-

 

ness was increasing as it
neared the Sun, a phenome-
non associated with com-
ets, not asteroids

In 1989 astronomers re-
ported viewing Chiron's
coma, the enveloping cloud
of luminous gases that form
part of a comet’s head
Chiron is a very large
comet, with a nucleus
about 112 miles in diame-
ter, more than ten times
the size of Halley's comet.
