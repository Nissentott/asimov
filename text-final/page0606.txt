Coelacanth

Finding a new kind of fossil
is exciting enough, but
finding a living specimen of
a species thought to exist

only as a fossil is far more
exciting.

On December 25, 1938,
a trawler fishing off South
Africa brought up an odd
fish about 5 feet long. The
oddest thing about it was
that its fins were attached
to fleshy lobes rather than
directly to the body.

A South African zoolo-
gist, J. L. B. Smith, who
had the chance of examin-
ing it, recognized it as a
coelacanth, a primitive fish
that zoologists thought had

been extinct for seventy
million yearsâ€”to have van-
ished from the Earth while
dinosaurs still existed.

Eventually, other speci-
mens of the fish were ob-
tained as well. What is
most interesting about this
(from our own viewpoint) is
that the coelacanth is a
close relative of the kind of
fish that, hundreds of mil-
lions of years ago, clam-
bered onto land, became
amphibious, and thus be-
came our ancestors.
