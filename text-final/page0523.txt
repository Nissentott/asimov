ranged the elements in
order of increasing atomic
weight but had to place
some slightly out of order
to keep them in their
proper families. Moseley
showed that if the elements
were arranged in order of
increasing nuclear charge,
no element would have to
be placed out of order.

The amount of positive
charge on the nucleus was
called the atomic number. It
was 1 for hydrogen, the
smallest atom, and 92 for
uranium, the most complex
atom then known. For the
first time, chemists could
now be sure how many new
elements remained to be
discovered, and where in
the periodic table they
would fall.

At the time Moseley ad-
vanced his atomic number
suggestion, only seven num-
bers between 1 and 92 re-
mained unrepresented by
elements. They were num-
bers 43,61, 72, 75, 85, 87,
and 91.

Moseley would un-
doubtedly have earned a
Nobel Prize for physics for
this work, but he died in ac-
tion a year later in World
War L.

X-Ray
Wavelength

Laueâ€™s discovery of X-ray
diffraction by crystals (see
1912) led almost at once to
efforts to determine the
wavelengths of X rays by
this method.

This was accomplished
by a father-and-son team of
British physicists. William
Henry Bragg (1862-1942)
and William Lawrence
Bragg (1890-1971). They
worked out the mathemati-
cal details involved in the
diffraction and showed how
to calculate wavelengths
from it.

As a result, the two
Braggs were awarded the
Nobel Prize for physies in
1915.

lons and
Crystals

Thirty years earlier Arrhe-
nius had advanced the no-
tion that electrolytes in so-
lution dissociated into ions
(see 1884). The idea was
that a substance such as so-
dium chloride existed in
solid form as a molecule,
symbolized as NaCl, but on
solution split up into the
positively charged sodium
ion (Na*) and the nega-
tively charged chloride ion
(cl).

When the Braggs were

studying X-ray diffraction,
however (see above), they
found that that phenome-
non could best be under-
stood if it was supposed
that in a solid crystal of so-
dium chloride there were
no intact molecules, merely
sodium ions and chloride
ions positioned with geo-
metric regularity.

Sodium chloride and
many other compounds did
not exist as molecules in
the older sense, then, but as
arrays of ions held together
by electromagnetic interac-
tion.

Beta-Particle
Energies

If a particular atom broke
down to emit an alpha or
beta particle, it would seem
that a definite energy
source had been broached,
and particles of definite en-
ergies ought to be given off.

As early as 1904, W. H.
Bragg (see above), studying
radium, had shown that
alpha particles were emit-
ted with several different
sharply delineated ranges.
Presumably there were sev-
eral different processes
going on within the radium
nucleus, and each gave off
alpha particles of a particu-
lar energy.

In 1914, however, the
English physicist James
Chadwick (1891-1974)
