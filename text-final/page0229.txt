Galaxy

Do the stars in the sk
spread out evenly and in-
definitely in all directions
or are they contained in a
finite volume with a partic-
ular shape. To the eye it
might seem that the first al-
ternative is correct—except
for the Milky Way. Once
Galileo showed that the
Milky Way consisted of

v many, very dim stars
(see 1609), it became clear
that there are far more
stars in the direction of the
Milky Way than in other di-
rections. In 1750, an En-

glish astro! er, Thomas
Wright (1711-1786), main-
tained that the stars
formed a flattened finite
system, but his writings

re so mystical that it
was hard to take him seri-
ously.

In 1755, however, the
German philosopher Im-
manuel Kant (1724—1804)
made a similar suggestion.
He said the Sun was one of
a large number of stars that
existed in a lens-shaped
conglomerate, and that the

<y Way was the result of

ng into the sky along
of the lens.

 

This conglomerate came to
be called the Galaxy, from a
Greek word for the Milky
Way. Kant also suggested
that certain nebulas

he called them in a dr.
matic phrase, “island uni-
verses."'

In this, Kant was quite
correct, but it was to be
over half a century before

y demon-
strated and over a century
and a half before the exis-

f other gal
could be demonstrated
