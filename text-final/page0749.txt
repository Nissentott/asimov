for Edwin Powell Hubble
(see 1923, Cepheids in
Andromeda, and 1929,
Receding Galaxies), who
discovered some of the phe-
nomena it was designed to
explore, the boxecar-size un-
manned observatory was,
at 12 tons, the largest satel-
lite ever launched.

Earth's atmosphere
blurs the visible light that
comes from bodies in
space, and it blocks ultravi-
olet and infrared light rays,
forms of radiation given off
by many astronomical ob-
jects, Because of its orbit,
HST would make clearer
images in visible light and
record images in parts of
the spectrum not visible
from Earth. The resolution
of HST's images was to be
ten times sharper than that
of any Earth-based tele-
scopes, and its probing
power promised views
deeper into space than ever
before possible.

HST was to measure
the size and thus the age of
the universe, to record dis-

 

 

  

tant objects that now can
be seen only faintly, and to
register the ultraviolet spec-
tra of distant and ancient
quasars. It would probe for
the possibility of a black
hole at the « of the
Milky W
about the birth of stars
and search for planets
s similar to our

    
 

 

 

around s
Sun.

All of this was not to be
—at least not for a while—
for HST's primary mirror
had a crucial flaw, called a
spherical aberration, that
damaged its ability to re-
turn clear images in visible
light. In addition, the tele-
scope wiggled when it trav-
eled in and out of sunlight,
blurring 15 to 20 percent of
its images. This meant that
HST was able to carry out
only about half its intended
missions. Nevertheless,
within its first two years of
operation HST sent back
amounts of nl‘c\‘inu:ly

 

 

 

larg
unattainable information.
It relayed images of a ring
of glowing gas around a re-

  

cently explodec
in the Large M
Cloud (see 198

 

upermnova

  

gellanic
). HST's

image of a part of the I

 

 

 

llanic Cloud was

 

nearly six times better than

 

images from the
ground, and images of dis-
tant Pluto and Charon were

completely resolved. Tt

  

made color images of Sat

 

urn nearly as good as those

 

    

 

taken by Voyager when it
I the pl:
tected a hug
storm that
named the Great White
Spot.
Surprising photo-

graphs of two galaxies

 

1et, and de-
Saturnian

isironomers

 

showed thousands of young
blue stars arranged in
ular clusters. At the center
of a galaxy led M51,
HST discovered a dark X
that may be two disks of
dust spinning around a
black hole

Adjustments were
planned to restore HST to
fuller capacity.
