The United States had
a population of 5.3 million
now, half that of Great Brit-
ain. Russia was the most
populous European power
with 33 million, but India

1802

had 131 million and China
295 million. London was
the largest European city
with 864,000, but there
were a number of cities in
the Far East that had over

a million in population.
Canton, with 1.5 million,
was the world’s largest
city.

 

Asteroids

Olbers and his group of Ger-
man scientists were shaken
in their plan to search for a
planet with an orbit be-
tween those of Mars and Ju-
piter by Piazzi's discovery
of Ceres (see 1801). Ceres
was so small, however, that
it scarcely seemed to be a
planet. Olbers’s group de-
cided to continue the
search.

In 1802 they discovered
another planet between
Mars and Jupiter, and they
named it Pallas, one of the
names of the goddess
Athena. In 1804 they found
still another, and in 1807, a
fourth. These were named
Vesta and Juno, after two of

the sisters of Jupiter (Zeus).
The three new planetary
bodies, however, were even
smaller than Ceres.

Herschel (see 1781) sug-
gested they be called aster-
oids (Greek for “starlike”),
because in the telescope
they seemed mere dots of
light, like stars (because of
their small size) rather
than orbs, like the larger
planets.

Eventually it was real-
ized that there were a vast
number of such bodies, per-
haps as many as a hundred
thousand of them, between
the orbits of Mars and Jupi-
ter. This region came to be
called the asteroid belt.
Ceres was the largest of the
asteroids (hence the first

discovered), containing
about a tenth the mass of
all the other asteroids put
together.

Tantalum

In 1802 a Swedish chemist,
Anders Gustav Ekeberg
(1767—-1813), began the
analysis of minerals from
Finland and located a new
metal, which he named zan-
talum in honor of Tantalus
(who in the Greek myths
was tortured by being
placed in water up to his
chin, which he was never
able to drink, whence the
word tantalize). Presum-
ably, Ekeberg found isolat-
ing the element a
tantalizing task.
