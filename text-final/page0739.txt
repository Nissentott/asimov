1983

 

W Particles

The electroweak theory (see
1968) made it seem neces-
sary for the weak interac-
tion to involve three
exchange particles, one pos-
itive (W+), one negative
(W), and one neutral (Z°).
They were massive parti-
cles, at least eighty times as
massive as protons, which
accounted for their being so
elusive. It took a great deal
of energy to form them.

By 1983, however,
physicists had sufficient en-
ergy at their disposal to be
able to detect all three par-
ticles. They did so and
found that the particles had
the predicted mass, too.
That nailed the electroweak
theory into place.

The experiments were
planned and carried
through by the Italian phys-
icist Carlo Rubbia (b. 1934)
and the Dutch physicist
Simon van der Meer (b.
1925). They shared the Nobel
Prize for physics in 1984.

Extrasolar
Planets

IRAS, a satellite designed
to detect infrared radiation,
picked up such radiation in

the immediate neighbor-
hood of the bright star Vega
in 1983.

The best way of inter-
preting the radiation was
to suppose that a ring of
particles surrounded the
star, rather like a rich aster-
oid belt. It was at once sug-
gested that such a belt
might be in the process of
condensing into planets or
be an indication that plan-
ets existed already.

In any case, this was
the best evidence yet that
stars other than the Sun
might possess planets and
that such extrasolar planets
might even be common.

Nuclear Winter

The speculative accounts
of a comet strike on Earth
sixty-five million years ago,
which may have put an end
to the dinosaurs, partly be-
cause a vast cloud of dust
raised into the upper atmo-
sphere by the strike had cut
off sunlight (see 1979), in-
spired thoughts concerning
nuclear war.

A group of people, of
whom Carl Sagan (b. 1935)
was most prominent, sug-
gested that in the case of an
all-out nuclear war, the ex-
plosion of thousands of nu-

clear bombs would raise
enough dust to cut off sun-
light for a considerable pe-
riod and produce a nuclear
winter. Mass starvation
would then follow for the
whole planet, not only for
the loser of the nuclear ex-
change but for the “win-
ner'" as well, and for all the
neutrals.

The predicted intensity
of such a nuclear winter
seems to have moderated a
bit since the first pessimis-
tic projections, but the side
effects of a nuclear ex-
change in the form of fires,
fallout, and disruption of
the world’s economy would
surely be dreadful enough
even if there were no nu-
clear winter at all.
