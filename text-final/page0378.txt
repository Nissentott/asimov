and the kerosene lamp be-
came almost universal in
the United States and else-
where. Kerosene served to
replace whale oil and to cut
down somewhat on the car-
nage that humanity was vis-
iting on those inoffensive
animals.

Much more than that,
however, lay in the future.

Storage Battery

All the electric batteries
used in the six decades
since Volta had invented
the first one (see 1800) were
one-shot affairs. The chemi-
cal reaction that gave rise
to the electric current even-
tually proceeded to a point
where it could no longer
support current. It then
had to be discarded, for the
chemical reaction could not
be reversed.

Yet some chemical re-
actions are easily revers-
ible. In 1859 a French
physicist, Gaston Planté
(1834—1889), took two
sheets of lead, with an insu-
lating sheet of rubber be-
tween them, rolled the lead
sheets into a spiral, and up-
ended it into dilute sulfuric
acid. He found that a chemi-
cal reaction resulted that
would produce an electric
current. Furthermore,
when the battery was dis-
charged, an electric current
could be forced through it

in the opposite direction,
and the chemical reaction
would be reversed, so that
the battery could eventu-
ally produce an electric cur-
rent again.

Naturally, we are not
getting something for noth-
ing. The second law of ther-
modynamics (see 1850)
would not allow that. The
electrical energy required
to charge a storage battery
is always greater than the
amount it can then deliver.
It would be a lasing propo-
sition, therefore, to charge
a discharged storage bat-
tery from one that was fully
charged. To charge a stor-
age battery, you must get
your electricity from a gen-
erator that makes use of
fuel energy or some other
nonelectrical source of en-
ergy.

Spectral Lines
and Elements

Since their discovery by
Fraunhofer nearly half a
century before (see 1814),
spectral lines had not been
connected with chemistry.
The German physicist
Gustav Robert Kirchhoff
(1824-1887), however, had
carefully studied the spec-
tra of light produced when
various elements were
heated to incandescence.
He found that each element
produced light of only cer-

tain wavelengths, so that
the spectrum consisted
sometimes of only a few
lines of light, which were
sometimes well separated.

In 1859 Kirchhoff an-
nounced that every element
produced characteristic
spectral lines, which it also
absorbed when its vapors
were cooler than the light
source. The pattern of lines
was different for each ele-
ment; no two elements
shared spectral lines in ex-
actly the same pasitions. In
essence, each element had a
spectral “fingerprint.”

This meant that if any
sample of ore, on being
heated to incandescence,
produced even a single
spectral line in a position
not recorded for any known
element, then some new ele-
ment must be present in
that ore.

Making use of such
spectroscopic data, Kirch-
hoff discovered cesium in
1860. The name is derived
from the Latin word for
"sky-blue,” since that was
the color of the spectral
line that had given away ce-
sium'’s existence, The next
year Kirchhoff discovered
rubidium, a related ele-
ment, its name coming
from the Latin for “red.”

Kirchhoff also pointed
out that the dark lines in
the solar spectrum were the
result of light being ab-
sorbed by the gases in the
