lished the report in 1911,
and the disease came to be
called the Rous chicken sar-
coma virus. It was the first
of a family of tumor vi-
ruses.

For this work, Rous
was awarded a share of the
Nobel Prize for medicine
and physiology in 1966,
fifty-five years after his
report.

Earthquakes
and Faults

It was known that there
were faults in the Earth’s
crust, regions where two
dissimilar sets of rocks
came together. It was as
though there had been a
smooth stretch of rock origi-
nally, which had cracked,
with one side sliding along
the other to produce a mis-
match. The general feel-
ing was that such faults
were produced by earth-
quakes.

The American geologist
Harry Fielding Reid (1859—
1944) studied the San Fran-
cisco earthquake and came
to the conclusion, in 1911,
that the reverse was true.
The fault existed first, and
the earthquake resulted
when pressure upon the
fault caused it to slip fur-
ther.

This idea has been ac-
cepted ever since.

Seaplanes

The American inventor
Glenn Hammond Curtiss
(1878-1930) was deeply in-
volved in the early airplane
flights. He was the first to
fly a mile in the United
States, in 1908, and he flew
from Albany te New York
in 1910.

In 1911 he finally built
a practical seaplane, or hy-
droplane, with pontoons
rather than wheels, that
could take off and land on
water.

South Pole

Peary's attainment of the
North Pole (see 1909) sharp-
ened the race to reach the
South Pole. This was a
more difficult objective, for
the South Pole was more
distant from important
population centers, and it
was at the center of a land-
mass, so that it was consid-
erably colder than the
North Pole.

The Norwegian ex-
plorer Roald Amundsen
(1872—1928) had already
made his way by sea across
the northern border of
North America in 1903
(achieving the Northwest
Passage at last). Now he
prepared for a race to the
South Pole.

In October 1911 he
set off, with dogs (who
could eat meat—and each

other, in case of need),
reaching the South Pole on
December 14 and returning
safely.

The British explorer
Robert Falcon Scott (1868—
1912) was also trying to
reach the pole, but he
didn’t plan his expedition
as well. He ran into enor-
mous misfortune, reached
the South Pole a month
after Amundsen did, and
perished with his party on
the way back.

Self-Starter

The automobile still had
to be started manually by
inserting a crank into the
front of the car, where

it could grip the rotor

of the engine, forcing it

to turn and “catch.” That
took a great effort, and
sometimes when the en-
gine caught, the crank
began to turn at great
speed, pulled out of the
cranker’s hand, and broke
his arms.

The American inventor
Charles Franklin Kettering
(1876-1958) invented an
electric starter in 1911 that
would do the job at the
turn of a key. It was used in
the 1912 Cadillac and
quickly grew popular. With
the crank gone, automo-
biles could be started and
driven by far more people,
which greatly spread the
antomobile way of life.
