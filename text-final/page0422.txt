Malaria

Malaria is perhaps the

most widespread and debil-
itating disease in the world.
It was only the discovery of
quinine nearly two and a
half centuries before that
had made it possible for Eu-
ropeans to maintain them-
selves in the tropics.

In 1880 a French physi-
cian, Charles-Louis-
Alphonse Laveran (1845—
1922), isolated the microor-
ganism that caused malaria
and, to everyone's astonish-
ment, found it to be not a
bacterium but a protozoon,
a one-celled animal. It was
the first pathogenic organ-
ism to be found that was
anything but a bacterium.

For this discovery, La-
veran received the Nobel
Prize in physiology and
medicine in 1907.

Other bacteriologists
were identifying patho-
genic microorganisms, t00.
In 1880, for instance, the
German bacteriologist Karl
Joseph Eberth (1835-1926)
identifed the bacillus that
caused typhoid fever.

Nebular
Photography

As the art of photography
advanced, it grew steadily
more important in astron-
omy. In 1880 Draper (see
1872), who had learned the
use of dry plates from Hug-
gins (see 1863), used the
new technique to photo-
graph the Orion nebula and
to study its spectrum. It
was the first time a nebula
had been photographed.

From its spectrum, it
was possible to deduce that
the Orion nebula was a
cloud of dust and gas lit by
stars that must be embed-
ded in it. It would be natu-
ral to suppose, as a result,
that all other nebulas
might be of such composi-
tion, but within forty years
it turned out that there
were all-important excep-
tions.

Seismograph

The first attempt to develop
a device that would mea-
sure the strength of earth-
quakes had been made by
Palmieri (see 1855). In 1880
the first modern seismo-
graph (from Greek words
meaning “‘to record earth-

quakes’) was devised by a
British geologist, John
Milne (1850-1913). This
was, essentially, a hori-
zontal pendulum, one end
of which was fixed in bed-
rock. When the ground
moved as a result of a
quake, the motion was re-
corded on a turning drum
by a pen (eventually by a
ray of light). Milne estab-
lished a chain of seismo-
graphs in Japan and
elsewhere, which marked
the beginning of modern
seismology.

Gadolinium

Marignac, who had discov-
ered ytterbium (see 1878),
discovered yet another rare
earth element in 1880. This
time Gadolin, who had dis-
covered the rare earths (see
1794), was honored, and
the element was named gad-
olinitum.

Unconscious

.
Mind
In 1880 an Austrian physi-
cian, Josef Breuer (1842
1925), acquired a new pa-
tient whom he referred to

as “Anna O.” She suffered
from various psychological
