1816

 

Stethoscope

Diagnostic procedures were
limited in the early days of
modern medicine, but one
obvious way of getting in-
formation was to place the
ear to the chest wall and lis-
ten to the sound of the
heartbeat. In 1816 a French
physician, René-Théophile-
Hyacinthe Laénnec (1781—
1826), was faced with the
necessity of listening to the
heartbeat of a plump young
woman with a heart condi-
tion. He felt that trying to

hear the heart through the
barrier of the breasts would
be ineffective, while at-
tempting to lift or separate
the breasts for better hear-
ing would be indelicate.

In a moment of inspira-
tion, he bent a notebook
into a cylinder and put one
end between the woman'’s
breasts and the other end
to his ear. He was pleased
to find that the heart
sounds were actually
louder than they would
have been if he had placed
his ear directly to the

breastbone. He therefore
prepared wooden cylinders
for the purpose of listening
to the heartbeat and thus
invented the stethoscope
(from Greek words mean-
ing “to view the chest”).

The stethoscope, stead-
ily improved, of course, be-
came so essential an
adjunct of the medical pro-
fession that medical stu-
dents with their
stethoscopes became as ste-
reotypical as engineering
students with their slide
rules.
