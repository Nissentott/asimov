Binary System

Our system of positional no-
tation for numbers is based
on ten, undoubtedly be-
cause we have ten fingers
on our two hands. There is,
however, nothing magic
about the figure 10. Instead
of units, tens, hundreds

(10 x 10s), thousands (10
X 10 x 10s), and so on, we
could have units, eights,
sixty-fours (8 x 8s), five-

hundred-twelves (8 x 8

X 8s), and so on, or ones,
seventeens, two-hundred-
eighty-nines (17 x 17s),
four-thousand-nine-
hundred-thirteens (17 x 17
% 17s), and so onâ€”or any
number.

This was pointed out
by Leibniz (see 1669, Calcu-
lus) about 1700. Some
bases for positional nota-
tion are, of course, more
convenient than others.

Using the base 12 or 8 each
has some advantages over
10. Leibniz also showed
that the binary system
based on 2 had its uses. Its
positions were units, twos,
fours, eights, sixteens, and
s0 on. The only symbeols it
needed were 1 and 0. The
binary system is particu-
larly useful for modern
computers.
