Alloy Steel

For three thousand years,
steel (carbonized iron) had
been the strongest material
known for tools, structures,
and weapons, but that
didn’t mean it couldn’t be
improved.

Attempts were made to
improve the qualities of
steel by adding other met-
als. Manganese was one of
the metals tried, but it
seemed to make the steel
more brittle. A British met-
allurgist, Robert Abbott
Hadfield (1858—1940),
added more manganese

than others had thought ad-
visable, however, and when
the steel was 12 percent
manganese, it was no
longer brittle. If it was then
heated to 1,000° C and
quenched, it became su-
perhard. Where ordinary
steel used for railroad rails
had to be replaced every
nine months, rails made of
manganese-steel lasted
twenty-two years.

Hadfield patented his
manganese-steel in 1883,
and that marked the begin-
ning of the triumph of alloy
steel. Other metals were
then added to steel in vary

ing quantities and mixtures
—chromium, tungsten,
molybdenum, vanadium,
niobium, and so on—in
search of alloys with new
and useful properties.

Alternating
Currents

Electric currents, as used in
the first half of the nine-
teenth century, flowed from
one point to another in one
direction. That is the kind

batteries, and it is direct
current (de). It is easier, in
