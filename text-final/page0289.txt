 

ergy crossing over rough
ground. A smooth road
would have to be built.

It occurred to a British
inventor, Richard Trevi-
thick (1771-1833), that
what was needed was iron
rails on which the wheels
would fit and along which

they could move, a railroad.

He showed that, even if the
rails were smooth and the
wheels rolling on them
were smooth as well, there
was still sufficient traction
for the locomotive to move
itself and a train of coaches
attached. Trevithick
showed this by actual dem-
onstration as early as 1801.
In 1804, one of his locomo-
tives pulled five loaded
coaches for 9.5 miles at
nearly 5 miles an hour.
Nevertheless, Trevi-

1805

thick could not manage to
turn his locomotive into a
commercial success.

Missouri River

President Jefferson wanted
the new territory of Louisi-
ana to be explored. For the
purpose, he chose Meri-
wether Lewis (1774—1809),
who in turn chose William
Clark (1770-1838). These
two, with a party of about
forty young men, made up
the Lewis and Clark Expedi-
tion.

They went to St. Louis
where they remained over
the winter of 1803—-1804.

Then on May 14, 1804, they

moved up the Missouri

River and followed it back
to its source. This brought
them to the American bor-

der, but they went on any-
way into the Oregon
Territory, the only part of
the American continents
that had still not been effec-
tively claimed by any one
power. They followed the
Columbia River to the Pa-
cific Ocean, which they
reached on November 15,
1805, and then returned to
St. Louis, which they
reached on September 23,
1806. This was the first trip
across the United States
from ocean to ocean and
back. The Lewis and Clark
Expedition brought back in-
formation on the Indian
tribes of the region, on ani-
mal life (including huge
herds of bison), on plant
life, and on natural fea-
tures.

 

 

Morphine

The use of certain plants to
dull pain and discomfort
and to give a feeling of

well-being is old indeed. In
Homer’s Odyssey, mention
is made of those who ate

the lotus and forgot all else,

craving only to continue

 

eating it. There is also men-
tion of a drug nepenthe,
which calmed and soothed.
It is very tempting to think
of these as representing
