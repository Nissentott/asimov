 

attached, which would
form polymers something
like polyethylene (in which
all the carbon valences
were attached to hydrogen
atoms). Fluorine atoms
held much more tightly to
the carbon chain than hy-
drogen atoms did, however.
For that reason, long-chain
polytetra-fluoroethylene (or
Teflon for short) resisted
change. It didn’t burn, dis-
solve, or stick to anything.

In 1944 Teflon was first
produced for commercial
use as a lining for frying
pans. Since material would
not stick to it, oil did not
need to be used, and the fry-
ing pans were easily
cleaned after use. Nor was
the material in any way
toxic.

Synthesis of
Quinine
By now the techniques and
methods of organic synthe-
sis were so advanced that
any organic molecule, no
matter how complex, could
be synthesized.

Perkin had attempted
to synthesize quinine (see
1856) but was bound to fail,
since its molecule was too
complex for the methods
then available.

In 1944, however, the
American chemists Robert
Burns Woodward (1917
1979) and William von Eg-

gers Doering (b. 1917)
began with simple com-
pounds that could be easily
synthesized from their con-
stituent elements, and from
these they synthesized qui-
nine.

Woodward went on to
synthesize other compli-
cated molecules and was
eventually awarded the
Nobel Prize for chemistry
in 1965.

2,4-D

The chemical 2,4-dichloro-
phenoxyacetic acid (2,4-D
for short) was introduced in
1944 and was the first effec-
tive chemical herbicide
(Latin for “plant killer”).
Naturally, killing plant life
indiscriminately is not
something one would want
to do, but 2,4-D is selective
in its effects. It does not se-
riously affect grasses (in-
cluding the various grains
so important to humanity)
but prevents the growth of
broad-leaved plants, usu-
ally regarded as weeds.

New Nebular
Hypothesis

For nearly two centuries,
astronomers had been try-
ing to work out some rea-
sonable mechanism that
would account for the for-
mation of the Solar Sys-
tem. Laplace’s nebular

hypothesis (see 1796) had
broken down over the fact
that 98 percent of the angu-
lar momentum of the Solar
System was concentrated
in the planets, which made
up only 0.1 percent of the
total mass of the system.

Chamberlin had ad-
vanced the planetesimal the-
ory (see 1905), which
required a near collision
that would draw out solar
matter by gravitational
pull and form the planets.
Eddington (see 1919), how-
ever, showed the interior of
stars to be so incredibly hot
that matter pulled out of
the Sun would simply dis-
perse and not collect into
planets.

In 1944 Weizsacker (see
1938) worked out a new ver-
sion of the nebular hypothe-
sis. He introduced the
notion of turbulence in the
outer layers of the condens-
ing nebula and showed
how, as a result of such tur-
bulence, planets would
form in their actual ob-
served orbits, more or less.

Furthermore, the devel-
opment of magnetohydrody-
namics at just about this
time, by the Swedish as-
tronomer Hannes Olof
Gosta Alfvén (b. 1908),
showed how thin gases
moved when immersed in
magnetic fields and how
they could carry energy
and angular momentum
outward. This solved the
