 

James Lind (1716—1794),
had served in the navy and
knew that the diet on board
ship was monotonous in
the extreme, consisting of
hardtack, salt pork, and
other food items whose
only virtue was that they
didn'’t spoil in an age with-
out refrigeration or can-
ning. He also knew that

scurvy appeared in prisons,
in besieged towns, on over-
land exploring expeditions
—always where diet was
limited and monotonous.
Lind therefore studied
the effect of adding food
items that didn’t last well,
especially fruits and vegeta-
bles, to the diet of people af-
fected with scurvy. In 1747

he found that citrus fruits
worked amazingly well in
effecting relief. It was
nearly half a century, how-
ever, before the British
navy could bestir itself to
make use of that fact and
put an end to the menace of
scurvy.

Osmosis

It is a common observation
that liquids will soak
through some materials but
not others. But if a liquid
soaks through a particular
material, it seems reason-
able to suppose that it will
soak through in either di-
rection.

Nevertheless, when a
French experimenter, Jean-
Antoine Nollet (1700—
1770), covered an alcoholic
solution with a section of
pig’s bladder and placed it
in a tub of water, the blad-

N

der began to bulge over a
period of time as though
more water was entering
the solution than was leav-
ing it. Eventually, the blad-
der membrane burst,

In this way, Nollet dis-
covered what is now called
a semipermeable membrane
—that is, one permeable to
some fluids but not to oth-
ers. If there are different
fluids on the two sides of
such a membrane (pure
water on one side, for in-
stance, and an alcoholic so-
lution on the other), the
fluid flow in one direction

may be greater than in the
other. This is called osnio-
sis (from a Greek word
meaning “push,” since the
fluid ends by pushing
through in one direction).

The explanation for os-
mosis had to wait half a
century till the notion of
molecules of different sizes
was understood.
