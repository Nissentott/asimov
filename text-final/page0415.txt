Protein Size

The fact of osmosis—that
some substances could go
through certain mem-
branes while others could
not—had been known for
two decades. In 1877 a Ger-
man botanist, Wilhelm
Friedrich Philipp Pfeffer
(1845-1920), explained the
phenomenon by showing
that large molecules would
not go through, while small
ones would. If all the large
molecules were on one side
of the membrane, they
would block the passage of
some of the small ones.
That meant that more
small molecules would pass
through from the side that
lacked the large molecules.
The side with the large mol-
ecules would then swell, as
more small molecules en-
tered than left, and it
would experience an os-
motic pressure.

Pfeffer showed how one
might measure this osmotic
pressure and related that

pressure to the size of the
molecules that could not
pass through the mem-
brane. If a particular pro-
tein was on one side of the
membrane, then from the
osmotic pressure developed
on that side Pfeffer could
calculate the molecular
weight of the protein. Pfef-
fer was also the first to de-
termine the molecular
weights of proteins and to
show that they were macro-
molecules made up of hun-
dreds, even thousands, of
atoms.

Liquid Oxygen

The work of Andrews (see
1869) and of van der Waals
(see 1873) had emphasiz
the fact that gases that re-
sisted liquefaction had to
be cooled as far as possible
before pressure could be
usefully applied, or the
Joule-Thomson cooling-by-
expansion effect attempted.
In 1877 a French physi-

 

cist, Louis-Paul Cailletet
(1832-1913), cooled oxygen
intensively and then let it
expand. He got a fog of lig-
uid droplets of oxygen. By
using similar techniques,
he also managed to get
small quantities of

liquid nitrogen and

liquid carbon menoxide

as well.

A Swiss chemist,
Raoul-Pierre Pictet (1846—
1929), managed to do this
independently in the same
year. Using a more elabo-
rate method, he produced
greater quantities of the lig-
uids.

As it turned out, oxy-
gen liquefied at —183°C
(90° K): carbon monoxide
at —191° C (82° K); and ni-
trogen at — 196° C (77° K).
The only known gas that re-
mained a gas at the temper-
ature that sufficed to
liquefy nitrogen was hydro-
gen. (Two other

 

 

vet unknown, would also
have remained unliquefi-
able at this time.)
