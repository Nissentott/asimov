Dodo

Mauritius is an island
about half again as large as
the state of Rhode Island,
located in the Indian Ocean
500 miles east of Madagas-
car. In 1598 the Dutch set-
tled it and named it after
Maurice of Nassau (see

1586). The Dutch stayed, on
and off, till 1710.

Mauritius had forms of
life that had evolved in iso-
lation and that were differ-
ent from forms elsewhere.
For example, there was the
dodo, a flightless pigeon,
larger than a turkey and
with a huge hooked bill. It

was harmless and unafraid
(hence its name, perhaps)
since there was nothing on
Mauritius to threaten it.
Once settlers arrived,
however, they and their do-
mestic animals began to
kill this inoffensive bird.
This continued until the
very last dodo died about
