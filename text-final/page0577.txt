awarded the Nobel prize
for physics in 1939.

Computer

Babbage had tried to build
a machine that would solve
complicated mathematical
problems by purely me-
chanical means (see 1822).
He was defeated by the fact
that mechanical methods of
the day were, by and large,
too coarse to do the work.

By the 1920s, engineers
had at their disposal elec-
tric currents, together with
radio tubes to control those
currents. These cut down
on the number of moving
parts needed and supplied
a much more delicate way
of controlling the parts of
what came to be called a
compuiter,

In 1930 the American
electrical engineer Van-
nevar Bush (1890-1974)
produced the first machine
capable of solving differen-
tial equations and the first
one that Babbage would
have recognized as fulfill-
ing his design. However,
Bush's computer was only
partly electronic.

Crystalline
Enzymes

Sumner had crystallized

urease and shown that one
enzyme at least was a pro-

tein (see 1926). He had little
reputation in the field, how-
ever, and biochemists gen-
erally hesitated to accept
his results in the face of con-
trary views by much better-
known biochemists such as
Willstatter (see 1906).

In 1930, however, the
American biochemist John
Howard Northrop (1891â€”
1987) managed to crystal-
lize, not a rather off-beat en-
zyme such as urease, but
the very well-known diges-
tive enzyme pepsin and
showed it to be a protein.
That really settled the mat-
ter (especially when Nor-
throp went on to crystallize
other well-known enzymes
as well).

The result was that
Northrop was awarded a
share (along with Sumner)
of the Nobel Prize for chem-
istry in 1946.

Vitamin A
Structure

Vitamins had been known
and worked with and used
in nutrition and medicine
for a third of a century, but
they still remained mysteri-
ous, because their molecu-
lar structure was not
known.

In 1930, however, the
Swiss chemist Paul Karrer
(1889-1971) showed that vi-
tamin A was related to the
carotenoids, of which the

most familiar is carotene,
the coloring matter of car-
rots. Other carotenoids are
found in sweet potatoes,
egg volk, tomatoes, lobster
shells, and human skin.

Vitamin A rather re-
sembled half a molecule of
carotene. This was finally
proved when Karrer even-
tually synthesized it, which
led to a rash of molecular
determinations and syn-
theses of other vitamins,
and the mystery (of their
structure, at least) was
removed.

Freon

By now, refrigerators and
air-conditioners existed,
and general use was made
of liquids that could be
evaporated and so draw
heat from the surrounding
environment, thus lowering
the temperature, as in the
method used for liquefying
gases.

The main trouble was
that the gases used for the
purpose were ammonia and
sulfur dioxide, for the most
part, and that these had
choking odors and were ac-
tually poisonous, so that
leaks in the system were
bound to be uncomfortable
and might be dangerous.

It would be ideal if one
could find a liquid that was
odorless, easily evaporated,
nonpoisonous, and stable.

Just such a liquid was
