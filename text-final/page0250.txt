Fertilization

In early times, it was taken
for granted that male
human beings provided the
“seed” and that females
were merely the soil within
which the seed developed.
If no children were born, it
was assumed that the
woman involved, like de-
sert soil, was “barren.”

In 1779 Spallanzani
(see 1768) studied the devel-
opment of eggs. At that
time, it was thought that
the ovarian follicles (discov-
ered by the Dutch anato-
mist Reinier de Graaf
[1641-1673] in 1673 and
still called Graafian follicles
as a result) were the eggs.

Spallanzani showed
that fertilization did not
take place unless the sperm
cells in the semen actually
made physical contact with
the follicles. This was a
strong indication that re-
production was not a one-
sided affair, but that both
mother and father contrib-
uted to the birth of a child
and that either side might
be at fault in case children
were not born.

Photosynthesis

Joseph Priestley had shown
that plants could make air
breathable after it had been
filled with carbon dioxide
(see 1771).In 1779 a Dutch

physician, Jan Ingenhousz
(1730-1799), repeated the
experiments and confirmed
Priestley’s findings. His cru-
cial added discovery, how-
ever, was that plants
consumed carbon dioxide
and produced oxygen only
in the light. In the dark,
plants, like animals, con-
sumed oxygen and pro-
duced carbon dioxide.

Because of the impor-
tance of light, and because
plants in the process pro-
duced not only light but
also the large molecules of
their tissues, the process
came to be called photosyn-
thesis, from Greek words
meaning “to put together
by light.”
