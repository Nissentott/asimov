Sea Navigation

Boats had been in existence
for over two thousand
years, but they had been
confined to rivers. When
they did venture out to sea,
they generally hugged the
coast. Even the Cretans, the
boldest seagoers up to this
time, had confined them-
selves to the eastern Medi-
terranean and felt safest in
the Aegean Sea, where nu-
merous islands made possi-
ble short sails from land to
land.

Greek legends treated
distant portions of the sea
as places of myth and mys-
tery. The tale of Jason and
the Argonauts reflects early
ventures into the large and
island-free Black Sea.
Homer's Odyssey describes
the adventures of Odysseus
in the even larger western
Mediterranean.

The first to cast out
boldly into the open sea
were the Phoenicians. They
noted that the seven stars
that made up the familiar
grouping of the Big Dipper
were always located to the
north and were visible all
night long at every season
of the year (barring the
presence of clouds). This
must surely have been
known for a long time, but
the Phoenicians seem to
have been the first who
were willing to risk their
ships and lives on the fact.
By observing the Big Dip-
per, they knew always
which direction was north,
and from that they knew all
other directions. This obvi-
ated the fear of being lost
once out of sight of land
and “landmarks."” There
were always the “sky-
marks,” so to speak.

In addition, the Phoeni-

cians refused to depend on
sails and wind alone. The
wind was erratic, after all,
so the Phoenicians used
oars, which the Egyptians
had been using on the Nile
for twenty centuries. Oared
ships (galleys) now ruled
the Mediterranean for
twenty-six centuries.

Using oars, and keep-
ing the Big Dipper on the
right, the Phoenician ship
captains could sail boldly
westward, knowing they
could return by remember-
ing to keep the Big Dipper
on the left. Beginning about
1100 B.c. then, the Phoeni-
cians explored the coasts of
northern Africa west of
Egypt and southern Europe
west of Greece, trading and
in some cases settling.
