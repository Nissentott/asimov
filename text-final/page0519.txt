Quantized
Atom

Now that Rutherford had
formulated the nuclear
atom (see 1911), it was pos-
sible to view the hydrogen
atom as consisting of a nu-
cleus (bearing a charge of
+1) and a single electron
(with a charge of —1) cir-
cling it.

One could argue that
the electron, as it circled
the nucleus, in effect oscil-
lated from side to side. This
oscillation, according to
Maxwell’s equations,
should result in electromag-
netic radiation. But if this
were so, the electron would
lose energy as it circled and
would spiral into the nu-
cleus.

The Danish physicist
Niels Henrik David Bohr
(1885-1962) tried to solve
this problem by applying
quantum theory to the
atom. The electron, he de-
cided, could not radiate
energy except in intact
quanta, each of which rep-
resented a large amount of
energy on the atomic scale.
Consequently the electron,
when it radiated, would
lose a large packet of en-

ergy and would not spiral
into the nucleus gradually
but drop very suddenty to a
lower orbit nearer the nu-
cleus. It would do this each
time it radiated a quantum
of energy. Eventually it
would reach the lowest or-
bital state, below which it
couldn’t fall, and it would
then emit no more energy.

In reverse, if the atom
absorbed energy, the elec-
tron would suddenly rise to
a higher orbit, and this
would continue with fur-
ther absorption of energy
until it left the atom alto-
gether, at which time the
atom would be ionized, be-
coming a fragment with a
positive charge equal in
size to the number of elec-
trons that had been boiled
off, so to speak.

As electrons rose to
higher orbits and fell to
lower orbits, they would ra-
diate only certain wave-
lengths, and under other
conditions, absorb those
same wavelengths, as
Kirchhoff had shown over
half a century before (see
1859).

The presence of many
electrons rising and falling
in orbits might confuse the
issue, but hydrogen, with
its single electron, should
be easier to handle. Indeed,
hydrogen has a simple spec-
trum, giving off radiation
at a series of wavelengths

=

that can be related to each
other by a rather simple
equation. This equation
had been worked out by a
Swiss physicist, Johann
Jakob Balmer (1825-1898),
in 1885. It had not seemed
to have much significance
at the time, but now Bohr
could choose orbits for a hy-
drogen electron that would
yield just those wave-
lengths that the hydrogen
spectrum displayed.

Bohr's suggestion
wasn't perfect. There were
fine details of the hydrogen
spectrum that it couldn’t
account for. There was also
no explanation of why the
electron, when it was in a
particular orbit and oscil-
lating back and forth,

did not lose energy. If it
couldn't give off an entire
quantum, why didn't it
stop oscillating?

Bohr's suggestion, how-
ever, was the first applica-
tion of quantum theory to
the atom and was enor-
mously important for that
reason, The imperfections
were gradually removed
in succeeding years, and
for his work, Bohr was
awarded the Nobel Prize
for physics in 1922.
