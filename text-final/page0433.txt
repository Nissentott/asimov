Heat and
Temperature

Stefan had related heat
emission to the fourth
power of the temperature
(see 1879), and in 1884, the
matter was taken up fur-
ther by the Austrian physi-
cist Ludwig Eduard
Boltzmann (1844-1906),
who had once served Stefan

as a laboratory assistant.
Boltzmann had earlier in-
creased the rigor of the
mathematical treatment of
thermodynamics and had
emphasized the statistical
interpretation of t
law of thermodynamics, so
that he is considered the
founder of statistical
mechanic

Boltzmann showed
