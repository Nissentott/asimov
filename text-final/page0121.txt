Comets’ Tails

in the 1530s, no fewer than
six comets appeared in the
sky. Fired by the example
of Regiomontanus (sec¢
1472), astronomers viewed
them calmly. One of these
was Girolamo Fracastoro,
who had coined the word

syphilis (see 1495). In 1538
he published a book in

which he recorded his ob-
servations and mentioned
that a comet’s tail always

puinted away from the Sun.

A German astronomer,
Peter Bennewitz (in Latin
Petrus Apianus; 1501 -
1552), also studying these

comets, published a book in
1540 in which he came to
the same conclusion inde-
pendently. He published
the first scientilic drawing
of a comet, in which he indi-
cated the position of the

tail with reference 1o the
Sun.
