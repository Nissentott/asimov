lower one. The first practi-
cal device of this sort was
produced in 1962.

Such diodes are now
routinely used where light
needs merely to be seen and
not to illuminate. Thus, light-
emitting diodes are used
bin digital clocks, in pocket
computers, in elevator floor
indicators, in taxi meters,
and as signals in electronic
equipment generally.

Quasars

Among the radio sources lo-
cated in the sky during the
1950s were a few that
seemed confined to very

small areas. These compact
sources were known as
3C48, 3C147, 3C196, 3C273,
and 3C286. The 3C is short
for Third Cambridge Catalog
of Radio Stars, a listing

 

compiled by the British as-
tronomer Martin Ryle
(1918-1984).

In 1960 these sources

were pinpointed, by such
