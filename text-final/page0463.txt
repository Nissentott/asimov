been interested in was po-
tassium uranyl sulfate. In
February 1896 Becquerel
wrapped photographic film
in black paper and put it in
sunlight with a crystal of
potassium uranyl sulfate
upon it. He reasoned that
sunlight would make the
crystal fluoresce, and any X
rays it produced would pen-
etrate the black paper (as
ordinary light would not)
and fog the photographic
plate.

Sure enough the plate
was fogged and Becquerel
decided that fluorescence
did produce X rays. But
then came a series of
cloudy days and Becquerel
could not continue his ex-
periments. He had a fresh
plate neatly wrapped in the
drawer with a crystal rest-
ing upon it, but there was
no sunlight to expose it to.
Finally, unable to bear
doing nothing, he devel-
oped the film anyway, just
to make sure that nothing
happened in the absence of
sunlight.

To his amazement, the
film was strongly fogged.
Whatever radiation was
passing through the paper
did not depend on either
sunlight or fluorescence.

For this discovery, Bec-
querel received a share of
the Nobel Prize in physics
in 1903 and rightly so, for it
had enormous conse-

quences.

Dietary
Deficiency
Diseases

People in the Dutch East In-
dies commonly suffered
from beriberi, which pro-
duced weakness and death.
Naturally it was assumed
to be a germ disease, since
Pasteur (see 1862) and oth-
ers had been so successful
at combating disease on
that assumption. However,
no one could find the

germ that caused the
disease.

A Dutch physician,
Christiaan Eijkman (1858—
1930), who had gone to the
East Indies to study the dis-
ease, was nonplussed. But
then an ailment broke out
in 1896 among the chickens
being used at the labora-
tory for bacteriological re-
searches. The chicken
polyneuritis showed symp-
toms similar to beriberi,
and Eijkman was busily
studying the disease and
checking on its conta-
giousness—when it sud-
denly disappeared and all
the chickens got well.

Eijkman investigated
and found that during the
period when the chickens
had had the disease, they
had been feeding on rice or-
dinarily meant for the
human patients. The dis-
ease disappeared when a
new cook put them back on

commiercial chicken feed.
Eijkman found he could
produce the chicken disease
at will when he fed the
chickens polished rice. By
feeding them unpolished
rice, he cured them.

Eijkman was the first
to correct a specific disease
by diet since Lind had con-
nected citrus fruits and
scurvy (see 1747). Although
Eijkman missed the point
at first, it became clear that
beriberi was a dietary defi-
ciency disease. It was
caused by the absence of
some substance (present in
the hulls of unpolished rice
and not present in polished
rice from which the hulls
had been removed) that
seemed necessary to health
in small traces.

For this discovery, Eijk-
man received a share of the
Nobel Prize in physiology
and medicine in 1929.

Light and
Magnetism

Maxwell had maintained
that an oscillating elec-
tric charge could produce
radiation (see 1865), and
Hertz had shown that to
be correct with his dis-
covery of radio waves
(see 1888). Maxwell had
also maintained that
light was an electromag-
netic radiation, but if so,
what was the electric
