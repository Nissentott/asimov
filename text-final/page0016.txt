 

would cluster near rivers
and lakes for that purpose.

Water would offer
them a source of food, too,
and they would venture out
into it to catch fish. People
would learn to swim. In ad-
dition, they could not help
but notice that wood floats.
By 6000 B.c., they must
have learned how to lash
logs together to form rafts
that would keep them out
on the surface of quiet bod-
ies of water for a time. By
paddling with their hands,
if nothing else, they could
even cross small stretches
of water.

Sickles

Human beings had to in-
vent devices that would be
of help in dealing with the
plants they were trying to
exploit. The ripe stalks of
grain would have to be cut
down, and as early as 6000
B.C., sickles (from a Latin
word meaning “to cut’)
were used for that purpose.
They were essentially
knives (originally of sharp-
ened stone) at the end of
sticks, which could be used
to slash at the base of the
stalks.

Once the stalks were

cut down, the grain could
be rubbed between two
stones to eliminate the
chaff and reduce the starch
to powder. One stone
would have a depression
into which the grain could
be poured, and the other
would be rounded and
could be used for grinding,
impelled by muscle power.
Such a hand-mill is called a
quern.

 

Irrigation
Agriculture requires a
steady supply of water to
keep the plants alive, so it
naturally started where
rainfall could be counted
upon to a reasonable ex-
tent. Rainfall, however,
even at best, is a chancy
thing, and droughts are all
too common.

One reliable source of
fresh water (the salt water
of the sea won't work) is a

sizable river. Farms there-
fore began to develop along
riverbanks.

Whereas rain falls di-
rectly on the crops, how-
ever, river water generally
remains within its banks.
In order to correct that situ-
ation, it is necessary to dig
ditches so that water will
flow outward from the river
and soak the ground in
which the plants are grow-
ing. These ditches have to
be kept in order and not al-

lowed either to silt up or to
overflow.

What'’s more, when the
river’s water level falls dur-
ing a drought, the ditches
have to be dug deeper. And
since the river occasionally
rises in periods of heavier-
than-usual rains (not neces-
sarily at the site of the
farms, but many miles
away, nearer the river’s
source), levees have to be
built to confine the rising
water within the banks.
