of controversy. First, it and
Great Britain both claimed
all the Oregon Territory
from the Spanish territory
of California up to the
boundary with Russian
Alaska. Second, there was a
dispute over the boundary
between Texas and Mexico,
with the United States
claiming land all the way
to the Rio Grande. It
seemed unlikely that Great
Britain would fight over Or-
egon, but it looked as
though Mexico would fight
over Texas.

1846

 

The potato crop failed
in Europe in 1845 and a
widespread famine re-
sulted. This was worst in
Ireland where the potatoes
were particularly suscepti-
ble and where the peas-
antry lived on virtually
nothing else. One and a half
million Irish (nearly a fifth
of the population) either
died of starvation or emi-
grated (mostly to the
United States).

In America, a religious
zealot, William Miller
(1782-1849), had predicted
the end of the world in

1843 on the basis of his Bib-
lical studies. Like all such
predictions, nothing came
of it. Nevertheless, his fol-
lowers founded the Ad-
ventist Church in 1845,
which eventually became
the Seventh-Day Ad-
ventists, because they cele-
brated the Sabbath on
Saturday. They continue to
expect an imminent end to
the world.

 

Anesthesia

Pain, however useful as a
warning signal designed to
keep living organisms from
damaging themselves too
badly, becomes useless
agony when operations
must be performed.

Attempts to control
pain were many. The use of
alcohol or some form of
what came to be called hyp-
notism was old. Acupunc-
ture was used in the Orient.
The new chemistry also
contributed nitrous oxide,
which, when inhaled,
served to suppress the sen-
sation of pain.

As time went on, sub-
stances such as diethyl

ether (more commonly
called simply ether) and
chloroform were found to
cause unconsciousness dur-
ing which the sensation of
pain disappeared. Ether
came to be used by physi-
cians during operations,
the first to do so being an
American physician, Craw-
ford Williamson Long
(1815-1878), who used it in
1842 to remove a tumor. He
did not publish or publicize
his work, however.

An American dentist,
William Thomas Green
Morton (1819-1868), used
ether on a patient in Sep-
tember 1846, when ex-
tracting a tooth. The
patient himself told the tale

to a newspaper, and Mor-
ton was urged to demon-
strate the use of ether
during an operation at Mas-
sachusetts General Hospi-
tal.

It was this demonstra-
tion that effectively intro-
duced the practice into
medicine, so that Morton
usually gets credit for the
discovery. The American
physician Oliver Wendell
Holmes (1809-1894) sug-
gested the term anesthesia,
from Greek words meaning
“no sensation.”
