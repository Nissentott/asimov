thereafter, though they did
appear if he boiled the solu-
tion for shorter periods.
The conclusion was
that there was no spontaie-
ous generation even for mi-
croorganisms.

Australia

Transits of Venus occur in
pairs, eight years apart,
with over a century be-
tween pairs. Since there
was one in 1761, there
would be another in 1769.
In 1768, therefore, the En-
glish navigator James Cook
(1728-1779), usually called
Captain Cook, was sent out
on a voyage to the Pacific
Ocean. He was to observe
the transit from the newly
discovered island of
Tahiti.

In the course of this
voyage, he was the first to
explore, thoroughly, the

shores of Australia and to
get an idea of its size
Though earlier explorers
had spied its shores, it was
Cook whose reports were
sufficiently detailed to
bring the land clearly to Eu-
ropean attention. For that
reason, he is usually consid-
ered the discoverer of Aus-
tralia. This, and two more
voyages in the years follow-
ing, made Cook the most fa-
mous navigator since
Magellan (see 1523). Cook
crisscrossed the Pacific
Ocean and finally demon-
strated that it had no sig-
nificant land areas in it.
With Australia, the last
major habitable land area
on Earth had been discov-
ered.

In the course of his voy-
ages, Cook made use of
Lind’s dietary discovery
(see 1747) and lost only one
man to scurvy.

Carbonated
Water

An English chemist, Joseph
Priestley (1733-1804), grew
interested in gases in 1768,
partly because he lived
next door to a brewery and
was able to make use of
quantities of the carbon di-
oxide generated in the
brewing process

He found that when he
dissolved some of the car-
bon dioxide in water (car-
bonated water), he created
what he considered a pleas-
antly tart and refreshing
drink, the one we call selt-
zer, or soda water, today.
Since it required only fla-
voring and sugar to pro-
duce soda pop, Priestley
may be viewed as the fa-
ther of today’s gigantic
soft-drink industry.
