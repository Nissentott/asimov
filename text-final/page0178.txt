Conservation of
Momentum

In studying motion, it be-
came clear that motion
wasn't created out of noth-
ing. If some moving object
struck another object at
rest, it might well impart
motion to the second ob-
ject. (Anyone playing bil-
liards can see this.) Yet a
great deal of motion in a
light object would impart
only a small motion to a
heavy object. (Anyone kick-
ing a cannonball can see
this.)

Perhaps if one
multiplied the mass by the
velocity, it would be that
product that stayed the
same. The product of mass
and velocity is called mo-
mentum (from a Latin word
for “movement”). The En-
glish mathematician John
Wallis (1616—1703) was the
first to suggest, in 1668,
that the total momentum of
a closed system (one into
which no momentum from
the outside entered, and

from which no momentum
leaked into the outside) re-
mained always unchanged.
This is called the law of con-
servation of momentum.

Momentum can be
shifted from one part of a
system to another but can
neither be created nor de-
stroyed. Momentum can be
in either of two directions
—let us say, plus or minus.
If one starts off with no mo-
mentum at all in a closed
system, one part may start
moving in one direction
(the plus direction) if an-
other part starts moving in
the opposite (minus) direc-
tion. If the two momenta
(movements) are equal and
opposite, they cancel, and
the total momentum re-
mains zero. Similarly, if
two bodies come together
with equal and opposite
momenta (total, zero), they
can bounce off each other,
having switched the plus
and minus to some extent,
or they can stick together
and both be motionless (the
total always remaining
Zero).

Such a conservation
law explains a great many
things about motion that
would otherwise be puz-
zling. The law of conserva-
tion of momentum was the
first of the conservation
laws to be understood, but
others would, in time, fol-
low, and all are fundamen-
tal to our understanding of
the structure and function-
ing of the Universe.

Spontaneous
Generation

It has always been com-
monly supposed that some
forms of life can arise spon-
taneously from nonlife.
This has been especially so
in connection with life
forms that human beings
do not want—weeds and
vermin. Useful forms of life
require the utmost care,
but useless or harmful
forms seem to flourish de-
spite human effort to eradi-
cate them. It is tempting to
believe that these pests
arise out of nowhere. Be-
