Bronze

Copper obtained from some
ores is harder than from
others. The reason is that
copper ore is not necessar-
ily pure; it may be mixed
with other substances that,
on being heated, combine
with copper to form an
alloy.

One such mixture con-
sists of copper and arsenic,
but arsenic is poisonous,
and people who worked
with it must have fallen
sick. Such mixed ores were
therefore abandoned
(perhaps the first known
case in which worker

safety was a factor in tech-
nology).

Fortunately, another
type of ore mixture was dis-
covered that also resulted
in the smelting of a hard
form of copper. This was a
tin ore, and the hard copper
was actually a copper-tin
alloy. The alloy was called
bronze (possibly from a Per-
sian word for “copper”).

Bronze was hard
enough to compete with
rock. It could hold an edge
better and could, of course
be beaten back into shape if
necessary, though that was
not often required

Increasingly bronze

came to be used for tools
and for weapons and
armor, too. By 3000 B.c

the Middle East was in the
Bronze Age, and this spread
outward slowly in all direc-
tions as the methods of

copper-smelting and

 

bronze formation diffused
The great cultural
product of the Bronze Age
was Homer's Iliad, the tale
of the Trojan War (fought
about 1200 B.c.), in which
both Greek and Trojan

heroes fought in bronze

 

armor, carried bronze
shields, and struck out with
bronze swords and bronze-
tipped spears
