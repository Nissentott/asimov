Cepheid
Variables

There is a group of variable
stars in which the rise and
fall of brightness follows a
distinctive pattern, al-
though the period—the
time taken by one rise and
fall—varies from star to
star. These stars are called
Cepheid variables because
the first one discovered
was in the constellation
Cepheus.

The American astrono-
mer Henrietta Swan Lea-
vitt (1868—1921) was
interested in Cepheid vari-
ables and studied a number
of them in the Magellanic
Clouds, two large groups of
stars that lie beyond the
Milky Way (see 1678).

Her observations, be-
ginning in 1904, showed
that the brighter the Ceph-
eid, the longer the period.
This fact was obscured
among the stars nearer to
us, because some Cepheids
seem dim only because
they are quite far away,
while others seem bright

only because they are near.
In the Magellanic Clouds,
however, all the Cepheids
are about the same dis-
tance from us, so that their
apparent brightness reflects
their real brightness, or lu-
MInosity.

By 1912 Leavitt had
worked out a method for de-
termining the luminosity of
a Cepheid variable from its
period. Once its luminosity
was known, its distance
could be calculated from its
apparent brightness. What
was needed to make this
method work was a reliable
estimate, by some other
method, of the absolute dis-
tance of at least one Ceph-
eid variable. This was a
knotty problem, for even
the nearest Cepheid is too
far away for its absolute dis-
tance to be determined eas-
ily.

Once this was accom-
plished, however, the Ceph-
eid variables could be used
as a yardstick to determine
distances far greater than
those that could be deter-
mined by the method of
parallax (see 150 B.C.).

Nebular
Velocities

The Andromeda nebula,
which had first been ob-
served telescopically ex-
actly three centuries before,
was still rather a puzzle for
astronomers. It seemed to
be a cloud of dust and gas
to the eye, but its light was
similar to starlight in char-
acteristics, even though
no stars were visible within
it

One thing that could
be done was to study its
spectrum and, from the po-
sition of its dark lines,
see whether it was ap-
proaching us or receding
from us. The American as-
tronomer Vesto Melvin
Slipher (1875-1969) made
the measurement in 1912
and reported that it was ap-
proaching Earth at a speed
of 125 miles per second.

This did not seem very
important at the time, but
Slipher went on to deter-
mine the radial velocities of
other nebulae, and such re-
sults led, in the next de-
