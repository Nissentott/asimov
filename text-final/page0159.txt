Gilbert's demonstration
that the Earth was a mag-
net (see 1600) could be used
to explain the fact that the
compass needle did not nec-
essarily point to the truth
north. If the Earth's mag-
netic north pole were not lo-
cated at the geographic
north pole, and if the com-
pass needle pointed to the
magnetic north pole, then
naturally it would not nec-
essarily point true north.

What's more, if the mag-
netic pole were on the At-
lantic side of the
geographic north pole, then
one crossed the Atlantic

 

from east to west, the com-
pass needle would begin by

it did (see 1492, M
