Parachute

The principle of the para-
chute (a light object that
presents a large surface to
the air so that air resistance
slows its descent) was sim-

ple enough. The French
balloonist Jean-Pierre-
Francois Blanchard (1753—
1809) used one in 1785 to
drop a dog in a basket
safely to Earth from a bal-
loon. The first case of a

 

human being
chute successfully came in
1797 when another |
balloonist, Andr¢
Garnerin (1769—182:
managed it

Mass of the
Earth

Newton's equation for the
gravitational attraction of
one body to another (see
1687) contained symbols
for the gravitational con-
stant, the masses of the two
bodies, the distance be-
tween them, and the accel-
eration of movement
toward each other.

In the case of an object
falling to Earth, the mass of
the object, its distance from
Earth’s center, and its ac-
celeration were all known.

That left two unknowns,
the mass of the Earth and
the gravitational constant.
If one of these could

be determined, the other
could be calculated at
once.

The gravitational con-
stant was the same for all
objects. If the gravitational
attraction between two ob-
jects, each of known mass,
at a known distance from
each other, could be mea-
sured, that would allow the
gi'a\ilaliunzsl constant to be
calculated and, from that,
the mass of the Earth. How-
ever, two objects of known

mass were sure to be so
small that the gravitational
attraction between them
would be very tiny.
Nevertheless, Caven-
dish (see 1766) tried it in
1798. He suspended a light
rod by a wire attached to
its center. At each end of
the rod was a light lead
ball. The rod could twist
freely about the wire, and

 

 

 

even a small force applied
to the balls in opposite di-
rections would produce a
measurable twist. Caven-

 
 

dish measured h
twist was produced
