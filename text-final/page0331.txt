Diastase

A French chemist, Anselme
Payen (1795—1871), man-
aged a factory engaged in
the refining of sugar from
sugar beets. This turned his
attention to plant chemis-
try.

In 1833 he reported the
separation of a substance
from malt extract that had
the property of hastening
the conversion of starch to

glucose. Payen called the
substance diastase, from a
Greek word for “separate,”
for in a sense, it separated
the building blocks of
starch and produced the in-
dividual glucose units.
This was an example of
an organic catalyst. Yeast
is an organic catalyst that
was known even to prehis-
toric humanity, but yeast is
a living organism. Diastase
was the first organic cata-

lyst to be isolated from liv-
ing material that would
display catalytic activity
without being a living or-
ganism itself.

Diastase is an example
of what later came to be
called an enzyme, and it
was the first enzyme to be
prepared in concentrated
form. Because of it, the suf-
fix -ase eventually came to
be used in the names of en-
zymes generally.

 

 

 

Mechanical
Reaper

Agriculture had always
been a labor-intensive occu-
pation, particularly at har-
vest time, when there was
often a shortage of hands to
reap and gather the grain.
Attempts were there-

fore made to devise a me-
chanical reaper, and the
one that finally proved suc-
cessful was built by an
American inventor, Cyrus
Hall McCormick (1809—
1884). He first built what
came to be called the
McCormick reaper in 1831
and he secured a patent for
it in 1834.

It wasn't immediately
successful, but McCormick
pushed it with great perti-
nacity, and little by little, it
took hold, particularly in
the vast grain fields of the
American Midwest

This began a whole se-
ries of mechanical inven
tions that gradually
reduced the number of la-
