Austrian national, had to
flee the country because,
with its annexation by Ger-
many, it became subject to
Germany's anti-Semitic
laws. She escaped to Swe-
den.

Hahn, now working
with the German chemist
Fritz Strassman (1902—
1980), finally began to sus-
pect that the radioactivity
could not be separated
from the barium because it
consisted of a radioactive
isotope of that very ele-
ment. But how could a ra-
dioactive isotope of barium
have been formed in the
neutron bombardment of
uranium? The atomic num-
ber of barium is 56. For ura-
nium to form barium, the
uranium nucleus would
have to break in two (some-
thing that later came to be
called nuclear fission).

Nuclear fission was un-
heard of, and Hahn hesi-
tated to make such a
suggestion. He published
his findings in January
1939 but said nothing
about fission.

Meitner, in Sweden,
thinking about the matter,
also came to the conclusion
that uranium had under-
gone nuclear fission and
had produced a radioactive
isotope of barium, but she
decided to advance the pos-
sibility publicly. With the
help of her nephew, the

physicist Otto Robert
Frisch (1904-1979), she pre-
pared a paper dated Janu-
ary 26, 1939, and sent it to
the British scientific jour-
nal Nature.

Frisch was working for
Bohr (see 1913) and told
him of the contents of the
paper before it was pub-
lished. Bohr was going to
the United States to attend
a physics conference in
Washington, D.C., on Janu-
ary 26, 1939, and he spread
the word there, also before
the paper was published.

In the United States,
nuclear fission as a result of
the neutron bombardment
of uranium was quickly
confirmed. Bohr had sug-
gested that it was the rare
isotope, uranium-235, that
underwent fission, and that
was confirmed, too.

For his discovery of nu-
clear fission, Hahn was
awarded the Nobel Prize
for chemistry in 1944, but
it was not until 1946 that
he could accept it.

Nuclear Chain
Reaction

Chain reactions are famil-
iar in chemistry. A reaction
may produce heat, which en-
courages further reaction,
which produces more heat,
and so on. The manner in
which a lightning stroke, or
a single match, can burn

down an entire forest is an
example of a chemical
chain reaction. A chemical
reaction can also produce a
molecular product, which
brings about more of the
chemical reaction, which
produces more of the molec-
ular product, and so on.
The formation of polymers
is sometimes the result of
such a chain reaction.

As early as 1932, it had
occurred to the Hungarian-
born physicist Leo Szilard
(1898—1964) that a nuclear
chain reaction was also pos-
sible. By that time, atomic
nuclei were being bom-
barded by neutrons, and in
some cases, the entry of one
neutron into a nucleus
meant the ejection of two
neutrons. Szilard envisaged
the case of a neutron dis-
rupting a nucleus and pro-
ducing two neutrons, which
would disrupt two nuclei,
producing four neutrons,
which would disrupt four
nuclei, and so on. Each dis-
ruption would deliver a
tiny quantity of energy, but
each link in such a nuclear
chain reaction would pro-
ceed so quickly that the
energy produced would
mount in a fraction of a sec-
ond to titanic proportions.
The result would be a nu-
clear bomb, tremendously
more powerful than ordi-
nary bombs based on chem-
ical chain reactions.

Szilard was one of
