 

Tetraethyl Lead

One of the difficulties in au-
tomotive engineering was
that of getting the gasoline
vapors to burn smoothly
within the cylinder. If they
burned too rapidly, there
was too great an explosion
and a resulting “knock” in
the engine. This was hard
on the engine, disturbing to
the ear, and wasted energy.

In 1921, however, the
American chemist Thomas
Midgley, Jr. (1889-1944)
discovered that if the com-
pond tetraethyl lead was
added to the gasoline, it in-
hibited the burning just
enough to prevent knock. It
was an antiknock com-
pound. From that time on,
one could speak of “ethyl
gas” or of “leaded gaso-
line.”

A bromine compound
was also added to the gaso-
line, to prevent accumula-
tion of lead in the cylinder.
It meant that the relatively
volatile compound lead bro-

mide was formed and dis-
charged through the
exhaust. This added an-
other factor to the air
pollution produced by
automobiles.

Introvert and
Extrovert

Freud, who devised psycho-
analysis (see 1893 and 1900,
Dreams), had a number of
colleagues, with whom he
always managed to quarrel.
Those colleagues went on
to found psychoanalytic
schools of their own and to
add refinements to psycho-
analytic theory. Thus the
Austrian psychiatrist Alfred
Adler (1870-1937) had pop-
ularized the notion of the
inferiority complex in 1911.
In 1921 the Swiss psy-
chiatrist Carl Gustav Jung
(1875-1961) popularized
the concepts of introvert, for
a person whose thoughts
and interests are directed
inward, and extrovert, for a

person whose thoughts and
interests are concentrated
on other people and the out-
side world.

 

Rorschach Test

Psychoanalysis generally
involves conversation be-
tween the patient and the
psychiatrist, with the pa-
tient usually doing most of
the talking. In 1921, how-
ever, a Swiss psychiatrist,
Hermann Rorschach
(1884-1922), invented a
nonconversational device
for diagnosing psycho-
pathological conditions

This involved the use of
ten symmetrical inkblots,
which patients were asked
to interpret—to give their
notion of what the abstract
images represented. This
Rorschach test became well
known to the general pub-
lic, although as with psy-
choanalytic techniques
generally, it is difficult to
tell objectively how useful
itis.
