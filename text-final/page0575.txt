eclipses to study the corona
and its spectrum.

Schmidt
Camera

One of the difficulties with
the large telescopes of the
twentieth century was that
they could focus on such a
tiny part of the sky. It was
like looking at the Universe
through a keyhole. Any at-
tempt to enlarge the view
resulted in inadmissable
distortion.

In 1930 the Estonian-
born German optician
Bernhard Voldemar
Schmidt (1879-1935) de-
vised a special corrector
plate, a small glass object
with a complicated shape
that could be placed near
the focus of a spherical mir-
ror. The corrector plate
bent the light waves in such
a way as to eliminate distor-
tion, so that even wide
fields could be enlarged
steadily.

An instrument outfitted
with such a mirror and cor-
rector plate is called a
Schmidt telescope, or, since
it is invariably used with a
photographic plate rather

than an eye receiving the
light, a Schmidt camera.
Used in conjunction with a
conventional telescope, it
can locate the interesting
spots, on which the keen
peephole of the telescope
can then be focused.

Interstellar
Matter

Three centuries earlier, it
had come to be understood
that there was a vacuum be-
tween the astronomical
bodies. It was all too easy
then to assume that the vac-
uum was perfect; that there
was really nothing at all
once one got outside any at-
mosphere that might be
clinging to the immediate
surface of a body.

In 1930, however, the
Swiss-born American as-
tronomer Robert Julius
Trumpler (1886—1956)
noted that the light of the
more distant globular clus-
ters was dimmer than
would be expected from
their sizes. The more dis-
tant the cluster, the more
marked this departure from
the expected brightness.
What's more, the more dis-
tant the cluster, the redder
the light.

The easiest way of ex-
plaining this was to sup-
pose that space, even far
from sizable bodies, was
not a perfect vacuum. (In-

deed, a perfect vacuum
does not exist and probably
cannot exist in the Uni-
verse.) There are thin wisps
of gas and dust throughout
interstellar space, and over
vast distances, there is
enough of this—of dust,
particularly—to dim and
redden light. By taking the
dimming effect of this inter-
stellar matter into account,
the size of the Galaxy was
shown to be somewhat
smaller than Shapley's too-
large estimates (see 1918).

Antimatter

The demonstration by Da-
visson and Thomson that
electron waves really ex-
isted (see 1927) encouraged
the British physicist Paul
Adrien Maurice Dirac
(1902-1984) to develop the
mathematics of electron
waves.

From the equations he
derived, it seemed to him
that electrons and protons
(the only two subatomic
particles then known) had
to exist in two energy
states, one positive and one
negative. At first Dirac as-
sumed that the electron
and proton themselves rep-
resented the two energy
states and were fundamen-
tally the same particle.

That would have been
a great simplification of
subatomic physics, but it
didn't stand up. The proton
