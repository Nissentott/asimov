tances of the clusters them-
selves.

This task was under-
taken by the American as-
tronomer Harlow Shapley
(1885—-1972), making use of
the new 100-inch telescope
(see 1917). By 1918 he was
able to make a three-dimen-
sional model of the globu-
lar clusters and could see
that they themselves
formed a loose sphere
around a point in Sagitta-
rius far distant from the
Solar System.

Shapley assumed (cor-
rectly, as it turned out) that
the globular clusters were
distributed around the cen-
ter of the Galaxy. His esti-
mate of the distance to that
center was a trifle over-
large, something that was
later corrected. We now
know that the center of the
Galaxy is 30,000 light-years
away and that the Galaxy
is about 100,000 light-years
across. Our Solar System,
far from being at the center
of the Galaxy, is about
20,000 light-years from one
end and 80,000 from the
other. Shapley had de-
throned the Sun from its po-
sition at the center of the
Universe, as Copernicus
had dethroned the Earth
(see 1543).

We cannot see the cen-
ter of the Galaxy (let alone
the far half of the struc-
ture), because dark clouds
of dust and gas in the Milky

Way obscure the view. We
are, indeed, at the center of
what we can see—which is
not surprising.

With Shapley, astrono-
mers finally got a more or
less correct picture of the
size of the Galaxy and of our
own position in its outskirts.
1t was far larger than any-
one had thought—it con-
tained at least 100 billion
stars and perhaps twice
that number. It is not sur-
prising, then, that astrono-
mers thought our Galaxy
and its two attendant and
much smaller satellite galax-
ies, the Magellanic Clouds,
made up the Universe.

This seemed large
enough, but as it happened,
astronomers had not yet
even begun to grasp the
true size of the Universe.

Spectral Classes

Not all stellar spectra are
alike. Some resemble the
Sun's, but most stars have
spectra that are altogether
different. The first to point
this out was an Italian as-
tronomer, Pietro Angelo
Secchi (1818—1878), who in
1867 had divided stellar
spectra into four classes.
The notion of spectral
classes came of age, how-
ever, with the work of the
American astronomer
Annie Jump Cannon (1863—
1941) who in 1918 began
the meticulous and time-

consuming task of studying
and classifying the spectra
of many thousands of stars.

In so doing, she worked
up a classification that is
still used today. She used a
system of letters, planning
that there would be a
smooth transition from A to
B to C and so on. However,
as the stars were arranged
in order of decreasing sur-
face temperature, the let-
ters fell out of order, and
some had to be omitted.

The spectral classes of
the main sequence, in order
of decreasing temperature,
turned out tobe O, B, A, F,
G, K, and M.

Each spectral class can
be divided into ten subdivi-
sions from 0 to 9, so that
our Sun is a G2 star, Sirius
is Al, Rigel is BS, Arcturus
is K2, Betelgeuse is M2, and
Proxima Centauri M5. All
this turned out to be useful
in dealing with stellar evo-
lution.

Radioactive
Tracers

Fourteen years before,
Knoop had used benzene
rings as a tracer in fat me-
tabolism (see 1904). It oc-
curred to the Hungarian-
born chemist Georg Karl
von Hevesy (1885-1966)
that it might be possible to
use radioactive atoms as
tracers. The advantage
