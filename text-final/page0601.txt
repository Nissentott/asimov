toward the cathode, and
those with a negative
charge outweighing the pos-
itive charge will travel to-
ward the anode. The rate at
which a protein molecule
will travel in either direc-
tion depends on how great
the overall charge is and, to
some extent, on the pattern
of the charges over the mo-
lecular surface. Enough
variation exists so that
every protein molecule
travels at a different speed.
A technique that takes ad-
vantage of this to separate
and isolate protein compo-
nents of a mixture is called
electrophoresis.

A Swedish biochemist,
Arne Wilhelm Kaurin Tise-
lius (1902—-1971), developed
the technique in 1937. He
devised a special tube in
the form of a rectangular U
within which the proteins
could move and separate.
The Tiselius tube consisted
of portions fitted together
at specially ground joints,
which could be separated
to isolate one of a mixture
of proteins in a particular
chamber.

In addition, by the use
of proper cylindrical lenses,
it was possible to follow the
process of separation by ob-
serving changes in the re-
fraction of light passing
through the suspension.
These changes could be
photographed, and the re-

sulting wavelike pattern
could be used to calculate
the quantity of each protein
present in the mixture. Fail-
ure to separate a mixture
into components by electro-
phoresis was good evidence
of the purity of a protein
preparation, particularly if
there continued to be no
separation when the acidity
of the solution was changed.

For his work on electro-
phoresis, Tiselius was
awarded the Nobel Prize
for chemistry in 1948.

Electron
Microscopes

The first electron micro-
scope had been constructed
by Ruska (see 1932). It was
not till 1937, however, that
an electron microscope was
constructed that could
clearly outperform the best
optical microscopes. The
Canadian physicist James
Hillier (b. 1915) accom-
plished this feat. His micro-
scope could magnify seven
thousand times, whereas
the best optical microscope
could only manage a magni-
fication of two thousand
times.

Eventually, Hillier and
others devised electron mi-
croscopes with still further
capabilities, until magnifi-
cations of two million
times became possible.

Field-Emission
Microscope

A magnifying device even
more impressive than the
¢lectron microscope, al-
though of only limited use,
is the field-emission micro-
scope, first devised in 1937
by the German-born Ameri-
can physicist Erwin Wil-
helm Mueller (1911-1977).

This involves a very
fine needle tip in a high vac-
uum. The tip can be made
to emit electrons that shoot
outward in diverging
straight lines and strike a
fluorescent screen. What ap-
pears on the screen, then, is
a vastly magnified picture
of the needle tip.

Eventually, the image
of single atoms could be
made out.

Radio
Telescope

Radio waves from outer
space had been detected by
Jansky (see 1932), but noth-
ing had been done about it
because the devices neces-
sary for detecting and ana-
lyzing the radiation were
not yet in existence.

In 1937, however, an
American radio engineer,
Grote Reber (b. 1911), built
the first radio telescope in
his back yard. It was a para-
