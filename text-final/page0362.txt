Second law of
Thermodynamics

The first law of thermody-
namics (that is, the law of
conservation of energy—
see 1847) is an essentially
optimistic law. Since no en-
ergy can be destroyed, it
might seem that energy is
always there to be used
over and over.

Not all energy is
equally useful, however.
Carnot (see 1824) had
pointed out that in a steam
engine some of the energy
must be lost as heat and so
not all of it could be turned
into useful work.

The German physicist
Rudolf Julius Emanuel
Clausius (1822-1888) found
that this was true of any en-
ergy conversion: some en-
ergy was always lost as
heat, and heat could never
be converted completely to
any other form of energy.
As a result, the energy sup-
ply of the Universe was con-
stantly being degraded to
heat, and the amount of use-
ful energy was constantly
decreasing.

Clausius proposed that
if the ratio of the heat con-
tent of a system to its abso-
lute temperature were
taken, that ratio would al-
ways increase in any pro-
cess taking place in a
closed system. Under per-
fect conditions, it might re-
main constant, but it would
never decrease. Years later,
Clausius gave this ratio the
name of entropy for some
rather obscure reason.

Clausius had thus es-
tablished the second law of
thermodynamics, that the
amount of entropy in the
Universe always increases
and will some day reach a
maximum when no useful
energy is left and disorder
is total. That sounds pessi-
mistic, but since it will
probably take many tril-
lions of years to degrade all
the energy in the Universe,
it can’t be considered a mat-
ter of immediate concern.

Infrared Waves

The details of light, such as
the way it is refracted, the

spectrum it forms, and the
spectral lines it contains,

can all be studied easily be-
cause light can be seen—it
affects the retina. Infrared
radiation cannot be seen
and it is correspondingly
harder to study.

An Italian physicist,
Macedonio Melloni (1798—
1854), had invented a ther-
mopile, however, a series of
strips of two different met-
als that produced electric
currents when one end was
heated. Very weak electric
currents could be detected
and therefore so also could
very weak heating effects.

In 1850 Melloni put his
thermopile to work on the
infrared radiation that Her-
schel had discovered (see
1800). He could detect the
infrared radiation by its
heating effects as delicately
as the eye could detect ordi-
nary light. Melloni was
able to show that infrared
radiation exhibited all the
properties of ordinary light,
including polarization and
interference, so that there
was no question it con-
sisted of waves just like
those of light but longer—
too long to affect the
retina.
