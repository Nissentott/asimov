Geometry

Geometry, as a practical
study, may have begun in
Egypt, where the building
of pyramids and the neces-
sity of reestablishing
boundaries after the Nile
flood made it essential. The
Greeks made it theoretical,
however, working with
ideal points, lines, curves,
planes, and solids. They at-
tempted to prove things by
reason alone and without
actual measurement. (Rea-
son was the mark of the phi-
losopher; measurement was
only for the artisan, and the
Greek scholars were snobs.
Snobbery turned out to be
useful in mathematics,
though not in experimental
science, where the Greeks
fell badly short.)

A number of Greek
mathematicians contrib-
uted to the development of
geometry, particularly Eu-
doxus (see 350 B.c., Star
Maps). It was Euclid (fl. ea.
300 B.c.) who brought geom-
etry to maturity, however.
He worked in Alexandria,
Egypt, and thereby hangs a
tale.

The city of Alexandria,
on the seacoast at the west-
ernmost branch of the Nile
delta, had been founded by

Alexander III (see 320 B.c.)
and named after himself. It
was a largely Greek city,
though it contained many
Egyptians and Jews as
well. It quickly became the
largest and most cosmopoli-
tan city of the Greek world.
Ptolemy I (ca. 366—ca. 283
B.c.), who ruled over Egypt
after Alexander’s death, es-
tablished his capital at Al-
exandria.

Ptolemy I saw himself
as a patron of the arts and
sciences and founded the
Museum, so-called because
it was an institution de-
voted to the Muses, the pa-
tron goddesses of learning.
He and his son, Ptolemy II
(308-246 B.c.), made the
Museum the largest and
most important of all the
ancient universities. Associ-
ated with it was the largest
of all the ancient libraries.

The Prolemies encour-
aged scientists and thinkers
generally to come to Alex-
andria and subsidized them
well. Euclid, a Greek math-
ematician who may have
studied at the Academy,
moved from Athens to Alex-
andria as a result, symboliz-
ing the "brain drain’ that
followed, as Greeks poured
out of Greece proper into
the new dominions of the

Hellenistic kingdoms that
succeeded Alexandria.

Perhaps about 300 B.c.,
Euclid began compiling all
the geometrical [indings of
earlier mathematicians
into a textbook eventually
called Elements. He added
comparatively little him-
self, but what he did was be-
yond price.

He began with a mini-
mum number of statements
that were so self-cvident
that they required no proof.
From these axioms, he pro-
ceeded systematically to
prove theorem after theo-
rem, each prool depending
only on the axioms and on
previous proofs, so that ge-
ometry was given a firm
foundation and structure.

It was the most suceess-
ful textbook ever written
and has been used, in more
or less modified form, to
this day.

Tides

The Greeks were not quite
the sea-voyagers the Phoe-
nicians had been, though
by this time they could fol-
low the Phoenicians’ path
and sail all over the Medi-
terranean. Only one Greek,
Pytheas ({1. 300 B.c.). fol-
lowed the Phoenicians out
