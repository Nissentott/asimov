bonds of a particular car-
bon atom, two distinct mol-
ecules could be formed, one
being the mirror image of
the other.

If one of these com-
pounds twisted the plane of
polarization clockwise, the
other would twist it coun-
terclockwise. Indeed, any
compound shown by the
tetrahedral carbon atom to
be asymmetric was in fact
optically active when
tested, twisting the plane of
polarized light in one direc-
tion or the other. Any com-
pound not shown to be
asymmetric was not.

The way the tetrahe-
dral carbon atom explained
optical activity was so use-
ful that the new outlook
was adopted quickly. Van't
Hoft’s way of looking at for-
mulas was considered ste-
reochemistry, from the
Greek meaning “solid
chemistry,” since the mole-
cules were pictured in three
dimensions.

A French chemist, Jos-
eph-Achille Le Bel (1847—
1930), advanced the tetra-
hedral carbon atom at
about the same time, inde-
pendently.

Transfinite
Numbers

The notion of infinity, of
endlessness, is always trou-
blesome. The number series
1,2,3,4...isendless, but
so is the series 2,4,6,8. . ..
You can match up every
even number to an ordi-
nary number half its size so
that the total number of
even numbers is just as
great as the total number of
all numbers. (This had been
pointed out by Galileo two
and a half centuries before.)

The German mathema-
tician Georg Ferdinand
Ludwig Philipp Cantor
(1845-1918) used this sort
of one-to-one correspon-
dence to show that all frac-
tions are denumerable and
can be counted by the inte-
gers.

However, all real num-
bers (rational plus irratio-
nal) cannot be counted by
the integers. Whatever sys
tem one uses to count them
will always leave out an in-
finite number. The group of
real numbers represents a
higher infinity, a transfinite
number. Furthermore, all
real numbers correspond to

  

 

the points in a line, so that
points are also nondenunier-
able.

Cantor showed that
transfinite numbers them-
selves exist in an endless
number, which is larger
than the ordinary infinity
of the integers.

Current and
Crystals

Every once in a while a sci-
entist will note something
that might come under the
heading of “curious-but-so-
what?”

Thus, in 1874, a Ger-
man physicist, Karl Ferdi-
nand Braun (1850—1918),
noted that in the case of
some crystals, an electric
current would pass through
in one direction but not in
the other. He didn’t know
the reason for it, or what
could be done with it, but
as it turned out, it was an
enormously important
finding leading to amazing
consequences in later years.
