Jakob Berzelius (1779—

they named after the newly
discovered asteroid Ceres.

Smithson Tennant (1761—
1815), who had worked
with Wollaston (see 1800)
and was therefore inter-
ested in platinumlike ele-
ments, discovered two of
them in 1803. One he
named osmium, from the

Greek word for “smell,” be-
cause of the stench of one of
its compounds, and the
other iridium, from the
Greek word for “rainbow,”
because of the different col-
ors of its compounds.

 

 

Scientific
Ballooning

The first important use of
balloons for scientific re-
search came in 1804, when
Biot (see 1803) and Joseph
Louis Gay-Lussac (1778-
1850) made a balloon ascen-
sion that reached a height
of 4 miles, higher than any
peak in the Alps. They took
the opportunity to test the

composition of the air at
that height and also to
study the nature of Earth'’s
magnetic field. They found
no change in either com-
pared with measurements
at sea level.

This was the beginning
of high-altitude investiga-
tions that were to carry
human beings beyond
the atmosphere altogether
a century and a half
later.

 

Steam
Locomotive

If steam can turn paddle
wheels in the water, it can
also turn wheels on land, so
that one can imagine a
steam locomotive (from
Latin words meaning “‘mov-
ing from place to place”).
To be sure, such a steam-
powered land vehicle
would lose too much en-
