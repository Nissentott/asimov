Chlorine

Davy (see 1800) had worked
with hydrochloric acid (a
strong acid) and showed
that it contained no oxy-
gen, This was the final blow
to the assumption that oxy-
gen was essential to acids.
However, hydrochloric acid
did contain chlorine, and
Scheele (see 1774) had
thought chlorine to be an
oxygen-containing com-
pound. In 1810 Davy
showed this was not so, and
that chlorine was an ele-
ment. For this reason he
rather than Scheele usually
receives credit for the dis-
covery of chlorine.
