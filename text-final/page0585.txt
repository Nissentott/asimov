devised the first particle ac-
celerator (see 1929), used
protons from such an accel-
erator to bombard lithium
nuclei. This made alpha
particles come streaking
out of the lithium nuclei.

The lithium nucleus is
made up of three protons
and four neutrons. When ac-
celerated protons are fired
at such a nuclei, a proton
will occasionally enter a nu-
cleus, giving it four protons
and four neutrons. This in-
stantly breaks up into two
alpha particles containing
two protons plus two neu-
trons. In other words: hy-
drogen + lithium yields
helium + helium.

This was the first nu-
clear reaction produced by
human beings as a result of
bombardment with artifi-
cially accelerated particles.
It was to be the first of
many.

Radio Waves
from Space

As radio came more promi-
nently into use for commu-
nication and home
entertainment, the problem
of static (a crackling inter-
ference that made commu-
nication uncertain and
music unpleasant) cried out
for correction. Static had a
number of causes, includ-

ing thunderstorms, nearby
electric equipment, and air-
craft passing overhead.

The Bell Telephone
Company, which needed
radio for ship-to-shore
calls, among other things,
set one of its employees,
Karl Guthe Jansky (1905—
1950), to exploring the
problem.

Jansky detected a new
kind of weak static from a
source that at first he could
not identify. [t came from
overhead and moved stead-
ily. At first it seemed to Jan-
sky that it must be the Sun,
However, the source gained
slightly on the Sun to the
extent of 4 minutes a day.
This is just the amount by
which the vault of the stars
gains on the Sun, so that
the source must lie beyond
the Solar System.

By the spring of 1932,
Jansky had decided that
the source was in the con-
stellation of Sagittarius,
the direction in which
Shapley had placed the cen-
ter of our galaxy (see 1918).

This represented the
birth of radio astronomy, in
which astronomers learned
to receive and interpret
radio waves rather than
light waves.

Light waves, of course,
are easily perceived by the
retina of the eye and by pho-
tographic film. In 1932,
however, perceiving radio

L e

waves with any precision
was extremely difficult, for
instruments were lacking.
Therefore, the development
of radio astronomy was de-
layed for some twenty years.

Electron
Microscope

Davisson had demonstrated
that electrons did indeed
have their wave aspects
(see 1927). Therefore they
might be manipulated in
much the same way that
light waves were. They
might be focused as light
waves were in microscopes,
for instance.

The sharpness with
which tiny objects can be
seen varies inversely with
the wavelength of the view-
ing medium. The shorter
the wavelength, the smaller
the objects that can be
made out. Since electron
waves have a wavelength
equal to that of X rays (but
are much easier to focus
than X rays), an electron nii-
croscope should be much
more powerful than an ordi-
nary optical microscope.

Electron waves cannot
be focused by passing them
through lenses, of course,
but they can be focused by
appropriate magnetic
fields. The German electri-
cal engineer Ernst August
Friedrich Ruska (1906—
