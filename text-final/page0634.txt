Pion

Yukawa had predicted the
existence of a particle with
mass between that of an
electron and a proton. It
would serve as an exchange
particle, holding together
the protons and neutrons
within the nucleus despite
the electromagnetic repul-
sion among the protons (see
1935, Strong Interaction).
Anderson detected a parti-
cle of intermediate mass,
the muon (see 1937), but it
lacked the necessary prop-
erties to fulfill the role Yu-
kawa had laid out for it.

Meanwhile, the English
physicist Cecil Frank Pow-
ell (1903-1969) had worked
out a new method of parti-
cle detection. Instead of
having particles strike a
cloud chamber and then
photographing the results,
he had the particles strike a
photographic emulsion so
that the result could be re-
corded directly.

In 1947 he exposed pho-
tographic plates in the Bo-
livian Andes and picked up
evidence of a particle of in-
termediate mass that was
not the one Anderson had
discovered. Powell named
it the pi-meson, which was

eventually shortened to
pion.

Whereas Anderson’s
muon had all the properties
of an electron except for its
greater mass, so that it was
a lepton, the pion shared
certain properties with the
more massive particles and
was lumped with them as a
hadron. The pion interacted
readily with protons and
neutrons (as the muon did
not) and had all the proper-
ties required for it to be Yu-
kawa's predicted particle.

For this work, Powell
was awarded the Nobel
Prize for physics in 1950.

Carbon-14
Dating

Seven years before, Martin
David Kamen had discov-
ered carbon-14 and found it
to have a surprisingly long
half-life, some 5,700 years.
In 1947 the American chem-
ist Willard Frank Libby
(1908—1980) put the isotope
to important use.

It had turned out that
cosmic ray bombardment
converted some of the nitro-
gen-14 of the atmosphere
into carbon-14. New car-
bon-14 was formed as old

carbon-14 broke down ra-
dioactively, so that an equi-
librium was achieved. A
given very small quantity
of it always remained in
the Earth’s atmosphere.

Libby reasoned that
plants absorbed carbon di-
oxide in the course of photo-
synthesis, so that carbon
atoms from the gas found
their way into the mole-
cules of plant tissues. This
must include a very small
quantity of carbon-14, since
it was always present in at-
mospheric carbon dioxide.
Despite the fact that this
carbon-14 was present in
terribly small amounts, its
concentration could be de-
termined because the beta
particles it liberated could
be detected with great pre-
cision.

Once a plant died, how-
ever, no further carbon-14
would be absorbed, so that
what carbon-14 it con-
tained would slowly break
down without being re-
placed. By determining the
concentration of carbon-14
in the remains of a once-liv-
ing plant, the amount of
time that had elapsed since
the organism had died
could be determined with
surprising accuracy.
