Nuclear Fusion
Bomb

The American effort to pro-
duce a nuclear fusion bomb
(hydrogen bomb) was soon
successful. Hydrogen-2
fused at a lower tempera-
ture than hydrogen-1, and
hydrogen-3 fused at a lower
temperature still. Hydro-
gen-2 was a rare isotope of
hydrogen, but there was
enough present in the
Earth's oceans to last hu-
manity for billions of years.
Hydrogen-3 was radiocac-
tive and had to be formed
through nuclear reactions if
enough was to be obtained
for use. It was planned to
fuse a mixture of hydrogen-
2 and hydrogen-3 in liquid
form by exposure to the
temperatures and pressures
produced by a fission
bomb.

Such a fusion bomb
was tested on a coral atoll
in the Pacific Ocean on No-
vember 1, 1952, wiping out
the atoll. The blast vielded
energy equivalent to
10,000,000 tons (10 mega-
tons) of TNTâ€”five hundred
times the 20-kiloton energy
of the Hiroshima bomb.

Yet it did not give the
United States security.

Within a year, the Soviets
had exploded a fusion
bomb of their own. Both
sides continually improved
the efficiency and power of
their fusion weapons, and
Great Britain and China
also acquired the technol-
ogy. As Oppenheimer had
foreseen (see 1951), the
world descended further
into the abyss of fear, from
which it has not vet
emerged.

Einsteinium and
Fermium

Seaborg (see 1940 and
1944) and his team contin-
ued to make ever more com-
plex atoms, and as the
atoms were made, they
were bombarded with
small atomic nuclei. Some
of these stuck to the com-
plex nucleus of the atoms
being bombarded so that
still newer and more com-
plex atoms were formed.
In 1952, however, com-
plex atoms were formed in
a different way. The raven-
ing energies of the fusion
bomb explosion in the Pa-
cific (see above) had driven
nuclei together and formed
atoms even more complex
than californium (element

number 98), which was at
the time the most complex
known (see 1949). As a re-
sult, elements 99 and 100
were formed and detected.
They were eventually
named, respectively, einstei-
nium and fermium in honor
of Albert Einstein and En-
rico Fermi, who had died in
the months preceding labo-
ratory study of the ele-
ments.

Kaons and
Hyperons

Pions had been discovered
by Powell (see 1947), and
since that was the interme-
diate-sized particle that
Yukawa had predicted (see
1935, Strong Interaction),
there seemed no reason to
expect anything more,

In 1952, however, two
Polish physicists, Marian
Danysz and Jerzy Pniewski,
discovered another inter-
mediate-sized particle. It
was about 3.5 times as mas-
sive as a pion but still only
half as massive as a proton
or neutron and was called a
K-meson, which was some-
times abbreviated to kaon.

These same physicists
went on that year to dis-
cover, among the products
