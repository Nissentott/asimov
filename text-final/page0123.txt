Heliocentric
System

The speculations of Aris-
tarchus (see 280 B.c.), about
a heliocentric system in
which the Sun was at the
center of the Universe, with
the planets, including the
Earth, revolving about it,
had been disregarded, and
the geocentric system of
Hipparchus (see 150 B.c.)
and Ptolemy (see 140) had
been accepted without
question.

However, the mathe-
matics needed to work out
the planetary motions on a
geocentric basis was very
difficult. While the Sun and
Moon moved steadily west-
to-east against the stars,
the other planets occasion-
ally reversed direction (ret-
rograde motion) and grew
markedly brighter and dim-
mer as they progressed
across the sky.

The Polish astronomer
Nicolaus Copernicus (1473—
1543) thought, as early as
1507, that if one went back
to Aristarchus’s view and
supposed that all the plan-
ets, including Earth, were
moving about the Sun, it
would become easy to ex-
plain retrograde motion. [t
would also be easy to ex-

plain why Venus and Mer-
cury always remained near
the Sun and why planets
grew dimmer and brighter.
In addition to all this, the
mathematics for working
out planetary motions and
positions would be simpli-
fied.

Copernicus did not, in
his suggestions, abandon
all Greek ideas. He clung to
the notion that planets had
to move in orbits that were
circles and combinations of
circles, and in this way he
retained much unnecessary
complexity.

The difference between
Aristarchus and Copernicus
was that Aristarchus
merely presented his notion
as a logical way of looking
at the planets. Since others
thought it wasn't logical,
that ended it. Copernicus,
however, used the Aris-
tarchean idea to work out
the actual mathematics of
the planetary motions and
show the reduction in com-
plexity. This meant that
even if people denied that
the heliocentric system
could be true, they would
still be apt to use it as a sim-
plified device for calcula-
tions,

Nevertheless, Coperni-
cus hesitated to publish his
theory and his computa-

tions, because he knew that
the geocentric theory was
felt by the Church to be in
accordance with the Bible.
To advance a heliocentric
theory that would seem to
be going against the Bible
would surely create a
storm. He therefore quietly
circulated his book only in
manuscript form.

Finally he let himself
be persuaded by enthusias-
tic friends to have the book
printed. It was entitled De
Revolutionibus Orbitm
Coelestium (Concerning the
Revolution of Heavenly Bod-
tes). He dedicated it to Pope
Paul II1 (1468—1549) as a
placatory gesture, and then
died. The story is that Co-
pernicus was given the very
first copy ol his book on the
day of his death.

As Copernicus had for-
seen, the book created a
loud and violent storm. The
Catholic Church put the
book on its Index, forbid-
ding the faithful 1o read it,
and did not lift the ban till
1835. The Lutherans were
equally hostile. The book
could not be suppressed,
however. With the coming
of printing, far too many
copies (looded the libraries
of the scholars.
