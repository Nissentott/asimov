Avogadro’s
Hypothesis

It was clear that all gases
expanded by the same
amount as temperature
rose, provided the pressure
remained constant. In 1811
an Italian physicist,
Amedeo Avogadro (1776—
1856), suggested that this
might mean that all gases
—at the same volume, pres-
sure, and temperature—
were made up of the same
number of particles. This
came to be called Avo-
gadro's hypothesis.

If this is so, since water
upon being broken up by an
electric current decom-
poses into hydrogen and ox-
ygen, with hydrogen having
twice the volume of oxygen,
then twice as many parti-
cles of hydrogen must be
formed as of oxygen. This
in turn makes it appear
that water particles are not
made up of one hydrogen
atom and one oxygen atom,
as Dalton had thought, but
may be made up, at the sim-

 

 

plest, of two hydrogen
atoms and one oxygen
atom.

In that case, since the
oxygen in water has eight
times the mass of the hydro-
gen, the oxygen atom must
be eight times as massive
as the two hydrogen atoms
put together, or sixteen
times as massive as a single
hydrogen atom.

Again, if all gases at a
given temperature, pres-
sure, and volume are made
up of the same number of
particles, and if the density
of one gas is twice that of
another, the mass of each
particle in the first gas is
twice that of the other.

Thus, the density of
water vapor is nine times
that of hydrogen at the
same temperature, but
since the oxygen atom has
sixteen times the mass of
the hydrogen atom, then
the weight of the water par-
ticleis 16 + 1 + 1, or 18.
Why isn't the density of the
water vapor eighteen times
that of the hydrogen? It
may be because the hydro-

gen particles are made up,
not of single hydrogen
atoms, but of combinations
of two hydrogen atoms. In
similar fashion, Avogadro
argued that oxygen and ni-
trogen particles were made
up of two atoms each.

Avogadro distinguished
between single atoms and
these combinations of
atoms that made up the
particles of compounds.
The combinations of atoms
he called molecules (from
Latin words for “small
masses”). Thus, there was
an oxygen atom, and there
was also an oxygen mole-
cule made up of two oxygen
atoms. There was a water
molecule made up of one
oxygen atom and two
hydrogen atoms. And
S0 on.

Avogadro’s hypothesis,
if fully applied, would ex-
plain a great deal about
atomic weights and about
the atomic consitution of
compounds. Unfortu-
nately, the hypothesis was
largely ignored for half a
century, and chemists re-
