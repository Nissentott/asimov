target, of course, but the
Portuguese experts thought
the Earth was larger than
Columbus’s figure (the Por-
tuguese were right) and
were convineed it would
not be long before they cir-
cumnavigated Africa and
reached their goal.

Columbus tried else-
where without luck and
was almost on the point of
giving up when things
turned out well for him in
Spain.

With Ferdinand and Is-
abella ruling jointly over a
united Spain, the nation
could assault the last scrap
of Muslim rule. This was
the nation of Granada in
the far south of Spain. The
joint monarchs prosecuted
a vigorous war against Gra-
nada and on January 2,
1492, it fell. What's more,
Torquemada engineered
the expulsion of the Jews
from Spain in 1492. (This
was not a new phenome-
non, for the Jews had ear-
lier been expelled from
England and France. They
found a refuge in Poland,
which needed a merchant
class, and in the Muslim
world, which was more tol-
erant than the Christians,
because for one thing, they
were at the time more civi-
lized.)

The Spanish monarchs,
feeling Spain to be united
and strong, decided to give
Columbus a minimum of

financial backing. With
three old ships and a crew
of prisoners released from
jail for the purpose, he set
forth on August 3, 1492. For
seven weeks he sailed west-
ward, encountering no land
but also encountering no
storms. Finally on October
12, he sighted land—an is-
land, as it turned out, in
the Bahamas.

He sailed southward
and encountered islands of
the West Indies. (To his
dying day, Columbus was
convinced he had reached
the Indies; that is, the east-
ern coast of Asia. The name
of the West Indies and the
habit of calling Native
Americans Indians are the
result of that delusion.)

It was not Asia, of
course, that he had come
upon, but the American
continents, a New World,
and the Old World would
never be the same again.

Columbus was not, of
course, the first human
being to set foot on these
continents. Siberian na-
tives had done so at least
thirty thousand years ear-
lier (see 20,000 B.c.). He was
not even the first European
to do so, for Leif Eriksson
had done it five centuries
before (see 1000). Colum-
bus’s feat, however, led al-
most at once to the
beginning of permanent Eu-
ropean settlements on the
new continents, and that

marked their entry into the
common current of world
history. It is for this reason
that Columbus is generally
given credit for the “discov-
ery.”

Incidentally, the fact
that new continents existed
that were wholly unknown
to the ancients helped elim-
inate the notion that the an-
cient thinkers had known
everything and had solved
all problems. Europeans
gained the heady feeling
that they now moved be-
yond the ancients, and that
helped make possible the
Scientific Revolution that
was to start in half a cen-
tury.

Magnetic
Declination

The magnetic compass,
which made a voyage like
Columbus’s possible, natu-
rally focused considerable
attention on the phenome-
non of magnetism. No one
knew at this time why the
needle pointed north, but
people took it for granted
that whatever the reason,
the needle pointed north
steadily and without
change.

The person who found
out differently was Colum-
bus himself. As he sailed
westward, he couldn’t help
but notice that the mag-
netic needle changed some-
