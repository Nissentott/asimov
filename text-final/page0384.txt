Germ Theory of
Disease

More and more biologists
were coming to suspect
that contagious diseases
were caused by microorgan-
isms,

In 1862 Pasteur (see
1846) took up the matter
and issued a publication
that gathered all the evi-
dence. His prestige was
such that the germ theory of
disease then had to be taken
seriously. There is no ques-
tion but that this was the
most important single ad-

vance in the history of med-
icine.

Using the theory,
Pasteur, and others as well,
located the specific micro-
organisms that caused cer-
tain diseases and could
then work out logical ways
of preventing the disease in
the first place or of curing it
once it struck.

This was the beginning
of modern medicine. It led
to a fall in the death rate, a
doubling in life expectancy,
and an accelerated popula-
tion explosion that has
more than tripled world
population since Pasteur’s

time and presented human-
ity with enormous prob-
lems in consequence.

Companion of
Sirius
Bessel had suggested the ex-
istence of a dark compan-
ion of Sirius, one that could
not be seen but that be-
trayed its existence by its
gravitational influence (see
1844).
