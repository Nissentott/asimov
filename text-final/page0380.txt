Spontaneous
Generation

Pasteur (see 1846) now took
up the matter of spontane-
ous generation. It was al-
ready clear that nutrient
broth that had been
strongly heated till all mi-
croorganisms within it
were dead would not de-
velop microorganisms if it
were sealed away from air.
Vitalists, however, main-
tained that the heating de-
stroyed some vital principle
in the air.

Pasteur had shown that

dust in the air carried mi-
croorganisms. In 1860, he
therefore boiled meat ex-
tract and then left it in a
flask exposed to air, but
only by way of a long nar-
row neck that was bent
down, then up. Although
unheated air could thus
freely penetrate into the
flask, dust particles settled
to the bottom of the curved
neck and did not enter the
flask. The meat extract did
not spoil. No decay took
place. No organisms devel-
oped. There was no ques-
tion now of a destroyed
vital principle. When

Pasteur knocked the neck
off the flask, microorgan-
isms developed in the meat
extract at once.

That was the final de-
struction of the notion of
spontaneous generation—
at least under present con-
ditions.

Darwin’s theory of evo-
lution, however, had
opened the question as re-
gards the past. If species
had evolved, might there
not have been a time when
life itself evolved from non-
living precursors? This was
a most uneasy thought to
those who had always as-
