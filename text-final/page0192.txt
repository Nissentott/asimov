imaginary. You can then
say that +i X +i= —1.
What's more, —i X ~i
= —1.

Wallis (see 1668) suc-
ceeded in making sense out
of such imaginary numbers
in 1685.

Imagine a horizontal
line. Mark off a point as
zero and then imagine the
positive numbers marked
off to the right and the nega-
tive numbers marked off to
the left, with all the frac-
tions and irrational num-

bers appropriately marked
off between the whole num-
bers. That is the real num-
ber axis.

Next, draw a vertical
line passing through the
zero point. Mark all the i
numbers (i, 2i, 3i, and so
on) upward, and all the —i
numbers downward, with
all the imaginary fractions
and irrational numbers
marked off, too. That is the
imaginary number axis.

Every point in the
plane can then be marked

off just as Descartes did in
his analytical geometry (see
1637). Every point (a) on
the real number axis be-
comes a + 0i; every point
(b) on the imaginary num-
ber axis becomes 0 + bi;
and every number on nei-
ther axis (the complex num-
bers) becomes a + bi.

Such a scheme proved
enormously useful to math-
ematicians, scientists, and
engineers.

Meteorological
Map

The wind often seems to be
totally unruly and unpre-
dictable, but even the an-
cient Romans knew that it
blew from Africa to India
for six months and then in
the other direction for six
months. These seasonal
winds were called mon-

soons, from an Arabic word
meaning ‘‘season.” There
were also the steady trade
winds that blew southwest-
ward north of the equator
and northwestward south
of the equator.

The first person to try
to make world sense out of
the winds was Halley (see
1678), who in 1686 wrote a
book on the subject. It in-
cluded a world map that

showed the prevailing
winds over the tropic
oceans—the monsoons and
trade winds. Halley did not
have quite the proper expla-
nation for the winds, how-
ever. He knew they
involved the rising of sun-
heated air but did not un-
derstand the reason for the
westward flow of tropical
air.
