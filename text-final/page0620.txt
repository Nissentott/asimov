1942

 

Nuclear Reactor

Szilard's notion of a nu-
clear chain reaction (see
1939) could not be made
practical. Once the Manhat-
tan Project had been put in
motion (see 1941), Fermi
was placed in charge of pro-
ducing such a chain reac-
tion. Uranium and uranium
oxide were piled up in com-
bination with graphite
blocks in a structure called
an atomic pile. Neutrons
colliding with the carbon
atoms in graphite did not
affect the carbon nuclei but
bounced off, giving up their
energy and moving more
slowly as a result, thus in-
creasing their chance of re-
acting with uranium-235.
Making the pile as
large as possible made it
more likely that neutrons
would strike uranium-235
before blundering out of
the pile altogether and into
the open air. The necessary
size was the critical mass.
Naturally, the more en-
riched in uranium-235 the
pile was, the smaller the
critical mass needed to be.

Cadmium rods were in-
serted into the pile, because
cadmium would soak up
neutrons and keep the pile
from becoming active pre-
maturely. When the pile
was large enough, the cad-
mium rods were slowly
withdrawn and the number
of neutrons produced
slowly increased. At some
point, the increase would
reach the level where more
were being produced than
were being harmlessly con-
sumed by the cadmium. At
that time the nuclear chain
reaction would begin and
the whole thing would go
out of control in a moment

What stopped that
from happening was that
some neutrons didn't come
out of the bombarded nu-
clei at once. In other words,
after the pile went critical,
there was a slight pause be-
fore the delayed neutrons
were emitted and every-
thing went awry. During
that pause, the cadmium
rods could be shoved in
again.

At 3:45 p.m. on Decem-
ber 2, 1942, in the squash

court of the University of
Chicago, the chain reaction
became self-sustaining and
was choked off. The atomic
age had begun. The atomic
pile was the first nuclear re-
actor.

Biotin

At this time a new vitamin
could only be detected by
noting that certain foods or
food extracts could correct
symptoms that known vita-
mins would not touch. One
such new vitamin was
called vitamin H. The Amer-
ican biochemist Vincent du
Vigneaud (1901-1978) iso-
lated tiny quantities of vita-
min H in reasonably pure
form, as judged by its pow-
erful effect on the symp-
toms it could alleviate, and
by 1942 had worked out its
rather complicated two-
ring structure. The com-
pound was now called bio-
tin. It was synthesized and
its structure proven.
