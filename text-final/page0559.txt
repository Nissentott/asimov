exactly where they wanted
to and building up mole-
cules of intricate form. The
alkaloids present in plant
tissues (see 1805) were
particularly complex for
compounds that were

not simply chains of
simple and repeated

units.

An English chemist,
Robert Robinson (1886—
1975), was particularly
skillful at synthesizing com-
plex molecules, and in 1925
he synthesized morphine.
From the methods of the
synthesis, he could deduce
its exact structure, atom for
atom.

For his work in this
field, Robinson was
awarded the Nobel
Prize for chemistry in
1947,

Parathormone

The thyroid gland was
known to produce a hor-
mone that regulated meta-
bolic activity (see 1915).
Embedded within it were
four small glands called the
parathyroids, which regu-
lated calcium metabolism.
In 1925 the Canadian bio-
chemist James Bertram
Collip (1892—-1965) isolated
from the parathyroids an
extract that contained the
hormone, which was
named parathormone.

Iron and
Cytochrome

Keilin had earlier demon-
strated the existence of cy-
tochromes within the cell—

a series of enzymes that
combined oxygen atoms
with pairs of hydrogen
atoms (see 1924).

A German biochemist,
Otto Heinrich Warburg
(1883—1970), was studying
the cytochromes and no-
ticed that carbon monoxide
attached itself to them in
the same way that they
attached themselves to he-
moglobin. In 1925 Warburg
showed that the cyto-
chromes possessed the
same iron-containing heme
group that hemoglobin did
