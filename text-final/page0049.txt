Advanced
Schools

The Greek philosopher
Plato (ca. 428—ca. 348 or
347 B.c.) founded a school
in the western suburbs of
Athens in 387 B.c. Intended
for advanced study, it
might be called the world's
first university. Because it
was on the grounds that
had once belonged to a leg-
endary Greek named Acade-

mus, it came to be called
the Academy.

Plato’s pupil Aristotle
(384—-322 B.c.) founded a
school of his own in Athens
in 335 B.c. It was called the
Lyeceum, because the build
ing it occupied had been
dedicated to Apollo Lyceus,
god of shepherds. Aris
totle’s lectures at the school
were collected into nearly a
hundred and fifty volumes,
