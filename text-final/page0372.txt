great deal of carbon in it
(from the charcoal or coke
used to smeltit). This cast
iron was hard but brittle.
The carbon could be re-
moved and pure iron
(wrought iron) left behind.
This was tough but too soft.
Then finally, just the right
amount of carbon could be
added to form steel, which
was both tough and hard.
By then, steel was expen-
sive.

The British metallur-
gist Henry Bessemer (1813â€”
1898) sought a way of re-
moving the carbon from
cast iron more cheaply. In
the old way, the carbon was
burned off by oxygen from
additional iron ore while
the mixture was strongly
heated. Bessemer wondered
if the oxygen could not be
supplied more simply by
sending a blast of air
through the molten iron. It
might seem that the blast
would cool the iron and
spoil everything, but the
combination of oxygen
from the air and carbon in
the iron actually heated the
mix. By stopping the pro-
cess at the point where the
carbon level was right, Bes-
semer got his steel directly.

In 1856 Bessemer an-
nounced his discovery, and
such blast furnaces began to
be built. It took a while for
the method to be perfected
because it required phos-
phorus-free iron ore,

something the steel
manufacturers didn't un-
derstand. Eventually, how-
ever, the bugs were worked
out and the era of cheap
steel began. Steel, together
with elevators (see 1852),
helped build the cities of
the next century.

Synthetic Dyes

Although human beings
have a liking for color in
their clothes, natural fibers
such as cotton, linen, and
wool tend to be white or
off-white, and the colored
dyes available to ancients
tended to bleach in sun-
light and wash out in
water. To be sure, a few
dyes were available that
did neither. One was Tyrian
purple, obtained from a
snail in the harbor of Tyre,
a dye so expensive it was re-
served in late Roman times
for royalty. There were also
cochineal, from an insect,
and indigo and alizarin
from plants.

In 1856 a young British
chemistry student, William
Henry Perkin (1838-1907),
was trying to synthesize
quinine, the antimalarial
drug. He was doomed to
failure, for the molecular
structure of quinine was far
too complex for the syn-
thetic methods of the time
to handle.

In the mess that re-
sulted, however, Perkin

thought he saw a purplish
glint. He added alcohol,
which dissolved a sub-
stance that turned the solu-
tion a beautiful mauve (as
the color was eventually
named). Perkin wondered if
it could be used as a dye.
He had it checked and de-
cided it could. He left
school, invested the family
savings in a factory to man-
ufacture the dye, and the
project proved most suc-
cessful.

Other chemists quickly
entered the field of syn-
thetic dyes and the world of
fashion became the rain-
bow of colors it has been
ever since.

Neanderthal
Man

In western Germany, in the
Neander River Valley (Ne-
anderthal in German), work-
ers were clearing out a
limestone cave in 1856 and
came across some bones.
This was not unusual, and
what was commonly done
in such cases was to throw
away the bones. This time,
though, the word reached a
professor at a nearby
school, and he managed to
salvage about fourteen of
the bones, including a
skull.

By this time, geologists
were sure the Earth was
very old, and biologists
