cal, because light is too eas-
ily stopped by obstacles
and too easily absorbed
and scattered by mist, dust,
and fog. Radio waves are
much more penetrating,
but those most commonly
used in communication are
so long that they bend
around obstacles rather
than being reflected. How-
ever, if the shortest radio
waves (microwaves) are
used, they are reflected by
moderately sizable objects
and are sufficiently pene-
trating to pass through
cloud and fog.

The Scottish physicist
Robert Alexander Watson-
Watt (1892-1973) worked
on devices for the emission
of microwaves and for the
detection of the reflected
beam. By 1935 he could use
his device to follow the
path of an airplane by the
microwave reflections it
sent back.

The system was called
radio detection and ranging,
abbreviated to ra. d. a. r., or
radar. This development
was to prove of life-and-
death importance in just a
few years.

 

Imprinting

In 1935 the Austrian-born
German zoologist Konrad
Lorenz (1903—1989), a stu-
dent of bird behavior, de-
scribed imprinting. He
showed that at a certain
critical point in early life,
soon after hatching, young
birds learned to follow a
moving object, usually
their mother, who was sure
to be in the neighborhood
after all. If this for some rea-
son was not the case, the
hatchlings would follow
some other adult bird or a
human being or even a
pulled inanimate object

Once imprinting had
taken place, it affected
their behavior to some ex-
tent all their lives.

Lorenz thus estab-
lished the science of ethol-
ogy, the study of animal
behavior in natural envi-
ronments, and initiated the
study of how learned behav-
ior in very early life af-
fected later events. For his
work on animal behavior,
he was awarded a share in
the Nobel Prize for physiol-
ogy and medicine in 1973.

 

 

Richter Scale

Earthquakes, as everyone
who has studied, experi-
enced, or heard of them

know
tensities. Some are percep-

 

come in various i

   

tible only to instruments
Some are capable of level-
ing a city.

In 1935 the American
geophysicist Charles Fran-
cis Richter (1900—1985) es-
tablished the Richter scale
for the measurement of
earthquake intensity.

This scale measured
the extent of Earth move-
ment by a series of num-
bers, each one of which
represented a movement
ten times as great as the
number before. The dam-
age done rises even faster
than the extent of move-
ment. The strongest earth-
quakes so far recorded have
reached 8.9 on the Richter
scale.
