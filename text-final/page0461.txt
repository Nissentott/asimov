physicists often speak of
the Lorentz-FitzGerald con-
traction.

Helium on Earth

The time had passed when
a new element could be dis-
covered and then treated as
though it existed all by it-
self. Mendeleyev with his
periodic table (see 1869)
had shown that elements
existed in families.

Argon, discovered the
year before by Rayleigh
and Ramsay (see 1894), did
not fit in with any existing
family, but it seemed to be
in the neighborhood of chlo-
rine and potassium as far
as its atomic weight was
concerned. Since the peri-
odic table was based
largely on valence (see
1852), it made sense to put
argon between chlorine and
potassium. Chlorine and
potassium each had a va-
lence of 1, and since argon
formed no combinations
with other atoms at all, it
had to have a valence of 0.
The valence progression of
1,0, 1 made sense, and
argon would be the first
member of a new family of
elements of 0 valence.

In that case, where
were the others? Ramsay
made it his business to look
for them. In 1895 he
learned that in America,
samples of a gas taken for
nitrogen had been obtained

from a uranium mineral.
That looked hopeful, for the
0-valence gases could be
mistaken for the rather
inert nitrogen but for no
other gas.

Ramsay repeated the
work with a uranium min-
eral and got a gas that re-
sembled nitrogen in its
inertness. He tested the gas
spectroscopically, how-
ever, and it did not produce
the spectral lines of nitro-
gen. Instead it produced
the spectral lines that Ram-
say recognized as those de-
tected by Janssen in
sunlight (see 1868).

Janssen's solar element
had been named helium,
and now Ramsay had iden-
tified it on Earth, and
found that it would lie be-
tween hydrogen and lith-
ium in the periodic table.
As to what helium might be
doing in the uranium min-
eral, that was a puzzle, but
the answer was not long in
coming.

Magnetism
and Heat

People must have noticed
that if a magnet was made
red hot it would lose its
magnetism. Curie (see
1880) showed that this was
not a gradual effect. There
was a specific temperature
(now called the Curie ten-
perature) at which the mag-

netism of iron disappeared.
This happens to be 770° C.

Other metals that have
the same strong response to
magnetism that iron does
(and are therefore said to
be ferromagnetic, from the
Latin word for “iron") also
have Curie temperatures.
For nickel it is 358° C, and
for cobalt, 1131° C.

Radio Antennas

Once Hertz had demon-
strated the existence of
radio waves (see 1888), the
possibility of using such
waves in signaling across
long distances occurred to
a number of people. If one
could use such radiation for
the purpose, one could do
away with total depen-
dence on telegraph wires
and cables. Indeed, the Brit-
ish call communications by
radio waves wireless telegra-
phy or for short wireless.
Americans call it radioreleg-
raphy or for short radio.

Of course, to make
such communication possi-
ble, one needs a far better
detector than the simple
loop Hertz used. In 1890 a
French physicist, Edouard-
Eugeéne Branly (1844
1940), invented a detector
that consisted of a con-
tainer of loosely packed
metal filings. It ordinarily
conducted little current,
but it conducted quite a bit
when radio waves fell upon
