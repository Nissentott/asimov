entists and philosophers
were no longer content
with Aristotle’s world view
and other elements of an-
cient scientific thinking
that the Catholic Church
had come to embrace. This
was the case with astron-
omy and Nicolaus Coperni-
cus, whose book Concerning
the Revolution of the Heav-
enly Bodies (1543) started
the Scientific Revolution.
With a Sun-centered sys-
tem the observed motions
of the planets now made
sense, although the Church
still held that the Earth
was the center of the uni-
verse. The revolution in as-
tronomy continued. In 1572
Tycho Brahe's report of a
new star in the northern
sky brought into doubt the
ancient idea that the heav-
ens were unchanging. In
1609 Johannes Kepler’s
claim that the planets
moved in ellipses added fur-

ther insult to the ancient
theories, in which the circle
was the perfect form. In
1609 Galileo Galilei made a
telescope, looked at the
Milky Way, and declared
for the first time that it was
made up of countless faint
stars. He was also inter-
ested in Earth-based phe-
nomena and in 1589
established that the pull of
gravity causes an object to
move with constantly in-
creasing speed. This sugges-
tion that gravity, not divine
power, caused the move-
ment of the Universe was
another challenge to tradi-
tion. The work of Isaac
Newton in optics, mathe-
matics, and physics was the
culmination of the Scien-
tific Revolution. His earli-
est investigations, into the
properties of light, led to
his invention of an im-
proved telescope. While
pursuing the problem of
gravity, he devised calcu-

lus, the basis of higher
mathematics. Newton's
analysis of the mechanical
forces that control the uni-
verse justified the findings
of Copernicus, Tycho,
Kepler, and Galileo. Just as
many fields of study were
opened during this period,
so several fundamentals of
the discipline of science
were established. The “first
publication” rule came to
be accepted; it states that
credit goes not to the first
person who makes a discov-
ery but to the one who first
publishes it. Galileo is gen-
erally given credit for set-
ting the parameters of
experimental science with
his work on falling bodies
and acceleration. Francis
Bacon formalized the philo-
sophical framework for the
scientific method: that sci-
entific findings must be
based on large amounts of
specific observation.

 

Printing

There is no way to overesti-
mate the importance of
writing (see 3500 B.c.). Nev-
ertheless, it can’t be denied
that writing is a tedious
process, and there have al-
ways been efforts to hasten
it. The Egyptians worked
out faster ways of scrawl-

ing their complicated sym-
bols, and the Romans
worked out systems of
shorthand.

The ancient Sumeri-
ans, however, developed lit-
tle cylinders of hard stone
with designs incised into
them that could be rolled
onto soft clay so that the de-
signs were impressed, and

these could be made perma-
nent by baking. The cylin-
ders could be used over and
over again and served as a
signature for the owner.
Why could not the
same system be used for
pressing symbols onto a
sheet of paper? If a block
with a raised reversed sym-
bol on it is smeared with
