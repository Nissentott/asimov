Frege received a letter from
the British mathematician
Bertrand Arthur William
Russell (1872-1970). The
letter contained a question
about an apparent self-con-
tradiction in Frege's system
and asked Frege to remove
it. Frege, after deep
thought, realized that his
system of logic could not
handle the contradiction,
so that he found his project
worthless at the moment of
completion.

This failure was to
have important ramifica-
tions in mathematics.

Substances such as salt and
sugar, which dissolve in
water, separate into single
ions or molecules of the
same order of size as the
water molecules among
which they are dispersed.
Sometimes substances are
made up of giant mole-
cules, such as those of pro-
teins, or disperse as
clusters of ordinary small
molecules, the clusters

being of comparatively
large size.

In 1861 the Scottish
physical chemist Thomas
Graham (1805-1869) noted
that small molecules in so-
lution could pass through
membranes with fine holes,
such as a sheet of parch-
ment. Large molecules or
molecular clusters in solu-
tion could not. Graham
called the former crys-
talloids, because crystalline
solids usually dissolved as
small molecules. The latter
he called colloids, from the
Greek for “'glue,” because a
solution of glue contained
large molecules (proteins,
usually) that did not pass
through the parchment.

The Irish physicist
John Tyndall (1820-1893)
pointed out that light pass-
ing through a crystalloidal
solution was not affected
by the molecules of water
or dissolved material. Such
solutions were optically
clear. The larger molecules
or molecular clusters in col-
loids scattered light, on the
other hand, and did so

  

more effectively for the
shorter wavelengths. This
is the Tyndall effect.

Tyndall pointed out
that dust particles in the
air scattered shortwave
light particularly, so that
the sky was blue and the
Sun at setting (when its
light passed through a
great thickness of dusty air)
was red—the long waves
being less scattered.

The Austrian-born Ger-
man chemist Richard Adolf
Zsigmondy (1865-1929)
took advantage of this scat-
tering of light by colloidal
particles in 1902. He sent a
beam of light through a col-
loidal solution and viewed
the light scattered at right
angles to the beam through
a microscope. In this way,
colloidal particles, invisible
to ordinary microscopes,
could be seen, in what Zsig-
mondy called an ultramicro-

scope.

For his work on col-
loids with his ultramicro-
scope, Zsigmondy was
awarded the Nobel Prize
for chemistry in 1925.
