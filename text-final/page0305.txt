Chlorophyll

Since Priestley had first
shown that plants could re-
store the vitality of air (see
1771), chemists had
searched for the substance
that gave plants this prop-
erty.

Two who were particu-
larly keen on research into
plant chemistry were the
French chemists Pierre-Jo-
seph Pelletier (1788—1842)
and Joseph-Bienaimé Ca-
ventou (1795-1877). To-
gether they isolated a
number of alkaloids such as
brucine, cinchonine, qui-
nine, and strychnine.

In 1817 they isolated a
green compound from
plants (indeed, the com-

pound that made them
green) and called it chloro-
phyll, from Greek words
meaning ‘green leaf.” As
was eventually discovered,
it was this compound that
trapped the energy of sun-
light and converted carbon
dioxide and water into
plant tissue and oxygen.

Cadmium,
Lithium,
Selenium

New elements continued to
be discovered.

In 1817 a German
chemist, Friedrich Stroh-
meyer (1776—1835), ana-
lyzed a bottle in an
apothecary's shop that con-

tained zinc carbonate. He
found that it turned yellow
on strong heating, which it
shouldn’t have done. It had
to contain an impurity, and
when he tracked it down,
he found it was a new ele-
ment, which he named cad-
miwm from the Latin name
for a zinc ore.

In the same year, a
Swedish chemist, Johan Au-
gust Arfwedson (1792—
1841), discovered the ele-
ment lithiwm (from the
Greek for “stone,” because
it was found in minerals,
whereas sodium and pot-
assium, which were simi-
lar, were found in plants,
and Berzelius (see 1803) dis-
covered seleniiom (from the
Greek word for “moon").
