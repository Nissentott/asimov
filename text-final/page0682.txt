1959

 

Moon Probes

On January 2, 1959, the So-
viet Union launched Lunik
I. This was the first rocket
to surpass escape velocity
(7 miles per second), so that
it should recede from Earth
indefinitely. It was aimed
in the direction of the
Moon, so that it was the
first Moon probe. It missed
the Moon by a considerable
margin and took up an inde-
pendent orbit about the
Sun, so that it became the
first artificial planet.

On September 12,
1959, the Soviet Union
launched Lunik 11, which
was better aimed. It struck
the Moon, and for the first
time in history, an Ubjcul

 

made by human beings
rested on the surface of an-
other world.

Then, on October 4,
1959, two years to the day
after the first satellite
launch, the Soviet Union
sent Lunik 111 behind the
Moon. It sent back the first
photographs of the far side,
the side never before seen
by human beings. Forty
minutes of photos were
taken from a height of
40,000 miles above the
lunar surface. The photo-

 

graphs were fuzzy, but they

showed that the far side
was riddled with craters as
the near side was although
lacking the relatively cra-
ter-free maria, or seas, that
existed on the near side.

 

Why the two hemispheres
are so different remains a
mystery.

Shape of the
Earth

The previous year, the
United States had launched
a small satellite, Vanguard
I. It revolved about the
Earth in 2'4 hours and its
orbit could be studied in
great detail. Its perigee (the
point of its closest ap-
proach to the Earth) moved
somewhat with each revolu-
tion, in part because of the
gravitational pull of the
Earth's equatorial bulge
upon it.
