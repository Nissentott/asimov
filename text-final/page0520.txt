further advance involving
that metal in 1913: he used
a block of tungsten as an
anode in a cathode-ray tube
to produce X rays. This in-
creased the ease and effi-
ciency with which X rays
could be produced.
Whereas hitherto X rays
had been almost entirely a
laboratory phenomenon,
the new Coolidge tube made
it possible to use them in in-
dustry, medicine, and den-
tistry.

Nitrogen-Filled
Light Bulbs

Even with the use of Coo-
lidge’s tungsten filaments
(see above), light bulbs
were not immortal. The
high-melting tungsten very
slowly vaporized at the
temperatures required to
produce adequate light.
The filament thinned and
eventually broke.

The American chemist
Irving Langmuir (1881—
1957) argued that by keep-
ing hot metal in a vacuum,
vaporization was encour-
aged, but the presence of
gas pressure would cut
down the rate. Naturally,
one couldn't use air, for
then the tungsten would
burn, but why not use pure
nitrogen? Nitrogen-filled
bulbs did indeed decrease

the rate of evaporation and
provide longer-lasting light
bulbs.

Eventually, argon was
used in place of nitrogen.
Hot tungsten reacted
slowly even with nitrogen,
but not at all with the just
about totally inert argon.
The use of gas in light bulbs
was also a safety measure,
If light bulbs were acciden-
tally dropped, the breakage
was not as shattering when
there was gas pressure in-
side as when there was a
vacuum.

Stark Effect

In 1913 the German physi-
cist Johannes Stark (1874—
1957) demonstrated that
strong electric fields caused
a multiplication in spectral
lines. The Stark effect was
the analog of the Zeeman ef-
fect involving magnetic
fields (see 1896). For this
finding, Stark was awarded
the Nobel Prize for physics
in 1919,

Magellanic
Cloud
Distances

In 1913 Hertzsprung, who
had earlier noted the differ-
ence between red giant
stars and red dwarf stars
(see 1905), was able to work
out the actual distances of

some Cepheid variables.
Once he had done this, he
could make use of Leavitt's
period-luminosity law,
worked out the previous
year (see 1912), to deter-
mine the distances of Ceph-
eids in the Magellanic
Clouds and therefore the
distance of the Magellanic
Clouds themselves. This
distance proved to be
something over 150,000
light-years.

This was the first dis-
tance to be determined for
any object lying outside our
own Milky Way Galaxy.

Ozonosphere

Although oxygen is a major
component of Earth's atmo-
sphere, the three-atom mol-
ecule ozone (see 1840) is
not found in more than
trace amounts in the air
around us. That is just as
well, of course, for it is poi-
Sonous.

In 1913, however, the
French physicist Charles
Fabry (1867—1945) was
able to demonstrate the
presence of significant
quantities of ozone in the
upper atmosphere, between
heights of 6 and 30 miles.
This region is sometimes
called the ozonosphere in
consequence. There, the
ozone is extremely useful,
for it absorbs and blocks
the more energetic ultravio-
