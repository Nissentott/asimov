Cobalt

It puzzled miners that a
blue mineral resembling
copper ore did not yield
copper when smelted. The
miners assumed it was cop-
per ore that had been be-
witched by kobolds—earth
spirits who were thought to
be malevolent at times.
In 1737 a Swedish
chemist, Georg Brandt
(1694—-1768), investigated

1738

   

the blue ore and managed
to obtain a metal from it
but one that was definitely
not copper. Brandt gave it
the name of the earth
spirit, spelling it cobalt,
and that is still the name of
the element.

Cobalt was the first
new element discovered
since Brand’s discovery of
phosphorus three-quarters
of a century earlier (see
1669). Since phosphorus is

not a metal, cobalt was also
the first metal to be discov-
ered that was not known to
the ancients or to the medi-
eval alchemists,

Brandt was perhaps
the first important chemist
to be completely free of any
alchemical taint, and after
him the discovery of new el-
ements continued till con-
temporary times.

 

Kinetic Theory
of Gases

Boyle had supposed gases
to consist of widely spaced
atoms, since that would ac-
count for the fact that gases
could be compressed-(see
1662).

This notion was carried
further by a Swiss mathe-
matician, Daniel Bernoulli
(1700—1782). He assumed
that the atoms making up
gases were always in rapid,

random movement, collid-
ing with each other and
with the walls of the con-
taining vessel. (This is
called the kinetic theory of
gases; kinetic is from the
Greek word for “motion.")
If the temperature

rises, the atoms move faster

and collide harder and thus
move a bit farther away
from each other. For that
reason, the volume in-
creases as the temperature
rises and decreases as the
temperature falls, if pres-

 

sure remains the same. If
the volume is kept from
changing, then the pressure
(the force with which the
atoms hit the walls) in-
creases as the temperature
goes up and decreases as
the temperature goes down.

This description turned
out to be correct, but an ad-
equate mathematical treat-
ment of the subject did not
arrive for another century
and a quarter.
