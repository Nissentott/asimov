Arctic Ocean

Nansen, who had crossed
Greenland (see 1888), now
made ready to explore the
Arctic Ocean.

He designed a strong
ship that would be lifted,
rather than crushed, when
the ocean about it froze. He

named the ship Fram (For-
ward) and set sail in 1893
with thirteen men aboard.
His idea was to let himself
be frozen in by the sea ice
and carried along with it in
its slow swirl about the Arc-
tic Ocean, perhaps reaching
the North Pole itself.

He remained on the

ship for a year and a half,
and although he never
reached the North Pole, he
got closer to it (86.23 de-
grees North) than anyone
before him ever had

Argon

Ever since Prout had sug-
gested that all atoms were
built up of hydrogen atoms
(see 1815), chemists had
been checking the atomic
weights of various elements
with greater and greater ac-
curacy. The fact that so
many atomic weights were
not multiples of hydrogen’s
seemed to disprove Prout’s
hypothesis.

Twelve years before,
for instance, the British
physicist John William
Strutt, Lord Rayleigh
(1842-1919), had shown

that the atomic weight of
oxygen, although usually
considered to be 16 times
the atomic weight of hydro-
gen, is actually 15.882
times the atomic weight of
hydrogen.

Rayleigh went on to
measure the atomic weight
of nitrogen and then en-
countered a puzzle.
Whereas oxygen always
had the same atomic
weight no matter how it
was prepared, nitrogen did
not. Nitrogen prepared
from the atmosphere con-
sistently showed a slightly
higher atomic weight than

 

nitrogen prepared from a
variety of nitrogen-con-
taining compounds.
Rayleigh could not find
a suitable explanation for
this and wrote a letter to
the journal Nature, asking
for suggestions. The British
chemist William Ramsay
(1852-1916) rose to the
challenge. He remembered
having read that Cavendish
(see 1766) had tried to com-
bine the nitrogen of air
with oxygen and had found
that a small bubble of
remained behind, which
would simply not ¢
with oxygen. C
