he had also shared in that
prize in 1956 for the discov-
ery of the transistor, he be-
came the first person ever
to receive two Nobel Prizes
in physics.

UNIVAC

Mauchly and Eckert, who
had designed ENIAC (see
1946), designed UNIVAC
(Universal Automatic Coin-
puter) in 1951. It was the
first computer to make use
of magnetic tape and the
first to be mass-produced
rather than individually
built by the designers for
their own use. It marked
the beginning, then, of com-
puters in industry.

Steroid
Synthesis

Woodward, who had made
it his business to synthesize
the most complex of natu-
rally occurring organic mol-
ecules (see 1944, Synthesis
of Quinine), achieved the
synthesis of cholesterol and
cortisone in 1951. These
were both steroids, with
molecules possessing a
characteristic four-ring

structure.

Acetylcoenzyme

Lipmann had demon-
strated the existence of co-
enzyme A (see 1947) as the
carrier of the acetyl group,
which represented a crucial
crossroad in metabolism.

In 1951 the German
biochemist Feodor Felix
Konrad Lynen (1911-1979)
studied the function of co-
enzyme A in the metabo-
lism of fat molecules
particularly. He was the
first to isolate acetylcoen-
zyme A, the compound that
acts as intermediary in the
transference of the acetyl
group from one compound
to another.

This work paralleled
the work done the year be-
fore by Bloch, who used
carbon-14 as a tracer to
work out the way coenzyme
A was involved with choles-
terol synthesis. As a result,
Lynen shared with Bloch
the Nobel Prize for physiol-
ogy and medicine in 1964

 

Fluoridation

ThL’ most common i.li.‘sl,'i\>\'
afflicting mankind is caries,
more \_‘(Jll‘lln(?i‘il\ known as

 

tooth decay. The incidence
until recently was almost
100 percent. Modern den-
tistry handles it by drilling
away the affected area and

 

 

substituting fillings of ce-
ramic or metal

Prevention, however, is
better than cure, and den-
tists had noticed that peo-
ple in certain areas in the
United States rarely got
caries. Their teeth also
showed a mottling of the
enamel, caused apparent]
by the fact that their drink-
ing water had a higher-
than-average content of
fluoride ions.

The search began fora
level of fluoride in the
water that would protect
against tooth decay with-
out mottling or darkening
tooth enamel. By 1951, proj-
ects for the careful fluori-
dation of water supplies
were in progress, in the
hope that this (and the use
of fluoridated toothpaste)
would substantially reduce

     

 

 

the incidence of tooth
