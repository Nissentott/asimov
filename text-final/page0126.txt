Such tables had been pre-
pared in the time of the
Greeks, but Rhiticus pre-
pared the best yet and, for
the first time, related the ra-
tios to the size of the angle
(as is now invariably done)
rather than to arcs of cir-
cles.

These trigonomeric ta-
bles, combined with Coper-
nicus’s heliocentric view,
made it possible for compu-
tational astronomy to take
a big leap forward.

Planetary Tables

Copernicus had pointed the
way to better determina-
tions of planetary motions,

but he had not made a
major effort himself to pro-
duce the necessary tables.
This was done in 1551
by the German mathemati-
cian Erasmus Reinhold
(1511-1553), with the back-
ing of Albert (1490—1568)
who was the last grand
master of the Teutonic
Knights. (This was a Catho-
lic order, but Albert led it
into Lutheranism in 1544
and made himself duke of
Prussia, the easternmost
German province.)
Reinhold went over Co-
pernicus’s mathematics,
sharpening and improving
it, then prepared what he
called Tabulae Prutenicae

(Prussian Tables) in honor
of his patron. They were
better than the Alfonsine
Tables of three centuries
earlier, which had been
based on Ptolemy’s mathe-
matics—but not much bet-
ter. The planetary system
had to be improved beyond
Copernicus if tables were to
be seriously improved, and
that wasn't to happen for
another half-century.

 

1552

 

Eustachian
Tube

Vesalius's new anatomy
(see 1543) spurred on the
field generally.

The Italian anatomist
Bartolommeo Eustachio
(1520-1574) prepared a

book on anatomy in 1552,
nine years after Vesalius's.
In some respects it was
more accurate than the ear-
lier book, but the illustra-
tions were not as beautiful.
Eustachio described a nar-
row tube connecting the
ear and the throat, which
has been known as the Eu-

stachian tube ever since,
though it may have been
discovered by a Greek phy-
sician, Alcmaeon (see 500
B.C., Dissection), two thou-
sand years before.

Eustachio was also the
first to describe the adrenal
glands.
