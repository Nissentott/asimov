General
Relativity

Eleven years before, Ein-
stein had advanced his spe-
cial theory of relativity, in
which he showed that the
laws of physics remained
unchanged in systems mov-
ing at constant velocity rel-
ative to each other (see
1905). In 1916 he extended
this to systems moving rela-
tive to each other at any ve-
locity, however changing.
This was his general theory
of relativity, often shortened
to general relativity.

To make this possible,
he assumed that inertial
mass (mass derived from
measurements of accelera-
tion) and gravitational
mass (mass derived from
measurements of gravita-
tional intensity) were iden-
tical. He also assumed that
space was curved in the
presence of mass, and that
gravitation was not a force
but merely the result of
moving objects following

 

the shortest possible path
in curved space.

He advanced a set of
equations to cover all this,
equations that allowed
grand conclusions to be
drawn about the universe
as a whole, so that he
founded the science of cos-
mology. Einstein pointed
out that Newton’s laws of
gravitation produced re-
sults quite close to those of
general relativity but that
there were three kinds of
differences that might be
measured in order to de-
cide which was a closer ap-
proach to reality.

First, Einstein’s theory
allowed for a shift in the po-
sition of the perihelion of a
planetary orbit slightly be-
yond that which would be
expected in a Newtonian
Universe. This advance of
the perihelion had been dis-
covered by Leverrier in the
case of Mercury (see 1846,
Vulcan) seventy years ear-
lier. General relativity ex-
plained it without having
to call upon an intra-Mer-

curian planet, which had
never been found. The fact
that this effect was already
known rather diminished
its importance, however.

Second, Einstein
showed that light moving
upward against a strong
gravitational field should
show a red shift. This in-
volved something that had
not been expected earlier,
but even the Sun'’s gravita-
tional field wasn’t intense
enough to make the mea-
surement practical. Noth-
ing much could be done
with the prediction, there-
fore.

Third, and most dra-
matic, Einstein showed
that light would be de-
flected by a gravitational
field substantially more
than would be expected in
a Newtonian Universe, and
the difference could be mea-
sured. To do so, however, it
would be necessary to lo-
cate stars in the neighbor-
hood of the Sun during a
total eclipse. Their light
would have reached Earth
