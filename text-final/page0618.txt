discovered by Witt (see
1898), and Eros could on oc-
casion approach more
closely than any planet.

In 1931 Eros ap-
proached within 16,000,000
miles of Earth, and a long,
detailed program was set
up in advance. Fourteen ob-
servatories in nine coun-
tries took part under the
leadership of the English as-
tronomer Harold Spencer
Jones (1890-1960). Seven
months were spent on the
project, nearly three thou-
sand photographs were
taken, and the position of
Eros was determined on
each.

Ten years of calcula-
tion followed, and by 1941
Jones was able to announce
that the distance of the Sun
was 93,005,000 miles, That
was the most accurate de-
termination yet and was
probably the best that
could be done until meth-
ods transcending the aceu-
racy of parallax
determination were de-
vised.

Jet Planes

During the forty-year his-
tory of airflight, planes had
been propelled through the
air by the aptly named pro-
peller. There was no ques-
tion, though, that a plane
could also be made to move
through the air, perhaps

even more quickly and effi-
ciently, by means of the
rocket principle—by burn-
ing fuel and ejecting a jet of
exhaust gas at high speed
(such planes are therefore
called jet planes).

The advantage jet
planes had over rockets
such as those developed by
Goddard (see 1926) was
that they traveled through
the atmosphere, so they
needed to carry only fuel
and could make use of the
oxygen in the surrounding
air as the oxidizer.

Plans for engines that
made some use of the jet
principle can be traced
back to 1921, but the first
patent for a jet engine of
the type used today was ob-
tained by a British aeronau-
tical engineer, Frank
Whittle (b. 1907), in 1930.

The first jet plane mak-
ing use of Whittle’s engine
was flown in May 1941. Jet
planes were developed too
late to play much of a role
in World War II, but they
came into their own after-
ward.
