different combinations, ei-
ther two or three at a time,
the various hadrons could

be accounted for.

The most startling
thing about these quarks
was that, if they were to
produce hadrons properly,
they had to have fractional
electric charges. Some had
charges of plus or minus '3
or %. The notion of frac-
tional charges was hard to
take, but the quark theory
explained so much that it
was accepted perforce and
earned for Gell-Mann the
Nobel Prize for physics in
1969.

Lawrencium

The attempt to produce
more and more complex
atoms did not cease. In
1961 a few atoms of ele-
ment 103 were produced,
and it was named lawren-
cium after Lawrence, the in-
ventor of the cyclotron (see
1930), who had died three
years earlier.

With lawrencium, the
last of the actinides (see
1940) was discovered.
There were now fifteen ac-
tinides as there were fifteen
lanthanides,

The Genetic
Code

With the transition of ge-
netic information from
DNA to messenger RNA to
transfer RNA to protein
now well established (see
1956), the most important
unanswered question was
which trinucleotide corres-
ponded to which amino
acid. Without knowing
that, one couldn’t under-
stand how information
passed from DNA to pro-
teins.

The American biochem-
ist Marshall Warren Niren-
berg (b. 1927) took the first
step toward elucidating the
problem. He made use of
the enzyme discovered by
Ochoa (see 1955) to form an
RNA molecule out of a mix-
ture that consisted of uri-
dylic acid only. The RNA
molecule that resulted was
not one that existed natu-
rally but a synthetic, polyur-
idylic acid (—U—U—U—U
—U—), made up of a chain
of uracil nucleotides
only. The only possible
trinucleotide in such an
RNA molecule would be
U—u—u.

When Nirenberg used
polyuridylic acid as mes-
senger RNA, it worked.
Transfer-RNA molecules
settled upon it and amino
acids combined to form a

protein. The protein was
made up only of the amino
acid phenylalanine.

This made it quite
clear that the trinucleotide
U—U—U was equivalent to
the amino acid phenylala-
nine. Similar tactics re-
vealed the equivalence of
other trinucleotides to
other amino acids until the
entire genetic code was
worked out.

As a result, a share of
the Nobel Prize for medi-
cine and physiology was
awarded to Nirenberg in
1968. Of the two others
who shared the prize, one
was the Indian-born Ameri-
can chemist Har Gobind
Khorana (b. 1922), who
also did important work in
elucidating the code.

Gene
Regulators

Jacob and Monod, who had
first suggested the existence
of messenger RNA (see
1956), puzzled over the fact
that different cells in a
body had different chemis-
tries even though they all
had the same genetic
makeup.

They decided that
genes did not always work
at the same rate, that there
were devices that could
slow down or speed up the
workings of a particular
gene, and that different
