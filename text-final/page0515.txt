Continental
Drift

As soon as the shoreline of
South America had been
mapped, three and a half
centuries before, people
had noticed that South
America and Africa gave
the impression that they
would fit together neatly if
they were moved together.

 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
   

In 1912 the German ge-
ologist Alfred Lothar Weg-
ener (1880-1930) proposed
that Africa and South
America had indeed once
formed a single landmass,
which had broken in two,
and that the two parts had
then moved apart in a sort
of continental drift.

In fact, he suggested
that all the continents had
originally formed a single
mass (Pangaea, Greek for
“all-earth”) surrounded by
a continuous ocean (Pantha-
lassa, Greek for “all-sea”).

This large granite mass of
Pangaeca had broken into
chunks that slowly sepa-
rated, floating on a basalt
ocean-floor, and over hun-
dreds of millions of years,
produced the pattern of
fragmented continents that
we now have.

Unfortunately, the no-
tion of granite floating on
basalt did not seem a tena-
ble hypothesis, and on the
whole, few people took
Wegener's notions seriously
at the time.

 

 

X-Ray
Diffraction

Once Barkla had shown
that X rays were electro-
magnetic radiation (see
1906), the question arose of
what their wavelengths
might be. The ordinary way
of measuring the wave
length of electromagnetic
radiation was to pass that
radiation through a fine
grating. However, to mea-
sure very short wave-
lengths, very fine gratings
were required, and no grat-
ing fine enough to measure
wavelengths as short as
those of X rays could be
manufactured.

It occurred to a Ger-
man physicist, Max
Theodor Felix von Laue
(1879-1960), that it was un-

:gsary to manufacture
