time (a quark and an anti-
quark) to form mesons and
three at a time to form pro-
tons, neutrons, and other
hadrons

Murray Gell-Mann (see
1953), who had originated
the quark concept, labored
to work out the rules gov-
erning the combination of
quarks, He suggested that
each quark came in three
colors: red, blue, and green.
(These colors are not to be
taken literally but as an
analogy.) Just as in the case
of light, a red, a blue, and a
en quark will combine
to give a lack of color prop-
erty (white). Only those
combinations yielding
white can exist

In this way, Gell-Mann
founded the study of quan-
tum chromodynamics, on
the model of quantum elec-
trodynamics, which had
proved to work so well (see
1948). Quarks, however, are
much more complicated in
their behavior in connec-

connection with the electro-
magnetic interaction, and
quantum chromodynamics

CAT Scan

X rays had been used in
medical diagnosis for three-
quarters of a century, but
in all that time they had
been used only to obtain a
two-dimensional photo-
graph of a three-dimen-
sional body.

In 1972 a technique
was introduced called com-
puterized axial tomographic
anning (CAT scan), in
which numerous X-ray
‘stills”" were taken in such
a way that they could be
put together to form a
three-dimensional image.

In another medical ad-
vance, the British surgeon
John Charnley devised the
first satisfactory plastic re-
placement for the fitting of
the thighbone into the hip

    

socket, in 1972, thus pre-
venting crippling through
joint degeneration.

Laser Disks

Since the phonograph had
been invented (see 1877),
sound had been reproduced
through the vibration of a
needle running along a
groove. Eventually, of
course, both needle and
groove wore out, so that
sound reproduction became
imperfect.

In 1972 laser disks (also
called compact disks) be-
came practical. Here the
sound was picked up by a
laser beam, which trans-
lated it into information re-
corded on flat disks in the
form of microscopically
small pits. These could
then be picked up by other
laser beams. There was no
question of wear, more
sound could be packed onto
a given surface, and repro-
duction was nearer perfec-
tion than ever before.
