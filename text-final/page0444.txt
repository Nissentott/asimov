Radio Waves

When Hertz was per-
forming the experiments
that gave him the first
glimpse of a photoelectric
effect (see 1887), he ex-
pected that the oscillating
current he was working
with would produce an elec-
tromagnetic wave. Each os-
cillation should produce a
wave, and the wave should
be very long. After all, since
light travels at a bit over
186,000 miles per second, a
wavelength formed in an os-
cillation of a mere hun-
dred-thousandth of a
second will still be nearly 2
miles long. In 1888, he actu-
ally observed such waves.
Hertz used, as a device
for detecting the possible
presence of such long-wave
radiation, a simple loop of
wire, with a small air gap
at one point. Just as the cur-
rent in his first coil gave
rise to radiation, so the ra-
diation produced ought to
give rise to a current in the

second coil, Sure enough,
Hertz was able to detect
small sparks jumping
across the gap in his detec-
tor coil.

By moving his detector
coil to various parts of the
room, Hertz could tell
the shape of the waves by
the intensity of the spark
formation and could calcu-
late a wavelength of 2.2
feet. This is a million times
the size of a wavelength of
ordinary light. He also man-
aged to show that the
waves were electromag-
netic in nature. At first
these long-wave radiations
were called Hertzian waves,
but later the name radio
waves came into use in-
stead.

In this way, Hertz veri-
fied the usefulness of Max-
well’s equations and
showed that light was only
a tiny section of the electro-
magnetic spectrum.

A
Le Chatelier's
Principle

The French chemist Henri-
Louis Le Chatelier (1850—
1936) stated a rule in 1888
that became known as Le
Chatelier’s principle. The
rule is this: Every change
in one of the factors of an
equilibrium brings about a
rearrangement of the sys-
tem in such a direction as
to minimize the original
change.

If a system in equilib-
rium is placed under in-
creased pressure, for
instance, the system re-
arranges itself to take up
less room, so as to mini-
mize the increased pres-
sure. Again, if the
temperature is raised, the
system undergoes a change
that absorbs some of the ad-
ditional heat, so as to mini-
mize the rise in
temperature.

This very general state-
ment included the law of
