teraction and the electro-
magnetic interaction, it
was not conserved in the
weak interaction. As a re-
sult, Yang and Lee received
the Nobel Prize for physics
in 1957.

This did not mean, by
the way, that conservation
of parity really broke down
altogether. It might merely
mean that parity had to be
combined with another
property for both to be con-
served. For instance, if par-
ticles gave off electrons
predominantly in one direc-
tion, antiparticles gave
them off predominantly in
the other direction. The
combination was called C-P
(charge conjugation and par-
ity), so scientists decided
there was a law of C-P con-
servation.

Antineutron

Once the antiproton was
discovered (see 1955), its
properties could be studied.
If it encountered a proton,
the two oppositely proper-
tied particles annihilated
each other and their masses
were converted into energy
in accordance with Ein-
steinâ€™s equation (see 1905).
If, however, a proton and
antiproton did not actually
collide but passed each
other closely, they might
not undergo annihilation,
but the positive charge of

the proton and the negative
charge of the antiproton
might neutralize each other
across the small gap, leav-
ing two uncharged parti-
cles. One would be the
neutron, of course, but the
other, as was shown in
1956, would have to be an
antineutron.

This was a puzzle.
When the notion of antipar-
ticles had been raised, the
only subatomic particles
known were electrically
charged. The electron was
negative, so the antielec-
tron had to be positive. The
proton was positive, so the
antiproton had to be nega-
tive. But since the neutron
was uncharged, neither pos-
itive nor negative, what
could the antineutron be to
make it an antineutron?

As it turned out, the
neutron, while neutral
overall, must have equal
amounts of positive and
negative electric charge dis-
tributed within. This distri-
bution must be not quite
symmetrical, so that when
the neutron spins (see 1925)
it develops a magnetic field
pointed in a particular di-
rection. The antineutron
must have its charge dis-
tributed asymmietrically in
an opposite sense, so that
when it spins in the same
way as the neutron, the
magnetic field points in the
opposite direction.

A better understanding
of charge distribution
within neutral particles
had to await further discov-
eries.

Continuous
Maser

In the maser, as first devel-
oped by Townes (see 1953),
the molecules were first
raised to a high energy
level and then allowed to
drop down to a lower level,
giving up the excess energy
in a flash of coherent micro-
wave radiation. There
would then have to be a
pause while the molecules
were again raised to a
higher level.

In 1956, however, the
Dutch-born American phys-
icist Nicolaas Bloembergen
(b. 1920) devised a maser in
which energy was on three
levels rather than two, so
that one of the upper levels
could be storing while the
other was emitting. For this
continuous maser, he re-
ceived a share of the Nobel
Prize for physics in 1981.

It had long been assumed
that Venus, being closer to
the Sun than Earth was,
would be warmer than
