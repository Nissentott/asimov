vices for capturing ter-
mites, which to them are
tasty snacks.

Undoubtedly, australo-
pithecines could do any-
thing that chimpanzees
could do. We have no evi-
dence, but we can be fairly
certain that they used tree
branches and long bones as
clubs. They could surely
throw rocks or use them as
sea otters do.

The australopithecines
may have existed on Earth
for three million years, not
becoming finally extinct till
as late as 1,000,000 B.c. For
the final third of their exis-
tence, though, they were no
longer the only hominids.
Some australopithecines
had evolved to the point
where they had become suf-
ficiently human to be
placed in the same genus
with ourselves.

About two million
years ago, in other words,
genus Homo came into
existence. For a time, it co-
existed with the australo-
pithecines, but there was
bound to be conflict be-
tween them, and in this,
the larger and brainier
hominids won out, contrib-
uting (very largely, per-
haps) to the extinction of
the australopithecines.

In the 1960s, the En-
glish anthropologist Louis
Seymour Bazett Leakey
(1903—1972), his wife,
Mary, and their son, Jona-

than, located remains of
the oldest of the genus
Homo in the Olduvai
Gorge, in what is now Tan-
zania. The hominids thus
uncovered were named
Homo habilis (Latin for
“able man," because with
them were discovered ob-
jects that seemed to indi-
cate that they made simple
stone tools).

Homwo habilis was
smaller than some of the
larger species of australo-
pithecines. When, in the
summer of 1986, fossil re-
mains of Homo habilis were
discovered that were some
1.8 million years old (the
first time that both skull
fragments and limb bones
of the same individual of
that species had been lo-
cated), they seemed to rep-
resent a small, light adult
about 3'» feet tall and with
arms that were surprisingly
long.

Though members of
Homo habilis may have
been small, they had more
rounded heads than any of
the australopithecines and
larger brains, nearly half as
large as those of modern
human beings. They had
thinner skull bones, and
based on the brain configu-
ration, if they could not
talk, they could at least
make a greater variety of
sounds. Their hands were
more like our modern
hands, and their feet were

completely modern. Their
jaws were less massive, so
that their faces looked less
apelike.

These creatures appar-
ently used stone tools to
chip pieces of {lint and so
create a sharp edge. This
meant that for the first
time, hominids had sharp
edges in quantity and did
not have to depend on the
chance finding of one. More-
over the edges could be
made truly sharp, and the
sharpness could be re-
newed when the rock was
blunted.

These stone knives in-
creased the food supply.
Homo habilis could not tear
away at the tough hides of
animals, as fanged preda-
tors such as the various
cats, dogs, and bears could.
Without knives, hominids
had to make do with car-
casses that had already
been mangled by other
predators and to make off
with what they could scav-
enge.

With knives, however,
Homo habilis had artificial
fangs that could slit hides
and scrape the meat off
hides and bones. What's
more, Homo habilis no
longer had to scavenge.
Hominids could now kill
animals on their own, even
fairly large animals. And
once they caught on to the
trick of tying stone axes to
wooden branches and creat-
