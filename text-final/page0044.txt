Maps

Egyptians and Babylonians
alike attempted to draw
maps of the world they
knew. In early times, how-
ever, traveling was diffi-
cult, and most people
either knew only their im-

The Phoenician navigators,
who had made themselves
at home the length and

through what we now call
the Strait of Gibraltar

 

The first map that we
can recognize as having
some vague relation to real-
ity was drawn by a Greek
traveler named Hecataeus
(6thâ€”5th century B.c.). He
had the advantage of living
after the Persian Empire had
been firmly established, so

to travel for thousands of
miles without encountering
war or disorder,

and into the Atlantic

Ocean.

One of the driving
forces behind them was the
depletion of eastern Medi-
terranean tin mines, since
tin is a rather rare metal.

human beings had to con-

Hecataeus drew a map
about 510 B.c. in which the
land area of the world was
shown as a circle, with the
sea around it. An arm of the
sea cuts halfway into the
circle from the west. It is
the Mediterranean. Europe
lies to the north, Africa to
the south, and Asia to the
east.

obtained somewhere; if not
in the Mediterranean lands,
then elsewhere.

The Phoenicians found
Tin Islands somewhere in
the Atlantic. They kept the
