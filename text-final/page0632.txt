Noradrenaline

It was already known that
acetylcholine was a chemi-
cal that served to transmit
a nerve impulse from one
neuron to a neighboring
neuron (see 1921, Vaguss-
toffe).

In 1946 the Swedish
physiologist Ulf Svante von
Euler (1905-1983) showed
that in that part of the ner-
vous system called the sym-
pathetic nerves, the
transmitting chemical was
noradrenaline (more prop-
erly, norepinephrine), which
was very much like the hor-
mone adrenaline in struc-
ture but was missing a
carbon atom.

Von Euler received a
share of the Nobel Prize for
medicine and physiology in
1979 for this discovery.

Bacterial
Genetics

It had long been customary
to think of reproduction in
the simplest organisms as
essentially simpler than
that in multicellular ones.
Organisms such as our-
selves reproduce by means

of sex and the intermin-
gling of genetic material
from male and female. A
one-celled organism, how-
ever, seems able simply to
divide, making use of only
its own genetic material. It
would seem that evolution
should proceed much faster
in multicellular than in uni-
cellular organisms over a
given number of genera-
tions because of this inter-
mingling of genetic
material. The shuffling of
genes might represent the
great biological advantage
of sexual reproduction.

In 1946, however, the
American geneticist Joshua
Lederberg (b. 1925), work-
ing with Tatum (see 1941),
showed that bacterial re-
production was not entirely
asexual. Different strains of
bacteria could be crossed in
such a way as to make the
genetic material intermin-
gle. It was therefore possi-
ble for organisms even as
simple as bacteria to en-
gage, on occasion, in what
is essentially sexual repro-
duction.

Virus Genetics

While Lederberg was show-
ing the unexpected com-
plexity of bacterial
reproduction (see above),
the German-born American
microbiologist Max Del-
briick (1906—1981) and Al-
fred Day Hershey (see 1945)

were independently doing
the same for those even sim-
pler organisms, the viruses.

Both showed that the
genetic material of differ-
ent strains of viruses could
be combined to form a new
strain different from either.
This too is a form of sexual
reproduction, and for this
Delbriick and Hershey re-
ceived shares of the Nobel
Prize for physiology and
medicine in 1969.

Cloud-Seeding

The American physicist
Vincent Joseph Schaefer (b.
1906) had been working
with Langmuir (see 1913)
on the phenomenon of
icing, particularly in refer-
ence to airplanes flying at
high altitudes, which could
develop layers of ice on
their wings that could
cause them to crash.

To study the produc-
tion of ice crystals,
Schaefer and Langmuir
used a refrigerated box
kept well below the freez-
ing point of water. They
hoped that in the box,
water vapor would con-
dense around dust particles
to form ice crystals. It was
important, however, to find
just the proper types of
dust particles to use as
seeds for ice formation, and
the experiments therefore
continued for some time.
