Asteroid
Photography

It had been almost a cen-
tury now since the first as-
teroid was discovered by
Piazzi (see 1802), and oth-
ers had been discovered in
astonishing numbers. By
1891, 322 asteroids had
been discovered and their
orbits calculated.

Each one, however,
had been discovered by
eye; an object would be
seen that looked like a
rather dim star but would
be shifting position against
the starry background. If it
moved at a certain rate, it
was almost certainly an as-
teroid.

In 1891 it occurred to a
German astronomer, Maxi-
milian Franz Joseph Corne-
lius Wolf (1863—1932), to
make the discoveries by
photography. If a telescope
is set to turning in time
with the movement of the
vault of the sky (a move-
ment that arises because of
the rotational motion of the
Earth), then all the stars in

the telescopic view will
show up on the film as
sharp points. An asteroid,
however, will move with re-
spect to the stars and so
will show up as a small
dash. The object responsi-
ble for the dash can then be
put under observation and
its orbit eventually calcu-
lated.

In this fashion, Wolf
discovered the 323rd aster-
oid, which he named
Brucia, and went on to dis-
cover others. In the course
of his life, he discovered
500 asteroids. Nowadays,
the orbits of nearly 2000 as-
teroids are known, and it is
estimated that there may
be as many as 100,000 aster-
oids that are at least a mile
across.

Gravitational
and Inertial
Mass

Newton had defined mass

in terms of the amount of

acceleration produced in a
body through the applica-
tion of a force of a given

magnitude. This is called
the inertial mass, because
the greater the mass of a
body, the less acceleration
a given force produces and
the greater the inertia (the
resistance to a change in ve-
locity).

Newton also found that
the intensity of an object’s
gravitational field at a
given distance depended
upon its mass. That is the
gravitational mass.

These two kinds of
mass were determined by
two entirely different kinds
of observations and would
seem to have no necessary
connection, yet the mass de-
termined by inertial effects
always seemed to be the
same as the mass deter-
mined by gravitational ef-
fects.

A Hungarian physicist,
Roland E6tvos (1848—
1919), saw that if the gravi-
tational mass and the iner-
tial mass were truly
identical, then objects in a
given gravitational field
would always drop (in a
vacuum) at the same rate,
regardless of mass. He
