Spectral Lines

Since Newton had first
studied the spectrum (see
1666), nothing much had
followed. Wollaston (see
1800) in 1802 had observed
a few dark lines in the spec-
trum but had supposed
them to be boundary lines
between the colors and had
not followed up on the mat-
ter.

Meanwhile a German
physicist, Joseph von
Fraunhofer (1787â€”1826),
was meticulously manufac-
turing the best lenses and
prisms yet made. In 1814
he was testing one by send-
ing sunlight through a nar-
row slit and then through
the prism. In effect, he pro-
duced innumerable lines of

light, each an image of the
slit and each containing a
very narrow band of wave-
lengths. Some wavelengths
were missing, however, so
that the slit images at those
particular wavelengths
were dark. The result was
that the solar spectrum was
crossed by dark lines.

In theory, these should
always have been visible,
even to Newton, but if the
prism was somewhat im-
perfect and the slit too
wide, there would be
enough fuzziness to obscure
them. Where Newton had
reported none and Wollas-
ton seven, Fraunhofer, with
his excellent instrument,
detected nearly six hundred
lines.

Fraunhofer went on to

measure the position of the
more prominent lines,
which he marked off with
letters from A to K, and
showed that they always
fell in the same portion of
the spectrum, whether the
light came directly from
the Sun or was reflected
from the Moon or planets,
Eventually he mapped the
wavelengths of several hun-
dred of these Fraunhofer
lines, as they were called.

Not much was done
with these spectral lines for
the next half-century, but
eventually they proved to
be major items in the re-
search armory of chemists
and astronomers.
