reversed the direction of
the current, the compass
needle pointed in the oppo-
site direction but still at
right angles to the current
flow.

@rsted himself did not
follow up on his discovery,
but others did. Before the
year was over, the French
physicist André-Marie Am-
pére (1775-1836) had set
up two parallel wires, one
of which was freely mov-
able back and forth. When
both wires carried current
in the same direction, the
two wires clearly attracted
each other. If the current
flowed in opposite direc-
tions, they repelled each
other. If one wire was free
to rotate, then when the
currents flowed in opposite
directions, the movable
wire rotated through a
semicircle, coming to rest
in such a position that the
currents flowed in the same
direction in both. Clearly,
wires carrying an electric
current showed magnetic
properties.

Ampeére also demon-
strated that a current flow-
ing through a wire bent
into a helix (similar in
shape to a bed spring)
strengthened the magnetic
effect with each turn of the
wire, and the helix clearly
acted like a bar magnet
with a north pole and a
south pole.

In the same year, an-

 

other French physicist,
Francois Arago (1786—
1853), showed that if a cur-
rent ran through a copper
wire, it could attract and
pick up iron filings as easily
as an ordinary steel magnet
would.

Then a German physi-
cist, Johann Salomo
Christoph Schweigger
(1779-1857), saw that the
amount of the deflection of
the needle in the @rsted ex-
periment could be used to
measure the strength of the
current. In this way, he con-
structed the first galvanome-
ter.

All these things to-
gether meant that by the
end of 1820, the phenome-
non of electro-magnetism
had established itself firmly
in physics.

Glycine
After Kirchhoff had iso-
lated glucose from starch
(see 1812), other chemists
began trying to extract sim-
ple substances from compli-
cated ones by heating in
acidified water. What hap-
pened, it was eventually
discovered, was that simple
substances bound together
by chemical bonds could be
split apart, with a hydro-
gen atom from a water mol-
ecule added to one of the
broken ends and the hydro-
gen-oxygen combination
from the same water mole-

 

cule added to the other.
This process is called hydro-
lysis (from Greek, meaning
“to loosen by water”).
Through hydrolysis, the
simple building blocks of
complex compounds could
be isolated.

One of those who was
interested in the procedure
was the French naturalist
Henri Braconnot (1781—
1855). He obtained glucose
from sawdust, linen, bark,
and other plant products,
just as Kirchhoff had ob-
tained it from starch.

Braconnot then heated
gelatin, a substance derived
from the connective tissue
of animals, and obtained a
simple substance that
tasted sweet. He named it
glycine, from the same
Greek word that gave us
glucose. (The letters u and y
are interchangeable in
transliterating Greek
words.)

Braconnot might have
thought he had a sugar, but
on further investigation of
glycine he obtained ammo-
nia, so he knew its mole-
cule must contain a
nitrogen atom, which sug-
ars do not.

As it turned out, gly-
cine was one of the amino
acids. Vauquelin had ob-
tained asparagine (see
1806), and Wollaston (see
1800) had obtained cystine
(from the Greek word for
"bladder™) from a bladder
