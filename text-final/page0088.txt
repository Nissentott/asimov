Forks

Knives and spoons are of
prehistoric origin, but forks
are relatively new. Byzan-
tine aristocrats used them
at a time when everyone in
western Europe, high and
low, ate with their fingers.

A Byzantine princess who
married a doge of Venice
brought her forks with her.
The Venetian aristocracy
picked up this obviously
cleanly habit and the fash-
ion spread.

Nevertheless, it did
seem a bit persnickety to

many people, who felt it
was an example of false gen-
tility and prissiness. To this
day we sometimes hear the
phrase “fingers were made
before forks.” So they were,
and so were dirty fingers.

Flying
Buttresses

Roman architects had
found it impossible to build
tall structures without
thick walls. When stone
came to be used for roofs,
the weight was all the heav-
ier and the walls had to be-
come enormously thick.
Nor could there be more
than a few narrow windows
if fatal weaknesses were not
to be introduced. The result

was that the Romanesque
churches of earlier centu-
ries bore a predominant at-
mosphere of squat gloom.
In the twelfth century,
however, the notion arose
of designing large struc-
tures in such a way as to
concentrate the weight of
the roof in certain areas
where outside buttresses of
masonry could be built. For
further strength, buttresses
that stood well away from
the building could be con-
nected to the key points

needing support by
diagonal structures, called
flying buttresses.

Since the buttresses
carried the weight, those
sections of the walls not di-
rectly involved in support
could be left thin and
pierced with numerous win-
dows. When the windows
were filled with stained
glass, the interior of the
structure would be
drenched with colored light
in a beautiful and impres-
sive manner. What's more,
