Fullerene
Research

Growing knowledge about
a molecule postulated in
1985, isolated in 1990, and
first imaged in 1991 led to a
flood of research on buck-
minsterfullerene (the
“buckyball,” for short), a
soccer-ball-shaped mole-
cule named for the inventor
of the geodesic dome, an-
other structure it resem-
bles

A third form of carbon
—the others are diamond
and graphite—the bucky-
ball (C60) is a highly stable
molecule consisting of 60
carbon atoms in an arrange-
ment of 12 pentagonal and
20 hexagonal faces. Its intri-
guing structure led chem-
ists to suggest that, along
with a related group of mol-
ecules called fullerenes, it
may give rise to a whole
new class of materials.

Because fullerenes are
highly resilient, they might
be used to manufacture

  

 

 

   

 

high-strength materials or
super-hard coatings. Be-
cause they do not react
with corrosive gases, they
may also be excellent lubri-
cants. Buckyballs readily
absorb and release elec-
trons, and so may be supe-
rior to the lead-acid battery
for storing energy. Shaped
into tiny tubes, they might
act as electrical conductors.

Other molecules can be
encased within the bucky-
ball’s spherical structure,
so researchers are looking
for ways to use it to deliver
diagnostic or therapeutic
chemicals to sites within
the body. Similarly, this
molecular storage unit
could encapsulate radioac-
tive substances or hold ma-
terials that store electronic
information,

One of the most excit-
ing prospects for the fuller-
enes is their potential as
warm superconductors (see
1987). With the addition of
potassium or other metals
to the buckyball structure,
researchers have achieved

superconductivity at tem-
peratures as high as 45° K,
above that at which the
oxide ceramics supercon-
duct.

Despite the large
amount of research that
has been done on the fuller-
enes, important issues re-
main. There have been
questions about their possi-
ble toxicity, an abundant
natural source has not been
found, and they are unsta-
ble when exposed to air.

Volcanic Venus

By the end of 1991, the
Venus orbiter Magellan,
sent into space in May
1989, had completed map-
ping more than 90 percent
of the planet’s surface.
Scientists were famil-
iar with the harsh atmo-
sphere on Venus: mostly
carbon dioxide, with a little
nitrogen and sulfuric acid,
at a pressure 90 times that
on Earth and superheated
to 900° F. Now Magellan's
powerful radar pierced this
