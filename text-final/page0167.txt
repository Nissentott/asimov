Double Stars

In 1650 the Italian astrono-
mer Giambattista Riccioli
(1598—-1671) observed, tele-
scopically, that Mizar, the
middle star of the handle of
the Big Dipper, was actu-
ally two stars so close to-
gether that they could not
be seen as separate with the
unaided eye. This was the
first double star to be de-
tected.

Age of the Earth

Of the written materials
available to Europeans at
this time, the Bible was the

1651

only one that claimed to
give the history of Earth
from the creation, and it
was generally accepted by
all scientists as the authori-
tative word of God at this
time and for two more cen-
turies. (Many people accept
it as such to this day.)

The Bible does not use
any acceptable chronology
for its early history, but by
following back from the
reign of King Saul and mak-
ing use of hints here and
there in the earlier histori-
cal sections, it is possible to
decide what the biblical
date of the creation might
have been.

In 1650 James Ussher
(1581-1656), an Anglican
bishop, worked out the d

  

of the creation in this wa
and decided it had taken
place in 4004 B.c. Four
years later an English theo
logian, John Lightfoot
(1602—1675), sharpened the
date and made it 9 a.m
October 26, 4004 B.c

Such dating of creation
has no valid basis what-
ever, but it has strongly in-
fluenced popular opinion to
the present day.

 

 

Names on
the Moon

In 1651 Riccioli (see 1650,
Double Stars) published Al-
magestunt Novunt (New Al-
magest). The reference to

Ptolemy’s old book (see
140) was not accidental, for
Riccioli rejected heliocen-
tricity and insisted on an
Earth-centered astronomy
a full century after Coperni-
cus's book had been pub-

lished.

The book, however, in-
cluded a map of the Moon
with names given to the

various craters. Riccioli

  

began the habit of naming
surface features on other
worlds after astronomical

notables, and many of his
