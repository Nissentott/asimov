1497

 

India

On July 8, 1497, the Portu-
guese navigator Vasco da
Gama (1460-1524) set sail
from Lisbon with four ves-
sels. He rounded the Cape
of Good Hope on November
22, passed the farthest
point reached by Diaz (see
1487), sailed up the eastern
coast of Africa, and finally

reached Calicut, India, on
May 20, 1498.

The deed was done.
What Prince Henry the Nav-
igator had begun (see 1418)
was complete, nearly four
decades after his death. The
Portuguese had bypassed
the Ottoman Empire and
the Italian trading cities,
such as Venice. From this
point on, the Mediterra-

nean region declined in
power and wealth, and the
Atlantic powers took the
lead.

Da Gamaâ€™s trip was the
first one long enough to in-
duce scurvy in his men. It
was a debilitating disease
that eventually killed those
who suffered from it. Da
Gama lost three-fifths of his
crew to it.
