Chemical
Fertilizer

Plants make use of miner-
als in the soil, and intensive
cultivation deprives the soil
of those minerals from year
to year. If no minerals are
returned to the soil, it will
eventually lose fertility.
The time-honored way of
guarding against this is to
make use of animal wastes
as fertilizer, so that one of
the important functions of
domestic animals was to
supply material for the ma-
nure pile, which would
then have to be spread over
the fields.

The manure piles, how-
ever, were not only offen-
sively redolent, but could
also be a source of dise
(as was eventually discov-
ered).

 

 

It occurred to chemists
that it would be possible to
determine just what ele-
ments were withdrawn
from the soil and to return
them in the form of odor-
free, disease-free chemicals.

In 1842 an English ag-
ricultural scientist, John
Bennet Lawes (1814—1900),
patented a method for man-
ufacturing what he called
superphosphate and the
next year set up a factory
for its production. This was
the first chemical fertilizer.
Such fertilizers helped
sweeten the atmosphere, re-
duce the disease rate, and
increase the food supply.
(Nowadays, there is a fash-
ion for “organically grown™
food. Hiding behind that
“organically” is the ma-
nure pile.)

Doppler Effect

The coming of the locomo-
tive made a particular phe-
nomenon much more
noticeable than it had been
earlier. The combination of
speed and a warning whis-
tle did the trick. People no-
ticed that the whistle was
high in pitch as the locomo-
tive approached, and that
the pitch dropped suddenly
as the locomotive passed
and began to recede.

An Austrian physicist,
Christian Johann Doppler
(1803-1853), explained the
phenomenon correctly by
pointing out that the sound
waves partake of the mo-
tion of the source and so
reach the ear at shorter in-
tervals when the source is
approaching—hence h
pitch, When the sourc
cedes, the waves reach the
