seemed nothing of interest
about them except for the
fact of their existence.

The amateur German
astronomer Samuel Hein-
rich Schwabe (1789-1875)
had to work as a pharma-
cist, so he could not stay up
all night to observe the sky.
As something to do by day
when business was slow, he
began to study the neigh-
borhood of the Sun to see if
he could find some planet
closer to the Sun than Mer-
cury. Then the Sun itself
caught his attention, and
for seventeen years he stud-
ied its orb on every day
that it was visible.

In 1843 he announced
that the number of sun-
spots seemed to wax and
wane in a ten-year cycle.
(Later observations made
the cycle appear eleven
vears long, on the average.)
This discovery founded the
modern study of solar phys-
ics and of astrophysics in
general,

Quaternions

The discovery of non-Eu-
clidean geometries taught
mathematicians that there
were no absolute truths but
that many alternative
mathematics could exist de-
pending on the nature of
the axioms chosen. In other
words, more than one set of
axioms could give rise to
self-consistent and useful

consequences. This was so
in geometry, and the Irish
mathematician William
Rowan Hamilton (1805—
1865) showed that it

was true in algebra as
well.

Gauss had shown that
complex numbers could be
treated as though they were
points on a plane, and that
each could be represented
by two numbers. Hamilton
tried to deal with Aypercom-
plex numbers that could be
presented as points in three
or more dimensions. He
tried to work out a system
of dealing with such points
and found he could not.
Then, in 1843, the thought
came to him that he could
do so if he were willing to
abandon the commutative
law of multiplication,

It had always been
taken as self-evident that A
x B = B X A, but if this
was abandoned, Hamilton
found he could devise a
self-consistent algebra of
hypercomplex numbers, or
as he called them, quaterni-
ons (from the Latin word
for “four,” because each of
Hamilton's points involved
four numbers).

Higher Analytic
Geometry

Descartes had worked out
an analytic geometry in
two dimensions, expressing
curves by algebraic equa-

tions. The British mathema-
tician Arthur Cayley (1821—
1895) wanted to extend this
to higher dimensions, as
Hamilton had extended
imaginary numbers (also
planar). In 1843 Cayley suc-
ceeded in working out
analytic geometry in three
or more dimensions.

This would be called
n-dimensional analytic
geometry.

Wheatstone
Bridge

In 1843 Wheatstone (see
1838) used and made popu-
lar what came to be called
the Wheatstone bridge. (He
did not invent it—he freely
admitted he did not—but
there is some credit to be
derived from making a de-
vice popular and introduc-
ing it to the scientific
community.) The
Wheatstone bridge was a
device that measured the
resistance of a circuit very
delicately by balancing a
number of currents against
each other.

Transatlantic
Liner

The first ship a modern
might recognize as a trans-
atlantic liner was the S.S.
Great Britain, launched on
July 19, 1843. It was 322
feet long, had a crew of 130,
