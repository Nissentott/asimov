which would require no re-
charging and could keep a
submarine submerged for
months at a time. The first
nuclear-powered subma-
rine, the Nautilus, was
launched in January

1954.

Some nuclear-powered
surface vessels were eventu-
ally built by the Soviet
Union and the United
States, but except for sub-
marines, nuclear-powered
forms of transportation did
not catch on.

Oxytocin
Synthesis

At about the time that
Sanger was working out
the order of amino acids in
the protein chains of the in-
sulin molecule (see 1952),
Vincent du Vigneaud (see
1942) was determining the
exact makeup of the hor-
mone oxyiocin, produced
by the posterior portion of
the pituitary gland.

Oxytocin was a particu-
larly simple protein hor-
mone, its molecules made
up of only eight amino acid
residues arranged in a cir-
cle. Du Vigneaud went on
in 1954 to synthesize oxyto-
cin, combining just the
right amino acids in the
right order.

This was the first occa-
sion on which a naturally
oceurring protein was syn-
thesized and the synthetic

protein shown to have just
the same properties and
abilities as the protein as it
occurs in the body. For this,
du Vigneaud was awarded
the Nobel Prize for chemis-
try in 1955.

Chloroplast
Isolation

Since Pelletier and Caven-
tou had isolated chloro-
phyll (see 1817), it had been
well known that chloro-
phyll was essential to pho-
tosynthesis. However, no
one had been able to make
chlorophyll perform the
task in the test-tube.

It had been nearly a
century since von Sachs
had discovered that chloro-
phyll was present in dis-
crete organelles, called
chloroplasts, within the
plant cell (see 1862). It was
natural to assume that in
the cell, chlorophyll
worked as a catalyst, not by
itself but as part of an intri-
cate system that was pres-
ent intact in the
chloroplast.

This could be shown if
chloroplasts could be iso-
lated intact from the cells,
and made to show that they
could then carry out photo-
synthesis in the test-tube.
But chloroplasts are so
flimsy that for a long time
no procedure sufficed to ex-
tract them intact.

Finally in 1954 the

Polish-American biochem-
ist Daniel Israel Arnon (b.
1910) was able to obtain in-
tact chloroplasts from dis-
rupted spinach-leaf cells
and demonstrate their abil-
ity to carry on photosynthe-
sis outside the cell.

Strychnine
Synthesis

In 1954 that master-synthe-
sist Woodward (see 1944,
Synthesis of Quinine) man-
aged to synthesize the fear-
fully complicated (and
poisonous) alkaloid strych-
nine, which had a molecule
built up of seven intricately
related rings of atoms.

Genetic Code

Granted that DNA con-
tained the information that
governed the inheritance of
characteristics, it must de
this by overseeing the man-
ufacture of enyzmes, which
in turn controlled the chem-
ical reactions that went on
inside cells. But how could
DNA turn the trick? It was
composed of chains of four
different nucleotides, while
enzymes, which were pro-
teins, were composed of
chains of twenty different
amino acids,

In 1954 George Gamow
(see 1929) suggested that it
made no sense Lo try to line
up an individual nucleotide
with an individual amino
