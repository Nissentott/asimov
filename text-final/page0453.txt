made particularly delicate
measurements in 1891 and
found that objects of differ-
ent mass fell at the same
rate within five parts per
billion. If there was a differ-
ence between the two kinds
of mass, it was extremely
tiny.

This measurement
turned out to be very im-
portant later in the develop-
ment of a new and better
way of looking at gravity.

Fundamental
Unit of
Electricity
Arrhenius’s theory of ionic
dissociation (see 1884)
made it look as though
atoms or groups of atoms
could carry electric
charges. What's more, it
looked as though atoms or
atom groups would carry
charges of different sizes
that were related to each
other in ratios of exact
whole numbers.

An Irish physicist,
George Johnstone Stoney
(1826-1911), suggested that
electricity existed in funda-
mental particles, as matter
did, and that all these parti-
cles carried the same elec-
tric charge. A particular
atom or atom group would
then carry one of these par-
ticles, or two or three, and
that was why the ratios
would be in whole num-
bers.

He suggested in 1891
that the fundamental parti-
cle be called an electron.
This didn't seem to make
much of an impression at
the time, but four years
later it was to come into its
own.

Carborundum

People from the earliest
times have needed abra-
sives; that is, hard sub-
stances that can grind
down softer substances, re-
moving unevennesses and
imparting a smooth polish
to the surface. The dia-
mond is made up of carbon
atoms symmetrically
placed in tetrahedral pat-
terns, and they are very
close to each other as well
since the carbon atoms are
so small. Therefore, the
atoms in diamonds cling to-
gether more tightly than in
any other substance, so
that diamond is by far the
hardest material known.
Perfect diamonds are too
beautiful to use for any-
thing other than show and
ornamentation, but imper-
fect diamonds, or diamond
dust, can be used as abra-
sives. Even imperfect dia-
monds, however, are in
short supply.

Graphite is also made
up of carbon atoms, but in
a different, looser arrange-
ment. It is so far from being
an abrasive that it can be
used as a lubricant. By Le

Chatelier’s principle (see
1888), however, if graphite
is placed under great pres-
sure, its atoms should take
up a more compact arrange-
ment and it should become
diamond (as it does under
great pressure deep under-
ground).

Various scientists had
tried to supply the neces-
sary pressure, but up to
this time none had suc-
ceeded. An American inven-
tor, Edward Goodrich
Acheson (1856—1931), made
the attempt, too.

He did not succeed in
forming diamond either,
but in 1891, he found that
when he heated carbon
strongly with clay, he ob-
tained what he eventually
found to be a compound of
silicon and carbon, or sili-
con carbide. Silicon is much
like carbon in its proper-
ties, so that the atoms of sil-
icon carbide have a
diamond arrangement with
a silicon atom taking the
place of every other carbon.
Silicon is a larger atom and
doesn’t hold together quite
as tightly as carbon atoms
do, so silicon carbide is not
quite as hard as diamond.
Still, it was harder than
anything else known at the
time, and much cheaper
than diamond.

Acheson called the new
compound carbortndunt,
and it became extremely
useful in industry as an
abrasive.
