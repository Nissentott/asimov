ink, it can press an inked
symbol (nonreversed) onto
paper. The Chinese started
doing this about the year
350, and by 800 they were
carving entire pages on
wooden blocks. Such a
page could then be printed
any number of times, all
the impressions being ex-
actly alike. But then, it took
a long time to carve the
wooden block into a bas-
relief with all the symbols
perfectly formed.

Later the Chinese got
the idea of using a different
block for each symbol, so
that the blocks could be ar-
ranged into any desired
combination to give any de-
sired page. By 1450 they
had movable wooden char-

acters of this type, and by
1500 they were making use
of metal characters.

By then, though, the
Europeans had outstripped
them (though it is possible
that news concerning mov-
able type had reached Eu-
rope from China and given
the Europeans a head
start).

The German inventor
Johannes Gutenberg (ca.
1390—1468) had been work-
ing out the matter of mov-
able type since 1435. He
had paper to work with (it
had long ago reached Eu-
rope from China) and he ex-
perimented with different
inks. He also designed a
printing press, a device
that would press the paper

down un all those little
metal characters evenly

By 1454 Gutenberg had
worked out all the bugs in
his process and was ready
for the big task: he began to
put out a Bible, in double
columns, with forty-two
Latin lines to the column.
He produced three hundred
copies of each of 1282 pages
and that produced the
three hundred Gutenberg Bi-
bles. It was the first printed
book, and many people con-
sider it the most beautiful
ever produced—so that the
art was born at its height.
The Gutenberg Bibles that
remain today are the most
valued books in the world.
