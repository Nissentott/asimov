1986

 

Uranus Probe

On January 24, 1986, Voy-
ager 2 flew past Uranus and
gave humanity its first
close look at that distant
planet discovered by Her-
schel (see 1781), as well as
at its rings and satellites.
Uranus was found to ro-
tate in 17.24 hours (previ-
ous estimates had been
anywhere from 10 to 25
hours). It had, as expected,
a magnetic field, but one
that was tilted 60 degrees
to the rotational axis.
Uranus's rings, de-
tected from Earth nine
years earlier, were con-
firmed. The five known sat-
ellites turned out to be
somewhat larger than had
been thought, and no fewer
than ten small satellites
were found to be circling at
a smaller distance than
that of Miranda, the
already-known satellite
nearest to Uranus.
Miranda was particu-
larly astonishing. It was

 

only 300 miles in diameter,
so it could not have had
enough internal heat to
power geological change.
Nevertheless, it had a veri-
table jumble of different
surface features. It is
thought that bombardment
in its early days may have
broken it into fragments
that since then have co-
alesced every which way.

Halley’s Comet

Halley's comet returned for
the third time since Halley
had first worked out its
orbit (see 1705). Its appear-
ance in 1986 was unfortu-
nately not a showy one,
since it remained rather far
from Earth even at its clos-
est approach and could
only be seen high in the sky
from the southern hemi-
sphere.

It was an unprece-
dented return, however,
since it could now be stud-
ied by probes sent out by
the Soviet Union and by

the European Space
Agency. The European
probe, named Giotto (after
the painter who had been
the first to paint the comet
realistically—see 1304),
made the closest approach.

Comets had been pic-
tured as “dirty snowballs”
by Whipple (see 1949), and
he was shown to be right,
but Halley's comet turned
out to be far dirtier than ex-
pected. While it lost ice
each time it approached
the Sun, it lost rocky parti-
cles to a much smaller ex-
tent and they accumulated
on the surface, forming a
kind of crust, through
which the vapors formed
by heated ice broke
through at weak spots here
and there. The result was
that Halley's comet was
dark black in color.

This meant it was
larger than expected. Since
it reflected so little light, a
larger surface was required
to produce its observed
brightness.
