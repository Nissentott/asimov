Watches

A mechanical clock had to
remain vertical if it was
powered by weights being
pulled downward by grav-
ity, Nor could it be small,
for the weights could not be
reduced in size very much
without ceasing to work.
An alternative to weights
came into being, however,
when the mainspring was
invented about 1470. This

1513

was a spiral spring that
could be wound tightly, so
that its tendency to unwind
would then power the
clock.

A German locksmith,
Peter Henlein, realized that
a mainspring would work
just as well when it was
small as when it was large,
and since it didn’t depend
on gravity, it could work in
any position. About 1504,
therefore, he placed a small

mainspring in a clock small
enough to be carried about
in a pocket.

Such a small clock was
called a watch, because sail-
ors or others who had to
maintain a watch at sea or
elsewhere for a fixed period
of time would find it useful.
The original watches had
hour hands only and were
not particularly accurate,
but better things were to
come.

 

South Sea

Columbus had reached the
coast of what we now call
the Isthmus of Panama in
his final voyage, and Span-
ish settlers arrived soon
after. One of the leading set-
tlers was Vasco Nufiez de
Balboa (1475-1519).

At that time, those
Spaniards who thought
they were in Asia kept look-
ing for the vast wealth that
Marco Polo had talked
about, and gold was a par-
ticularly concentrated form
of wealth, one they particu-
larly lusted for. After all,
since the people who lived
in these continents

(whether Asians or not)
were not Christian, any
gold they possessed would
rightly belong to any Chris-
tians who cared to help
themselves to it.

Balboa heard rumors
of gold to the west and he
organized an expedition to
find it. Panama, however, is
a narrow isthmus and you
can't wander far in it with-
out striking the other coast.
Balboa's expedition left on
September 1, 1513, and on
September 25, he climbed a
hill and found himself star-
ing at the limitless expanse
of what seemed to be an
ocean. Since the coasts of
Panama run east-west and

the Atlantic Ocean is on the
north shore, Balboa named
the new ocean on the south
shore the South Sea.

Balboa probably did
not realize that this was the
second ocean Vespucius
had referred to, the one
that lay between the Ameri-
can continents and Asia—
but it was.

Florida

Puerto Rico (rich port) had
been discovered in 1492 in
the course of Columbus’s
first voyage, and he had left
some men behind when he
returned to Spain. When he
reached Puerto Rico on his
