  

this idea would create enor-
mous controversy, and
being a gentle person who
could not bear to partici-
pate in such controversy,
he spent some twenty years
gathering evidence for his
point of view, hoping that
when he did publish, the ev-
idence would be so over-
whelming that it would
preclude argument. (In this
he was naive, for he did not
count on the strength with
which human beings can
turn away from facts and
cling to superstition.)

In 1858 another British
biologist, Alfred Russel
Wallace (1823-1913), was
in the East Indies. He too
had read Malthus and ar-
rived at the notion of evolu-
tion by natural selection.
Unhampered by Darwin’s
fear of controversy, Wallace
wrote up his theories in
three days. Then, in order
that his views might be
checked by an approriate
expert, he sent his eleven-
page paper to Darwin, who
could scarcely believe his
eyes when he saw himself
so anticipated.

There was nothing for
Darwin to do but to suggest
a joint publication and this
was carried through imme-
diately. In the next year,
1859, Darwin reluctantly
published a book, best
known as The Origin of Spe-
cies, in which he presented
his theory in detail (but not
in as much detail as he

would have liked, for he
had been planning a book
five times as long at least).

Darwin’s book was the
most notable scientific
work since Newton's great
classic (see 1687). It was
the foundation of a new bi-
ology, as Newton's had
been the foundation of a
new physics. It changed the
very current of people’s
thinking, and the world has
never been the same.

Organic
Molecular
Structure

Up to this point, organic
molecules were still charac-
terized by the number of
atoms of each element that
were present. Even when it
was understood that in iso-
mers the same number of
the same sorts of atoms
must be arranged differ-
ently, it was not clear what
the difference in arrange-
ment might be.

However, Frankland’s
notion of valence (see 1852)
offered an important han-
dle, which the German
chemist Friedrich August
Kekule von Stradonitz
(1829—1896) made use of.
He pointed out that since
hydrogen had a valence of
1, oxygen of 2, nitrogen of
3, and carbon of 4, this
meant that each hydrogen
atom could be attached to
other atoms by means of a

single "hook," each oxygen
by means of two "“hooks,”
each nitrogen by means of
three, and each carbon by
means of four.

A British chemist,
Archibald Scott Couper
(1831-1892), working inde-
pendently, suggested that
each atom have its valence
indicated by dashes. Thus,
the hydrogen molecule, the
oxygen molecule, and the
nitrogen molecule would be
written H—H, 0=0, and
N=N. Water would be
H—O—H, carbon dioxide
would be 0=C=0, and so
on.

Kekule's second great
point was that carbon
atoms could hook onto each
other freely, so that mole-
cules might be made up of
chains of carbon atoms,
with other atoms latching
onto the valence bonds not
taken up by the formation
of those chains.

This system finally
made sense of many oi-
ganic molecules. The differ-
ent arrangements of
isomers could often be
worked out, and a great
deal of the mystery of or-
ganic chemistry vanished.
