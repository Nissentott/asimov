 

(1610-1685), was puzzled
at the fact that he kept los-
ing money in a certain
game of dice, which he felt
he ought to win. In 1654 he
consulted Pascal (see 1642)
on the matter, who in turn
consulted Fermat (see
1637). Pascal and Fermat
worked out mathematical
techniques for judging the
likelihood of certain combi-
nations appearing in the
fall of (honest) dice. In
doing so, they laid the foun-
dations for the theory of
probability.

The chief function of
probability was to deal
with large numbers of
events, which singly were
random in nature but in
total were predictable. As
time went on, considera-
tions of probability proved

1656

to be almost inconceivably
important in the develop-
ment of science.

Air Pressure

Guericke, having invented
the air pump (see 1645),
used it to demonstrate the
power of air pressure, be-
ginning in 1654.

For instance, he affixed
a rope to a piston and had
fifty men pull on the rope
while he slowly created a
vacuum on the other side of
the piston within the cylin-
der. Air pressure inexorably
pushed the piston into the
cylinder despite the strug-
gles of the fifty men to pre-
vent it.

Then he prepared two
metal hemispheres that fit-
ted together along a

10

greased flange. (They were
called Magdeburg hemi-
spheres because Guericke
was mayor of Magdeburg.)
When the hemispheres
were put together and the
air within them evacuated,
air pressure held them to-
gether even though teams
of horses were attached to
the separate hemispheres,
straining to their utmost in
opposite directions. When
air was allowed to enter the
joined hemispheres, they
fell apart of themselves.
This demonstration
took place before the eyes
of Ferdinand IIT (1608—
1657), who became Holy
Roman Emperor in 1637.
He was so impressed, he or-
dered Guericke's work to be
written up and published.

 

Saturn’s Ring

Galileo had observed Sa-
turn through his telescope
in 1612 and noted some-
thing odd about it. There
seemed to be projections on
either side. He could not
quite make them out, and
after a while they disap-
peared. It annoyed Galileo.
After all, he had been at-
tacked by religionists who
said that his telescope pro-
duced optical illusions, and
here was one case where

perhaps it did. He refused
to look at Saturn again.

In 1655, however, the
Dutch astronomer Chris-
tiaan Huygens (1629-1695),
with the help of a Dutch
philosopher and optician,
Benedict Spinoza (1632—
1677), worked out a new
and better method for
grinding lenses. He in-
stalled his improved lenses
in a telescope that was 23
feet long, and with that he
studied Saturn in 1656.

He could see what it

was that had puzzled Gali-
leo. Saturn was surrounded
by a thin, broad ring that
did not touch the planet at
any point. No other object
in the sky had so peculiar a
structure, and Saturn is
widely considered the most
beautiful object in the sky
because of it.

In addition, he discov-
ered that Saturn had a sal-
ellite, which he named
Titan (because Saturn, or
Cronos as the Greeks called
him, was the leader of a
