so obtained could be ex-
tracted and made to stimu-
late another heart directly,
without the intervention of
nerve activity, came to
Loewi at 3 A.M. one night.
He jotted down notes and
went back to sleep but in
the morning had forgotten
the details and couldn't
read his own writing. When
the following night the
same idea occurred to him,
he took no chances. He
went to the laboratory and
got to work, By 5 A.M. he
had proved his point.

Loewi called the sub-
stance Vagusstoffe (German
for “vagus material”’). Dale,
who had discovered acetyl-
choline a few years before
(see 1914), recognized that
its effects were similar to
those described by Loewi
and suggested that Vaguss-
toffe was acetylcholine. So
it was, and Loewi shared
the Nobel Prize for medi-
cine and physiology with
Dale in 1936.

Rickets

By now McCollum had dis-
tinguished between fat-sol-
uble vitamin A and water-
soluble vitamin B (see
1913). Vitamin C, the anti-
scurvy factor, was also wa-
ter-soluble but had no
effect on beriberi and was
therefore a substance differ-
ent from vitamin B.

The disease of rickets,
thought to be a vitamin-de-
ficiency disease at this
time, was not affected by
any of these three vitamins.
The British biochemist Ed-
ward Mellanby (1884—
1955) undertook to track
down some additional vita-
min that might be in-
volved.

By 1921 he had located
a rickets-inhibiting sub-
stance in such animal fats
as cod-liver oil, butter, and
suet. The vitamin was fat-
soluble, but its distribution
was not that of vitamin A,
and its absence did not pro-
duce the symptoms that ab-
sence of vitamin A did.
Clearly, then, there were
two fat-soluble vitamins,
and the rickets-inhibiting
one was labeled vitamin D.

Also in 1921, other re-
searchers discovered that
sunshine had a rickets-in-
hibiting effect. Sunshine it-
self couldn’t contain a
vitamin, but it might con-
vert some substance in skin
into a vitamin. This, in fact,
turned out to be the case.

Glutathione

In 1921 Hopkins (see 1900,
Tryptophan) isolated gluta-
thione from tissues. It is a
combination of three amino
acids (a tripeptide) and
switches easily between a
reduced and oxidized state.
That is, it can easily be

made either to give up a
pair of hydrogen atoms or
to take them up again.
Hopkins demonstrated
this ability on the part of
glutathione and argued for
its importance in tissue
chemistry. First, such com-
pounds can act as protec-
tors for delicate
compounds. By giving up
their hydrogen atoms
readily, they make it unnec-
essary for other compounds
to give up theirs when that
loss might do some damage
harder to repair. Also, by
bouncing back and forth be-
tween the two states, gluta-
thione (and other such
compounds) can bring
about the easy transfer of
atomic groupings from one
substance to another.

Magnetrons

By this time, many differ-
ent varieties of radio tubes
were being developed. In
1921 the American physi-
cist Albert Wallace Hull
(1880-1966) developed a
diode (see 1904) that could
produce bursts of short
radio waves (microwaves) of
high intensity. He called it
a magnetron, because an ex-
ternal magnet was used to
apply a magnetic field to the
electrodes inside the tube.
In the next decade,
tubes of this sort played a
key role in the development
of radar.
