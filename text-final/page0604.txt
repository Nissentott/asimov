Solar Energy
Source

Gamow had suggested that
hydrogen fusion was the
source of the Sun's energy
(see 1929) but could not
supply the details.

By 1938, however,
much had been learned
about nuclear reactions—
the energy they delivered
and the speed with which
they took place—from ex-
periments in the labora-
tory. This, together with
reasonable estimates of the

pressures and temperatures
deep in the Sun's core, en-
abled the German-born
American physicist Hans
Albrecht Bethe (b. 1906) to
outline in detail the mecha-
nism by which hydrogen fu-
sion could take place in the
Sun'’s core. (The German as-
tronomer Carl Friedrich
Weizsacker [b. 1912] inde-
pendently advanced similar
ideas at about the same
time.) For the first time, a
suitable answer was given
to Helmholtz's question
about the source of the
Sun’s energy (see 1853).

For this, and for other
work in nuclear physics,
Bethe was awarded the
Nobel Prize for physics in
1967.

Magnetic
Resonance

The Austrian-born Ameri-
can physicist Isidor Isaac
Rabi (1898—1988) contin-
ued the work of Stern on
molecular beams (see
1933). Rabi, in 1938, devel-
oped the technique of mag-
netic resonance whereby it
