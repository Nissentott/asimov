Archeopteryx

Although the giant dino-
saurs, whose fossil relics
had been dug up over the
past forty years, were the
most dramatic remnants of
ancient life, the most im-
portant single fossil was
not a giant, but a relatively
small lizardlike animal
that was discovered in

1861. It is estimated now to
be about 140 million years
old.

1t left a clear impres-
sion in a rock, which
showed that it had a head
possessing teeth and no
beak, a long neck, a long
tail, and a flat breastbone—
all very lizardlike. There
was, however, one all-
important added feature.
The “lizard” had feathers.
The imprints of those feath-
ers are unmistakable. They
are in a double row down
the length of the tail and
are also present along the
forelimbs.

In the world today,
every known bird has feath-
ers, and no living thing that
is not a bird has them.
Therefore, it is necessary to
think of this fossil as repre-

senting a very primitive
bird. It is called archeop-
teryx (from Greek words
meaning “‘ancient wing’’).

The archeopteryx is the
best-known example of an
ancient life form that seems
to lie exactly between two
major groups of today’s life
forms. It is half reptile and
half bird and is therefore a
perfect example of a reptile
in the process of becoming
a bird. No other fossil dis-
covered before or since is
such a clear example of evo-
lution at work.

 

Broca’s
Convolution

Gall had been of the opin-
ion that different parts of
the brain controlled differ-
ent parts and functions of
the body (see 1810). Gall's
conclusions were strictly
speculative, however. The
first person to present con-
clusive evidence of a spe-
cific region of the brain in
charge of a specific function
was Broca (see 1856).
Broca had a fifty-one-
year-old patient who had
lost the ability to speak.

When the patient died in
1861, a postmortem re-
vealed damage to the third
convolution on the left fron-
tal lobe of the cerebrum
(now known as Broca's con-
volution). Gall’s insight,
which had been misdi-
rected into phrenology, was
thus put right.

Thallium

Kirchhoff (see 1859) was
not the only one to discover
new elements by means of
spectroscopy. The British
physicist William Crookes
(1832-1919) was working
with selenium ores, and in
1861 he came upon a sam-
ple of such ore that when
heated showed a bright
green line characteristic of
no known element. He ana-
lyzed the ore in search of
the new element, found it,
and named it thallium,
from the Greek word for
“green twig' after the color
of its line.
