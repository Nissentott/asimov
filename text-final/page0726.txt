Life on Mars

In 1975 two Mars probes
had been launched by the
United States, Viking 1 on
August 20 and Viking 2 on
September 9. Both went
into orbit about Mars in
mid-1976, and they took
the best photographs of the
Martian surface yet.

On July 20, 1976, Vik-
ing I came down to the Mar-
tian surface at what would
have been, on Earth, the
edge of the tropical zone
Some weeks later Viking 2
came down in a more north-
erly position. In coming
down, they discovered that
the Martian atmosphere,
though chiefly carbon diox-

 

 

ide, was also 2.7 percent ni-
trogen and 1.6 percent
argon.

The Martian surface
was rocky, as Earth'’s sur-
face is. The Martian sur-
face, however, was richer in
iron and sulfur and poorer
in aluminum, sodium, and
potassium. There was no
sign of life on Mars on a
scale visible to the eye.

The Viking probes were
equipped to run experi-
ments on Martian soil to
see if any microscopic
forms of life were present.
The experiments were car-
ried through with ambigu-
ous results, but there was
no trace of organic material
in the soil, and this led as-

tronomers to believe that
certain lifelike responses to
the experiments were the
result of some odd chemi-
cal behavior of the soil.

There were signs of dry
riverbeds, however, com-
plete with tributaries. It
may be that in ages past
there was a reasonable sup-
ply of liquid water on Mars.
If so, where did it go, and
what led to such an ex-
treme cooling of the
planet?

Pluto’s Surface

Pluto is a small planet, and
it is ordinarily the most dis-
tant planet from the Sun by
far. At perihelion, however,
