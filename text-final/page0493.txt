carbon dioxide, but as time
goes on, the level of activity
drops off. The natural as-
sumption was that the en-
zyme broke down with
time.

In 1905, however,
Harden showed that this
could not be so. If he added
inorganic phosphate to the
solution, the enzyme went
back to work as hard as
ever. This was a strange
finding, for neither the
sugar being fermented, nor
the alcohol and carbon di-
oxide produced, nor the en-
zyme itself contained
phosphorus.

Since the inorganic
phosphate disappeared,
Harden searched for some
organic phosphate formed
from it, which he located in
the form of a sugar mole-
cule to which two phos-
phate groups had become
attached. This sugar phos-
phate was formed in the
course of fermentation;
then, after other reactions
had taken place, the phos-
phate groups were removed
again. The sugar phosphate
was a metabolic intermedi-
ate. Harden was the first to
isolate such a metabolic in-
termediate, but other bio-
chemists were soon hot on
the trail of such things.

Harden was also the
first to indicate the im-
portant role that phosphate
groups play in metabolism.
For this work, he was

awarded a share of the
Nobel Prize in chemistry in
1929.

Hormones

Starling, who had shared in
the discovery of secretin
(see 1902), suggested the
name hormone in 1905. He
also suggested that other
hormones would be found
to exist and that they were
produced by various small
glands in the body. In this
he proved to be quite cor-
rect.

Linkage of
Characteristics

When Mendel had studied
his pea plants (see 1865), he
had followed the course of
seven characteristics and
found them all to be inher-
ited independently. It was
natural to suppose, there-
fore, that every characteris-
tic had its own factors,
which all reached the fertil-
ized egg cell independently.
‘When Sutton pointed
out that the chromosomes
were Mendel’s factors, how-
ever (see 1902), there was a
problem: there weren't
enough different chromo-
somes to account for all in-
herited characteristics.
Bateson, who first ap-
plied the laws of heredity
to animals (see 1902),
pointed out that indeed not

all characteristics were in-
dependently inherited—
some were transmitted to-
gether—so it might be sup-
posed that a single
chromosome contained
more than one factor, per-
haps many more than one
factor. It might be that
Mendel, by pure chance,
had chosen seven factors
that were each on a differ-
ent chromosome.

The thought that a
chromosome was not a fac-
tor but a collection of fac-
tors was a crucial one in
the development of genet-
ics. (It was Bateson, inci-
dentally, who introduced
the term genetics.)

High Pressure

Quite early, human beings
learned how to produce
temperatures considerably
higher than normal. Pro-
ducing high pressures was
a more difficult task.

The American physicist
Percy Williams Bridgman
(1882—-1961), while a doc-
toral student, wanted to
work with high pressures
but found his equipment in-
adequate. In 1905, there-
fore, he turned to the
problem of devising better
high-pressure apparatus.
He designed seals that
squeezed more tightly to-
gether as the pressure in-
creased so that there would
be no leakage, and he
