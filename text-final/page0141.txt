Microscopes

It must have dawned on
people rather early that
there were ways of making
small objects appear larger
in size. Dewdrops on a leaf
or on a blade of grass will
make the surface they rest
on look larger. Spheres of
glass will do the same.

The people who would
most notice this sort of

1591

thing and be most con-
cerned with it were the
spectacle-makers, since the
convex lenses used to cor-
rect far-sightedness acted
to magnify objects.

The spectacle-making
industry was most ad-
vanced in the Netherlands
at this time. It occurred to
a Dutch spectacle-maker,
Zacharias Janssen (1580-
ca. 1638), that if one lens

magnified somewhat, two
would magnify to a greater
extent. He placed a convex
lens at each end of a tube
and found that magnifica-
tion was indeed improved.
The improvement wasn't
great, but Janssen’s tube
can be viewed as the first
microscope, and its descen-
dants were to revolutionize
biology.

 

Algebraic
Symbols

Until now, mathematicians
had described quantities,
relationships, and prob-
lems in words (it seemed
the only way), and what
they described was often
hard to envisage.

Vieta (see 1589, Crypt-

1592

analysis) began to symbol-
ize constants and un-
knowns by letters of the
alphabet, the now familiar
x’s and y's of algebra. In
1591, he wrote a book
about algebra that was the
first a present-day high-
school student would recog-
nize at a glance to be deal-
ing with that subject.

The progression from

words to symbols was to
mathematics something
like the progression from
ideographs to letters in or-
dinary writing, or from
Roman numerals to Arabic
numerals in arithmetical
computation.

 

Thermometer

The concept of hot and cold
must be as old as human-
ity. We can all tell when an

object is hot or cold by plac-
ing the hand near it (not
even necessarily on it). We
can also tell if one subject
is substantially warmer

than another. Such subjec-
tive sensations are useless,
however, where small dif-
ferences in temperature are
concerned and are, in any
