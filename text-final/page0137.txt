days long is about 365700
days long. This means that
there should be only 97
leap years every 400 years,
not 100. By the Julian calen-
dar, 3 days too many were
added every 400 years, and
the vernal equinox fell ear-
lier and earlier. If the ver-
nal equinox was on March
21 when the Julian calen-
dar was established, then
by 1582 it would fall on
March 11, 10 days too
early

The Church was very
involved in this because the
holy days depended on the
calendar, and if the drift
continued, Easter would
