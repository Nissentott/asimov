94, which was named pluio-
nium, for the planet Pluto.
In this part of the work, the
American physicist Glenn
Theodore Seaborg (b. 1912)
was prominent.

Neptunium and pluto-
nium were the first of the
transuranium elements to be
discovered. There would be
others.

Seaborg recognized
that the transuranium ele-
ments were part of a series
analogous to the rare earth
elements. There were fif-
teen elements running from
lanthanum (number 57) to
lutetium (number 71) inclu-
sive (with number 61 still
undiscovered), and they
were now called the lan-
thanides after the first mem-
ber. The second group
would be the fifteen ele-
ments running from actin-
ium (number 89) to
element number 103 inclu-
sive, and they were named
the actinides. Six of the ac-
tinides were now known,
and nine remained to be
discovered.

For their work on trans-
uranium elements, McMil-
lan and Seaborg were
awarded the Nobel Prize
for chemistry in 1951.

Uranium
Hexafluoride

One of the problems in pre-
paring a nuclear bomb was
that only uranium-235

 

would participate in a
slow-neutron nuclear chain
reaction, but uranium-238
was present to the extent of
140 atoms for every atom of
uranium-235. The uranium-
238 atoms would absorb
neutrons and undergo reac-
tions other than fission,
which dampened and even
aborted the chain reaction.

It would be necessary
to prepare enriched ura-
nium, with a larger percent-
age of the uranium-235
atoms. Separating two iso-
topes is difficult, however.
If uranium were a gas,
which could be made to
pass through long narrow
passages, or very fine holes,
the uranium-235, being
lighter by 1.26 percent,
would move a little faster,
so that the first sample to
arrive at the other end
would be slightly richer in
uranium-235 than the natu-
ral element would be. If
this was done over and over
(gaseous diffusion), satisfac-
torily enriched uranium
would result. But uranium
is not a gas.

In 1940 Abelson, who
was helping to isolate nep-
tunium (see above), sug-
gested that uranium
hexafluoride, with each
molecule made up of one
uranium atom and six fluo-
rine atoms, was a liquid
that was easily evaporated,
and the vapors might then
be made to pass through
tubes or holes.

Uranium hexafluoride
containing a uranium-235
atom had a molecular
weight of 349 compared to
352 for uranium hexafluo-
ride with a uranium-238
atom. The difference in
weight is nearly 1 percent,
and that was enough. Gas-
eous diffusion sufficed to
produce enriched uranium.

Astatine

In 1940 Segre, who had iso-
lated technetium (see
1937), bombarded bismuth
(element number 83) with
alpha particles. If an alpha
particle struck the bismuth
and remained, or even if a
neutron were emitted there-
after, the bismuth would
have gained two protons
and the result would be the
undiscovered element num-
ber 85. This was accom-
plished in 1940, but World
War II interrupted, and it
wasn't until the war was
over that they could con-
firm their finding.

The new element was
quite unstable. Its most
long-lived isotope had a
hall-life of only 8.3 hours. It
was therefore named asta-
tine, from the Greek word
for “unstable.” It belonged
ta the same group as fluo-
rine, chlorine, bromine,
and iodine, which is why it
received the -ine ending.

With the discovery of
astatine, only one gap re-
mained in the entire peri-
