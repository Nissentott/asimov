lost dreaming.

It would seem, then,
that dreaming has some
important function in
maintaining the working
efficiency of the complex
human brain. In this con-
nection, REM sleep has
been found to oceur in in-
fants to an even greater
extent than in older individ-
uals and to occur in mam-
mals other than human
beings, too. Exactly what
the function of REM sleep
and dreaming might be re-
mains a matter of dispute,
however.

Tranquilizers

Sedatives are obviously use-
ful drugs for quieting over-
excited states and for
inducing calm. The best-
known sedatives prior to
the 1950s were the barbitu-
rates, but they diminished
alertness and produced
sleep.

In 1952 the American
physician Robert Wallace
Wilkins (b. 1906) studied a
drug, reserpine, obtained
from the root of an Indian
shrub. He reported that it
had a sedative effect with-
out diminishing alertness
or inducing sleep.

Reserpine and other
drugs of its nature came to

 

be called tranquilizers. They
grew instantly popular
with many people for use in
the reduction (real or fan-
cied) of tensions (real or fan-
cied). They served, more
seriously, as adjuncts to
psychiatric treatment, for
although they are in no
sense a cure for any men-
tal disease, they do calm
violent patients without
the use of harsh physical
restraints, and calm
patients may then more
easily cooperate with the
psychiatrist.

Gas
Chromatography

In 1952 A. J. P. Martin, who
had helped evolve the tech-
nique of paper chromatog-
raphy (see 1944), applied
its principles to the separa-
tion of gases.

In his new technique,
mixtures of gases or vapors
were passed through a lig-
uid solvent or over an ad-
sorbing solid (that is, one to
which gas molecules tend
to cling) by means of a cur-
rent of inert carrier gas,
such as nitrogen or helium.
The components of the gas
mixture were pushed along
with the carrier gas at dif-
ferent speeds, so that the
carrier arrived at the other

end with the components of
the gas mixture separated.
Such gas chromatography is
particularly useful because
of the speed of its separa-
tions and the great delicacy
with which it can detect
trace impurities.

Zone Refining

The American chemist Wil-
liam Gardner Pfann intro-
duced the technique of zone
refining in 1952, This calls
for a rod, of germanium or
silicon, for instance, placed
within a circular heating el-
ement. The section of the
rod that is enclosed softens
and begins to melt, and as
the rod is drawn through
the hollow, the softened
zone moves along its
length. Any impurities in
the rod tend to remain in
the softened zone, so that
they are washed to the end
of the rod. After a few pas-
ses of this sort, the end can
be cut off and what re-
mains is unprecedentedly
pure.

This is a most useful
technique in preparing
pure material that can then
be “doped” with trace
quantities of deliberately
chosen impurities in con-
centrations suitable for
solid-state electronic de-
vices such as computers.
