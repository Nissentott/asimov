ity as needed and in vary-
ing amounts as lights were
switched on and off. He ac-
complished that, too.

The age of electric
lighting had come, and the
dark of night was on the
road to vanishing.

Origin of the
Moon

Newton had thought that
tides were the result of
gravitational attraction by
the Moon. The British as-
tronomer George Howard
Darwin (1845-1912), the
second son of Charles Dar-
win, went into the matter
with particular care.

He realized that the
flow of water around the
Earth as it turned swept
that water across shallow
arms of the seas and up
sloping shorelines. This pro-
duced a certain friction and
converted some of the en-
ergy of Earth’s rotatory mo-
tion into heat.

This meant that
Earth'’s rotation was slow-
ing and its period of rota-
tion (the length of the day)
was lengthening at a very
slow rate. That meant, in
turn, that some of the
Earth's angular momentum
was disappearing. How-
ever, the angular momen-
tum could not disappear
into nothingness, for there
was a law of conservation

 

of angular momentum. If
the Earth lost some, then it
seemed most likely that the
Moon would have to gain
just the amount Earth lost.
The simplest way for the
Moon to gain the angular
momentum was for it to
move very slowly away
from the Earth.

If this seenario were
played backward in time,
we would see the Moon
coming closer and closer to
Earth and Earth’s day
growing shorter and
shorter.

George Darwin sug-
gested that the Moon was
once part of the Earth, in
fact, and because Earth
was spinning very rapidly
in primordial times, part of
its outermost region
whirled off and became the
Moon.

Although this sugges-
tion is not accepted today,
it was very dramatic and in-
teresting in its time.

Saccharin

Discoveries can be made en-
tirely by accident. In 1879
the American chemist Ira
Remsen (1846—1927) and a
student of his, Constantine
Fahlberg, synthesized a
compound named ortho-
benzoyl sulfimide. Ordi-
narily it would have ended
there, for new organic com-
pounds are manufactured
endlessly every year. This

time, however, Fahlberg
happened to put his fingers
to his mouth without know-
ing that a few grains of the
new compound had ad-
hered to them. He was as-
tonished by an intensely
Sweet taste.

The compound was
eventually named saccha-
rin (from a Latin word for
“sweet”'). It was the first of
the commercial sugar sub-
stitutes and is still a major
one today.

Scandium

Since Gadolin had discov-
ered the rare earths (see
1794), about a dozen ele-
ments had been extracted
from them that all closely
resembled each other. An el-
ement that was not exactly
one of the rare earth series,
but that rather resembled
them in its properties, was
discovered in 1879 by the
Swedish chemist Lars Fre-
drik Nilson (1840—1899).
He named it scandium, for
Scandinavia.

The Swedish chemist
Per Teodor Cleve (1840—
1905) pointed out soon af-
terward that its properties
were exactly those of Men-
deleyev's “eka-boron” (see
1869) and that it fit into the
periodic table just where
eka-boron had been placed.
A second of Mendeleyev's
predicted elements had
thus been discovered.
