Gilgamesh

The last great king of the As-
syrian Empire had been
Ashurbanipal (see 2500
B.C.). He had patronized art
and literature and had es-
tablished a large library in
his capital city of Nineveh
(probably the largest before
the time of the Greeks).

In the 1860s, British ar-
chaeologists excavated the
site of ruined Nineveh
(which had been destroyed
fourteen years after Ashur-
banipal’s death) and
brought cuneiform tablets
from the ruins of the li-
brary to the British Mu-
seum. There, the English
archaeologist George Smith

(1840-1876), who was an
expert at reading cunei-
form languages thanks to
the work of Rawlinson (see
1846), was startled to read
on one tablet the tale of a
flood, much as it appeared
in the Bible.

He announced his re-
sults in 1872. He had
ered the epic of Gilgamesh
the oldest surviving literary
product of humanity, and it
contained a llood story that
the Biblical writers had ob-
viously used as a source
This made a huge sensa-
tion, and following, as it
did, hard upon the discov
ery of Troy, it further in-

creased popular interest in

Bacteriology

Bacteria had been known
for two centuries but were
so small that till now they
had not been studied in de-
tail. Pasteur’s germ theory
of disease (see 1862), how-
ever, had brought them
into lurid prominence. It
turned out that a number
of different bacteria were
