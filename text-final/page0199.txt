Gas
Volume and
Temperature

icist Guil-

The French pt
laume Amontons (1663—

1705) devised an air ther-
mometer that was different
from Galileo’s (see 1592),
for it measured tempera-
ture by the change in gas
pressure rather than by the

change in gas volume. He
used the thermometer to
show that a liquid such as
water always boiled at the
same temperature. Thi
made it possible to use the
temperature at which
water boiled as a standard
reference.

With his new thermom-
eter, Amontons tested the
volume of a fixed quantity
of gas at different tempera-

 

 

tures and, in 1 , showed
that the volume inc
at a steady rate as th
perature went up and de-
creased at the same steady
rate as the temperatur
went down. Much more im-
portant, he showed that for
he studied, the vol-
ume change with tempera-
ture was the same. It
seemed a property of all

gases.
