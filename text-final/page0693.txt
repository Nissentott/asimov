1962

 

American in
Space

On February 20, 1962, the
United States launched
Friendship 7, which placed
the first American in orbit.
He was John Herschel
Glenn, Jr. (b. 1921), who or-
bited the Earth three times
and remained in space for 5
hours.

Communications
Satellites

Echo I (see 1961) could
function as a passive com-
munications satellite, since
a radio beam could be
aimed at it and the reflec-
tion would then reach
Earth at a widely different
spot. The reflection was too
feeble to serve as anything
more than a demonstration
that it could be done, how-
ever,

On July 10, 1962, the
United States launched Tel-
star I. It was a true commu-
nications satellite since it
not only received radio
waves but amplified them
before sending them on.
Thanks to Telstar I and to
the numerous communica-
tions satellites that fol-

 

lowed, it became possible
to communicate easily, and
in seconds, across conti-
nents and oceans. Commu-
nication capability is now
truly global, and Earth is,
in that respect, literally a
global village.

Venus Probe

In the first five years of the
Space Age, the Earth and
the Moon had been the only
targets. In 1962 the age of
planetary probes—rockets
designed to pass near other
planets and send back infor-
mation concerning them—
was reached.

The first successful
planetary probe was Mari-
ner 2, launched by the
United States on August 27,
1962. It was designed to ap-
proach the planet Venus,
which comes closer to
Earth than any other
planet. Mariner 2 was there-
fore a Venus probe, and it
passed within 22,000 miles
of Venus's cloud layer on
December 14, 1962.

In the course of its trip,
Mariner 2 sent back irrefut-
able evidence of the exis-
tence of a solar wind (see
1959). 1t also detected the
microwave radiation of the
planet and showed defi-

nitely that its surface tem-
perature was something
like 475° C, hot enough to
melt tin and lead and to
boil mercury.

Rotation of
Venus

Although Venus ap-
proached Earth more
closely than any other
planet did, its period of ro-
tation had remained myste-
rious. This was ironic, since
the periods of rotation of
other planets, even that of
far distant Pluto (see 1955),
were known. The reason for
this was that Venus'’s thick
and featureless cloud layer
precluded any pessibility of
seeing its surface and de-
tecting features that could
be spotted as moving
around the planet.

Yet although light
waves could not penetrate
the clouds, microwaves
could. Furthermore, if a
beam of microwaves is re-
flected from an object mov-
ing at right angles to the
beam (as would be true of
Venus if it were rotating),
then the wavelength of the
beam is broadened and dis-
torted. From the extent of
the distortion, the speed of
