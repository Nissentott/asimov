very reluctant publisher. (A
friend of Lagrange had to
guarantee his purchase of
any unsold copies.) It
turned out to be a classic of
science, although (as La-
grange boasted) there was
not one geometric diagram
in it. Geometry remains im-
portant, but Lagrange
helped free the world of sci-
ence from its unnecessary
tyranny.

Affinities

Chemists up to this time
had to take chemical reac-
tions as they found them.
Substance A would react

with substance B but not
with substance C and that
was all there was to it.

The Swedish mineralo-
gist Torbern Olof Berg-
mann (1735—1784) had
struggled to classify miner-
als and to make sense out
of chemical reactions. He
listed affinities—that is, the
extent to which different
chemicals interacted. He
also prepared tables that
made some sense out of the
matter and helped predict
whether certain reactions,
not yet observed, would
take place or not if given a
chance.

His results were pub-

 

 

lished posthumously in
1788, and while they repre-
sented the barest beginning
in the study of chemical be-
havior, they were a begin-
ning.

 

 

Satellites

By the end of the 1600s, ten
satellites were known:
Earth’s moon, the four sat-
ellites of Jupiter discovered
by Galileo (see 1610), and

the five satellites of Saturn
discovered by Huygens (see
1656) and Cassini (see
1665).

A century had passed
after Cassini’s discovery of
Dione in 1684 without any

 

further satellite discoveries.
Then in 1787, Herschel dis-
covered two satellites of his
own planet, Uranus (see
1781). He named them Tita-
nia and Oberon, after the
queen and king of the fair-
