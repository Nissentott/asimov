Speed of Light

Roemer and Bradley had
both determined the speed
of light by astronomical
methods (see 1675 and
1728). But until 1849 no
one had been able to deter-
mine the speed of light by
setting up an earthbound
experiment. In that year,
Fizeau (see 1848) set up a
rapidly turning toothed
disk on one hilltop and a
mirror on another, 5 miles
away, Light passed through
a gap between the teeth of
the disk to the mirror and
was reflected. By that time,
a tooth had moved into the
way and the reflection
could not be seen. If the
disk turned rapidly enough,

the reflected light passed
through the next gap and
could be seen again. From
the speed of revolution re-
quired for the reflection to
become visible, the time re-
quired for light to travel 10
miles could be calculated.
Fizeau'’s assistant, the
French physicist Jean-Ber-
nard-Léon Foucault (1819~
1868), improved the tech-
nique the next year. Instead
of using a toothed wheel,
Foucault used two mirrors,
one of which was rotating
rapidly. Light would be re-
flected from the stationary
mirror to the rotating one.
The rotating mirror would
have turned slightly in the
time it took light to travel
to it and would reflect that

light slightly to one side as
a result. From the amount
of deflection, the speed of
light could be calculated.
Foucault's best figure for
the speed of light was
185,000 miles per second. It
was lower than the true
value, but only by about 0.7
percent.

Foucault's method was
so delicate that he only
needed to let the light
travel 66 feet. With only
that distance to worry
about, he could have it
travel through water, and
did. He found out that,
through water, light trav-
eled at only three-fourths
its velocity through air. It
turned out that the speed of
light through any transpar-
