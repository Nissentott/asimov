(Eclipse is from Greek
words meaning “to leave
out,” since when one hap-
pened, the Sun or the Moon
would seem to be left out of
the sky.)

An eclipse is a frighten-
ing spectacle. Those who
become aware of it may ac-
tually think that the Sun or
the Moon is dying, with in-
calculable consequences.
Even if it is understood
that the Sun or Moon is
only obscured temporarily,
there is a feeling that it is
an omen of evil sent by the
gods as a warning.

Thales (see 585 B.c.) was
the first to ask himself what
the Universe was made of
and to seek an answer that
did not depend on gods or
the supernatural. He thus

  

 

However, by studying
the movements of the Sun
and Moon, early astrono-
mers learned to predict
when eclipses would take
place. Since that made the
eclipses appear to be auto-
matic and unavoidable phe-
nomena, it removed their
unexpected and ominous
connotations. (There is
some feeling that even pre-
historic watchers of the sky
learned to tell when lunar
eclipses would occur, and
that the stones at Stone-
henge in southwestern En-
gland were arranged as a
kind of observatory that al-

represents the birth of ratio-
nalism.

His answer, which he
may have reached about
580 B.c., was that all matter
was fundamentally water,
and that everything that
did not seem to be water

lowed prediction of such
phenomena.)

The Greek philosopher
Thales (624-546 B.c.) seems
to have learned the Babylo-
nian methods and pre-
dicted an eclipse of the
Sun, one that we now know
(by calculating backward)
took place on May 28, 585
B.c. This added greatly to
Thales’ prestige and also
helped make eclipses less
frightening, since they were
demonstrated to be predict-
able.

  

originated in water or was
modified water. Water was
thus, in his opinion, the pri-
mary element (from a Latin
word of uncertain mean-
ing), or fundamental sub-
stance, of the Earth.
