Oxygen
Isotopes and
Atomic Weights

Aston’s work with the iso-
topes of stable elements
(see 1925) had not uncov-
ered them all. In 1929
Giauque (see 1925) found
that of every 10,000 oxygen
atoms, 9,976 indeed had a
mass of 16, which was the
atomic weight of oxygen.
This very common isotope
was therefore called oxy-
gen-16. However, of the re-
maining 24 atoms, 4 had a
mass of 17 and 20 a mass of
18. These were called oxy-
gen-17 and oxygen-18.

This was upsetting
news, since oxygen atoms
had been used for a century
as the standard against
which atomic weights
could be determined. If oxy-
gen was a mixture of iso-
topes, with the mixture
varying a bit (perhaps)
from place to place and
from time to time, it
wouldn't serve as a stan-
dard. There were sugges-
tions that oxygen-16 be
used as a standard, even
though that meant that all
atomic weights would have
to be slightly altered. Even-
tually, the commonest iso-
tope of carbon, carbon-12,
was accepted as standard,
since this would entail less
change in the value of
atomic weights generally.

Deoxyribose

Levene had identified the
sugar in some molecules of
nucleic acid as ribose (see
1909). There were other nu-
cleic acids from which a
sugar that was not ribose
could be obtained, but it
was not till 1929 that
Levene could identify that
other sugar. It turned out
to be deoxyribose, which
had a molecule just like
that of ribose except for a
missing oxygen atom.

That meant that there
were two types of nucleic
acid: ribosenucleic acid
and deoxyribonucleic acid,
usually abbreviated as
RNA and DNA, respec-
tively. It was DNA that was
found in chromosomes.

Heme

For ten years the German
chemist Hans Fischer
(1881—1945) had been puz-
zling out the structure of
heme, the complex molecu-
lar group that joined with
protein to form hemoglo-
bin. It was heme that sup-
plied blood’s color, that
contained the iron atom,
and that did the work of
picking up oxygen at the
lungs and giving it up at
the cells.

Heme was not com-
posed of amino acids, as
proteins were. It was a non-
protein adjunct of the mole-

cule, which consisted of a
porphyrin ring, four small
rings of atoms connected
into a larger ring. Attached
to this ring of rings were
eight side chains, four of
one kind, two of another,
and two of still another.

Once Fischer had the
general structure worked
out, he realized that the
side chains could be ar-
ranged in any of fifteen dif-
ferent ways. He organized
his students into groups
and had them each set
about synthesizing a differ-
ent arrangement. Fischer
then checked them all to
see which arrangement had
the properties of the natu-
ral substance.

By 1929 he had the
structure of heme worked
out to the last of its seven-
ty-five atoms, and for this
he was awarded the Nobel
Prize for chemistry in 1930.

Estrone

Males and females of the
same species develop differ-
ently. The sex organs arise
out of similar structures,
but though the penis and
the clitoris are homologous,
they are very different in
appearance and function.
The male grows a larger lar-
ynx, the female larger
breasts, the subcutaneous
fat distribution and the
hair pattern are different in
the two sexes, and so on.
