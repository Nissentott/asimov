oped the notion of dipole
moments (see 1912), tack-
led the problem. He sug-
gested that dissolved
electrolytes were indeed
completely dissociated in
solution but that each posi-
tive ion was attended by a
cloud of negative ions,
while each negative ion
was attended by a cloud of
positive ions, The two types
of ions therefore tended to
insulate each other to some
extent, and this gave the ap-
pearance of incomplete dis-
sociation. Debye, with an
assistant, the German
chemist Erich Huckel,
worked out equations to
represent the situation. The
Debye-Huckel equations are
the key to modern interpre-
tation of the properties of
solutions.

Acid-Base Pairs

After the notion of ionic dis-
sociation was established
by Arrhenius, an acid came
to be defined as a substance
that split up to yield hydro-
gen ions, while a base was
one that split up to yield hy-
droxyl ions (OH;s-). These
neutralized each other, be-
cause hydrogen ions and hy-
droxyl ions combined to
form neutral water mole-
cules.

The Danish chemist Jo-
hannes Nicolaus Bronsted
(1879-1947) suggested a

 

more general definition in
1923. An acid didn’t simply
give up a hydrogen ion
(which could be viewed as
a proton), because as a pro-
ton, it could not exist loose
in solution. The proton,
once it broke free of the
acid molecule, must
promptly attach itself to an-
other molecule. Therefore,
chemists ought to speak of
acid-base pairs. Whenever a
proton transferred from
one molecule to another,
the one that gave up the
proton was an acid, the
one that accepted it was a
base. This broadened the
concept and made it more
useful.

Coenzyme
Structure

Harden had shown that the
yeast enzyme that fer-
mented sugar had a nonpro-
tein portion, which he
called a coenzyme (see
1904). The chemical struc-
ture of that coenzyme was
unknown, however.

It was not until 1923
that a German chemist,
Hans Karl August Simon
von Euler-Chelpin (1873—
1964), solved that problem
and worked out the struc-
ture of Harden's coenzyme.
The structure was related
to that of the nucleotides
that formed the building
blocks of nucleic acid mole-

cules, and it received the
name of diphosphopyridine
nucleotide.

The most interesting
thing about the molecule
was that a portion of it,
when broken off, proved to
be the well-known chemi-
cal compound nicotin-
amide, which could easily
be changed to nicotinic
acid. Both possessed a six-
atom ring made up of five
carbon atoms and a nitro-
gen atom. This type of ring
did not occur in living tis-
sue except in this coenzyme
and in other closely related
compounds.

For this work, Euler-
Chelpin was awarded a
share (with Harden) of the
Nobel Prize for chemistry
in 1929.

Cepheids in
Andromeda

Three years earlier, Curtis
had debated Shapley over
whether the Andromeda
nebula was a distant galaxy
(see 1920).

The still-new 100-inch
telescope offered a way of
settling the matter. The
American astronomer
Edwin Powell Hubble
(1889-1953) used it in 1923
to study the Andromeda
nebula and managed to
make out some ordinary
stars (not novas) in it.
Some of these stars were
