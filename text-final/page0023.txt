make them and how to
interpret them, you have
writing.

The Sumerians seem to
have been the first to work
out a writing system, using
a stylus that produced
wedge-shaped marks in soft
clay. This was later called
cuneiform, from Greek
words meaning "‘wedge-
shaped.” As time went on,
the symbols became more
styvlized and somewhat sim-
pler and lost their function
as pictorial representa-
tions. Nevertheless, each
symbol stood for a word,
more or less, so that anyone
who wanted to read and
write had to memorize hun-
dreds and even thousands
of different symbols.

This meant that the lit-
erates (those who could
read and write) were al-
ways a small minority of
the population, but that
was all that was needed
in those days to run the
society.

Egypt picked up the
notion of writing and
invented a totally different
set of signs, as complicated
in its way as the cuneiform.

3100 B.C.

The Egyptian writing is
called hieroglyphic (from
Greek words meaning
"priestly writing," because
the Greeks came into con-
tact with it mostly in Egyp-
tian temples), It was
brushed onto thin flexible
sheets of papyrus pith.

Writing makes an enor-
mous difference. It is a kind
of frozen speech. Thoughts
and records remain much
more permanent than the
spoken word and, if care-
fully copied now and then,
persist indefinitely and re-
main more precise than the
memory of the spoken word
usually is.

This means that each
generation can learn, more
precisely and quickly, the
accumulated experience
and wisdom of the previous
generation, and advances
quicken as a result.

Furthermore, the re-
cords kept in writing give
us a reasonably exact ver-
sion of events that took
place in the past, complete
with names, places, and de-
tails. In order to under-
stand what went on in a
society without writing, we

must try to interpret mat-
ters from the artilacts they
left behind—from their pot-
tery, their art, and even
their garbage.

A society that possesses
writing is therefore historic.
One that does not is prefis-
torie. In other words, his-
tory began with Sumeria
about 3500 B.c.

Ploughs

In the early days of agricul-
ture, seed used to be secat-
tered over the ground,
where it grew in anarchic
fashion. Eventually it was
discovered that if the grain
was planted in separated
rows, it was then easier to
water, to weed, and to har-
vest.

In its simplest form,
the plough was a forked
stick that was dragged
through the soil making a
furrow in which the seeds
were planted. This greatly
hastened the rate of sow-
ing. A plough was first used
in Sumeria about 3500 B.C.

 

Nations

As city-states enlarged their
boundaries and grew more
populous, their territories

were bound Lo run into
each other and their inter-
dependence to grow.

Just as il was necessary
to organize matters within

a city-state when irrigation
came into use, it became
necessary to organize mat-
ters still further throughout
all the city-states of a par-
