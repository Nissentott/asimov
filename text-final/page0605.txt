 

was possible to measure
the energies absorbed and
given off by particles in
the beam in an extremely
accurate manner. For this,
he was awarded the

Nobel Prize for physics

in 1944.

Vitamin E
Synthesis

Vitamin structure was rap-
idly being worked out in
full detail. Karrer, who had
synthesized vitamin A (see
1930) and riboflavin (see
1935), synthesized vitamin
E in 1938 and thus estab-
lished its structure.

Phase-Contrast
Microscope

In 1938 the Dutch physicist
Frits Zernike (1888—1966)
constructed a microscope
based on a phenomenon he
had been investigating for
years. When it is diffracted,
light slightly alters its
phase so that different ob-
jects in a cell appear to take
on color even though they
are colorless ordinarily.
Making use of such diffrac-
tion allows objects within
the cell to be made out
clearly and easily without
killing the cell by adding a
dye. For this phase-contrast
microscope, Zernike

was awarded the Nobel
Prize for physics in
1953

Iconoscope

The existence of the cath-
ode ray tube (see 1876) had
raised a new possibility. If
an electron beam could be
made to pass over every part
of a screen as the result of an
appropriately varying mag-
netic field, and if the screen
could be made to fluoresce
appropriately, the electron
beam could paint a picture,
s0 to speak. The result would
be what was eventually
called a television screen.

The first practical tele-
vision camera was con-
structed in 1938 by the
Russian-born American en-
gineer Vladimir Kosma
Zworykin (1889-1982). He
called it an iconoscope. The
rear of the iconoscope was
coated with a large number
of tiny cesium-silver drop-
lets. Each emitted electrons
as a light beam scanned it,
in proportion to the bright-
ness of the light. The elec-
trons in the television tube
were controlled by the elec-
trons in the iconoscope, so
that the screen showed the
same scene that entered the
iconoscope.

Eventually, with im-
provements, the iconoscope
made television a practical
reality.

Xerography

In 1938 the American physi-
cist and lawyer Chester
Floyd Carlson (1906-1968),
aware of the constant need
for copies of patent specifi-
cations, labored to devise
some new way of providing
them. The means he found
involved attracting carbon
black to paper by localized
electrostatic forces.

This technique he
called xerography (from
Greek words meaning "dry
writing,” since no ink was
used), and his first success-
tul attempt came on Octo-
ber 22, 1938.

It took years to secure
a patent and interest a cor-
poration in the process.
Eventually, though, the pro-
cess led to the modern tech-
nique of photocopying,
which has virtually elimi-
nated the mimeograph ma-
chine and greatly reduced
the need for carbon paper.

Ballpoint Pen

In 1938 two Hungarian
brothers, Ladislao Biro and
Georg Biro, designed a ball-
point pen: ink from an in-
ternal reservoir coated a
tiny ball at the end of the
pen, and the ball rolled, de-
positing ink on the paper.
When the design was
sufficiently improved and a
high-viscosity ink was de-
