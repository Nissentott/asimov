Interferometer

In 1881 a German-born
American physicist, Albert
Abraham Michelson (1852—
1931), devised an interfer-
ometer, with the financial
help of Bell, who had in-
vented the telephone five
years before (see 1876).
This device acted to
split a beam of light in two,
send the parts along differ-
ent paths, then bring them

 

back together—a way of
treating light that Maxwell
(see 1855) had suggested six
years before. Then, no one
had had an instrument ca-
pable of the job; now Mi-
chelson had one.

If the two portions of
the light traveled precisely
the same distance at the
same speed, they would
then come back together in
phase, and the light would
be unchanged, If their dis-

 

tance or speed were slightly
different, however, the two
beams would be slightly
out of phase when they re-
joined, and interference
fringes should be set up
such as those Young had de-
tected and used to prove
the wave nature of light
(see 1801)

At this time, it was
thought that light, being a
wave, had to be a wave of
something. Consequently, it
was supposed that all space
was filled with a luminifer-
ous ether. (The word lumi-
niferous is from Latin,
meaning ‘‘light-carrying,”
and erher harks back to Aris-
totle’s aether—see 350 B.C.,
Five Elements.) This lumi-
niferous ether was thought
to be in a state of absolute
rest, and the Earth was
thought to be moving at
some particular speed rela-
tive to it, called Earth's ab-
solute motion.

Michelson used his in-
terlerometer to measure
Farth's absolute motion by
sending two halves of a
light beam traveling at
right angles to each other.
Light sent in the direction
of Earth’s motion through

 

 

    

the ether and back again
ought to complete its trip
little sooner than light tray-
