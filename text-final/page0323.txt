Synthetic Urea

The vitalist view on the sep-
aration of chemicals into or-
ganic and inorganic was
that only living tissue could
create organic molecules.

In 1828, however,
Wohler (see 1825) found
otherwise, even though, at
the time, he was making no
attempt to form an organic
compound. He was simply
heating ammonium cya-
nate, which was accepted
as a definitely inorganic
substance, when he found
crystals forming that re-
sembled those of urea,
which was the chief mam-
malian waste product dis-
posed of in urine (including
human urine). He tested
the crystals and found they
were ureca.

Both ammonium cya-
nate and urea have mole-
cules composed of the same
atoms (two nitrogen, four
hydrogen, a carbon, and an
oxygen) but differently ar-
ranged. They are isomers
(see 1823). Yet ammonium
cyanate was considered in-
organic, was not found in

tissue, and could be formed
by the chemist in the labo-
ratory—where urea could
now be formed also.

On February 22, 1828,
Wéhler announced his dis-
covery to Berzelius (see
1803), and the latter eventu-
ally conceded the point.
Now other chemists began
trying to synthesize organic
compounds—and suc-
ceeded. Another vitalist
bastion had fallen.

Notochord

Beginning in 1828, Baer
(see 1827) published a two-
volume textbook on embry-
ology. In it he pointed out
that, in early stages of their
development, vertebrate
embryos were quite simi-
lar, even among creatures
that in the end were very
dissimilar.

Small structures in dif-
ferent embryos, scarcely
distinguishable from each
other at first, might de-
velop into a wing in one
case, an arm in another, a
paw in a third, a fin in a

fourth, and a flipper in a
fifth. Baer believed that re-
lationships among animals
could be deduced more
properly by comparing em-
bryos than by comparing
adult structures, so that he
is considered the founder of
comparative embryology.

In particular, Baer
pointed out that early verte-
brate embryos possessed a
notochord for a short period
of time. The notochord is a
stiff rod running the length
of the back. Some very
primitive fishlike creatures
possess such a structure
throughout life, but in ver-
tebrates, it is quickly re-
placed by a spinal cord.
Nevertheless, the tempo-
rary existence of the noto-
chord in vertebrate
embryos shows their rela-
tionship to the primitive
creatures.

 

Thorium

In 1828 Berzelius (see 1803)
discovered another element
and named it thorium after
the Norse god of thunder,
Thor.
