humid day feels hotter than
a dry day at the same tem-
perature; a windy day
colder than a calm day

at the same tempera-

ture.

What is needed is some
physical phenomenon that
changes regularly in a mea-
surable way with changes
in temperature, and the
first person to attempt to
find such a phenomenon
was Galileo (see 1581).

He warmed an empty
bulb with a long tube ex-
tending from it, then
placed the open end of the
long tube into a container
of water. As the warm air
within the bulb cooled, it
contracted, and water was
drawn up into the tube. As
temperature changed and

the air within the bulb
cooled or warmed, the
water level rose or fell ac-
cordingly, and from the po-
sition of the level, one
could judge the tempera-
ture.

This was a very crude
device, because for one
thing the water level was
also affected by the air pres-
sure upon the water reser-
voir. Nevertheless, it was
the first thermometer (from
Greek words meaning “to
measure heat”).

Archaeology

The cities of Pompeii and
Herculaneum, near the
base of Mt. Vesuvius in
southern Italy, had been
buried under lava and ash
when the volcano unexpect-

edly erupted on August 24,
9%

For fifteen centuries
they remained hidden,
until an Italian engineer,
Domenico Fontana (1543—
1607), began tunneling
under a hill in order to es-
tablish an aqueduct. The
ruins were discovered in
the process.

This brought the real-
ization that part of the past
was actually preserved for
investigation in the pres-
ent. Excavation for the de-
liberate purpose of
studying the past did not
start for another century,
but the subject matter of
the study was known to be
waiting, so this discovery
might be viewed as the be-
ginning of modern archaeol-
0gy.

 

East Indies

After the defeat of the Span-
ish Armada, the Nether-
landers were heartened and
fought more fiercely than
ever. This was especially
true among the northern
Protestant half of the coun-
try, which eventually came
to be known as the Dutch
Republic. The southern half
remained Catholic and
under Spanish dominion
and was called the Spanish
Netherlands.

The Dutch, growing
stronger at sea and becom-
ing wealthy through sea
trade despite the Spanish
soldiers who harassed
them, looked for expansion
overseas. They had no hesi-
tation in invading lands
that were supposedly re-
served for the Spanish and
Portuguese (both ruled by
Philip II). After all, they
were anti-Catholic, anti-
Spanish, and pro-money.

In 1596, therefore, the
Dutch set up a factory at Pa-

lembang in the island of Su-
matra, in what came to be
called the East Indies. That
was the start of a Dutch
overseas empire.

The ancient Greeks had

one of them was squaring

circle of a particular size,
to construct a square with
the same area. The rules
