continuously round the cir-
cuit.

This is the Seebeck ef-
fect and it was the first
demonstration of the
phenomenon of thermoelec-
tricity. Nothing much was
done with it, however, for
over a century.

Glaciers

Mountain glaciers were
well known to people who
lived in mountainous areas
such as Switzerland. It was

 

known that they stretched
down the declivities on the
mountainsides like rivers of
ice; that the end in the val-
ley melted in the summer
and refroze in the winter;
that in advancing and re-
treating at the valley end,
the glaciers scraped rocks,
since the pebbles frozen
into the bottom of the gla-
ciers gouged striations into
those rocks.

It was also noticed by
some geologists that there
were striations in rocks

that were nowhere near gla-
ciers. It made sense to sup-
pose that the striations
could have been caused by
glaciers, but how?

A Swiss geologist, Ig-
natz Venetz (1788—1859),
decided there was only one
explanation. Glaciers must,
at some time in the past,
have extended far beyond
their present limits. He
published material to this
effect in 1821, but it made
no great impression at the
time.

Heat Flow

In 1807 the French mathe-
matician Jean-Baptiste-Jo-
seph, Baron Fourier (1768—
1830) had been able to dem-
onstrate what is called Fou-
rier’s theorem. This states
that any periodic oscilla-
tion (that is, any variation
that sooner or later repeats
itself exactly, over and
over) can be broken up into
a series of simple regular
wave motions (expressed as
sines and cosines), the sum

of which will be the origi-
nal complex periodic varia-
tion.

Fourier used his theo-
rem to study the flow of
heat and in 1822 published
a book entitled Analytical
Theory of Heat, which
amply explained that
branch of physics.

In the book, he showed
that it was necessary to use
a consistent set of units and
that, in equations involving
quantities expressed as so
many units, those units had

to balance on both sides of
the equation just as the
numbers did. This began
the technique of dimen-
sional analysis. Fourier sug-
gested that the basic set of
units should be those of
mass, length, and time, and
that other units be built up
of those three.
