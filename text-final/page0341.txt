Goodyear (1800-1860) had
a stroke of luck. He was try-
ing to add sulfur to rubber
when some of the mixture
came accidentally into con-
tact with a hot stove. To
Goodyear's astonishment,
those portions that weren't
scorched too badly became
dry and flexible, and they
didn’t lose flexibility in the
cold or dryness in the heat.
He began to heat the rub-
ber-sulfur mixture to
higher temperatures than
anyone else had tried and
thus obtained vulcanized
rubber (after Vulcan, the
Roman god of fire).

It was only with this
discovery that rubber be-
came truly useful, far more
useful eventually than any-
one might have suspected
in Goodyear's day.

Fuel Cell

Ordinary electric batteries,
even the Daniell cell (see
1836), obtain their energy
by, in effect, burning met-
als. Electricity, as obtained
from batteries, would be
much cheaper if ordinary
fuels could be burned in-
stead, a fuel cell.

In 1839 the British
physicist William Robert
Grove (1811-1896) devised
an electric cell that made
use of hydrogen and oxy-
gen, producing electricity
as they combined into
water. Even today hydro-
gen is still rather expensive,

 

however. Using methane or
coal dust along with oxy-
gen would be close to ideal,
but in all the century and a
half since Grove's discov-
ery, scientists have not
been able to make the fuel
cell practical. It remains a
laboratory curiosity.

Antarctica

The American explorer
Charles Wilkes (1798—1877)
commanded an exploring
expedition in Antarctic wa-
ters between 1838 and
1840. He cruised along the
limits of the sea to the
south of the Indian Ocean.
Ice everywhere prevented
him from landing, but he
saw enough land at a dis-
tance to realize, by 1839,
that there was a continent
within the Antarctic Circle.
The information he brought
home demonstrated this
amply (and part of the In-
dian Ocean sector of the
continent is still called
Wilkes Land in his honor),
so that Wilkes may be con-
sidered the discoverer of
Antarctica.

Ross Ice Shelf

Ross, who had located the
North Magnetic Pole (see
1831), set out in 1839 to ex-
plore Antarctic waters. In
the course of this explora-
tion, he discovered a large
oceanic inlet that cuts into
Antarctica and is now

known as Ross Sea in his
honor. The southern por-
tion of this sea is covered
with a vast overhang of ice
from the continental areas
behind and is now known
as the Ross Ice Shelf. He
also located Mt. Erebus, the
southernmost active vol-
cano.

Bicycle

The first vehicle a modern
would recognize as a bicy-
cle was designed in 1839 by
a British blacksmith, Kirk-
patrick Macmillan. It had
two wheels, of which the
rear was slightly larger,
and a seat between. It had
pedals, which were so ar-
ranged as to turn the rear
wheel. It was heavy and
clumsy and underwent a
number of fundamental
changes before becoming
the instrument of today,
but it did work. For the first
time, progress had been
made in allowing humans
to make use of their own
muscles to travel at a speed
greater than they could
run.

Lanthanum

The rare earths discovered
by Gadolin (see 1794) were
far more complex in chemi-
cal nature than he could
have expected. The Swed-
ish chemist Carl Gustaf Mo-
sander (1797-1858) did
more to reveal that com-
