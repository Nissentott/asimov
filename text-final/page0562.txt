tested the solution for pro-
tein content and found
none. From this he deduced
that enzymes were not pro-
teins, but actually the test
was not conclusive. En-
zymes might be so active
that they need be present in
only trace amounts to do
their work—in amounts too
small for Willstatter’s tests
to be positive.

The solution might be
to prepare more concen-
trated preparations of en-
zymes and then test them
This was done by the Ameri-
can biochemist James Bat-
cheller Sumner (1887—
1955). In 1926 he was ex-
tracting an enzyme from
jackbeans, one that cata-
lyzed the breakdown of the
waste product urea to am-
monia and carbon dioxide.
The enzyme was therefore
called urease.

In performing his ex-
traction, Sumner found
that a number of tiny crys-

  

 

tals precipitated out of one
of his fractions. He isolated
the crystals, dissolved
them, and found that not
only did they show strong
urease activity, but he
could not separate the ac-
tivity from the erystals. He
concluded that the crystals
were the enzyme. If he was
correct, it would be the first
time anyone had prepared
an enzyme in crystalline
form and therefore in rela-
tively pure condition.
When he tested the
crystals, he found them to
be incontrovertibly protein.
For this, he was awarded a
share of the Nobel Prize for
chemistry in 1946.

Pemnicious
Anemia

One form of anemia is par-
ticularly deadly and is
therefore called permicious

anemia. This disease was in-
vestigated by an American
physician, George Richards
Minot (1885-1950). Recall-
ing that Whipple had found
liver to be helpful in treat-
ing ordinary anemia (see
1920) and believing that
pernicious anemia might
be a dietary deficiency dis-
ease caused by the lack of
some essential vitamin,
Minot wondered if this vita-
min might be found in
liver. He and his assistant,
William Parry Murphy
(b. 1892), put pernicious
anemia patients on a
liver diet and by 1926 had
demonstrated success.
It wasn't pleasant, eat-
ing quantities of liver for
indefinite periods, but
it delayed death.

As a result, Minot
and Murphy (along with
Whipple) were awarded
the Nobel Prize for
medicine and physiology
in 1934,
