the surrounding jacket, fis-
sionable uranium-233 will
be formed.

Such breeder reactors
will actually breed more
fissionable fuel in the jack-
ets than is consumed in the
core, and this means that
all the uranium and tho-
rium supply of the world
can serve as potential fis-
sion fuel, rather than the
rare uranium-235 alone.
The vision of endless cheap
energy reached its peak at
this time, with few to pre-
dict that concerns about re-
actor safety and radioactive
ash would destroy the
American nuclear energy
industry.

Nuclear fission was clearly
not the ultimate nuclear en-
ergy source. It was well
known that nuclear fusion,
as in the conversion of hy-
drogen to helium taking
place in the stars, would
yield up to seven times as
much energy, weight for
weight, as nuclear fission.
Moreover, the ultimate
fusion fuel, hydrogen, is
available in virtually un-
limited quantities on Earth
and is easily obtained, as
compared with the rarer
and far more difficult to ex-
tract uranium and thorium
needed as fission fuel. Still
further, fusion produces

 

less dangerous products
than fission does.

However, whereas nu-
clear fission can be initi-
ated at room temperature,
through the use of slow
neutrons, nuclear fusion
requires the high tempera-
tures and pressures found
at the center of stars.

Uncontrolled fusion
is comparatively simple.
Some way can be found to
include hydrogen and other
light elements with an ordi-
nary fission bomb in such a
way that the fission explo-
sion produces sufficient
temperature and pressure
to ignite the much more
powerful and destructive
fusion explosion. The result
would be a nuclear fusion
bomb, more popularly
known as a hydrogen bomb,
or an H-bomb. 1t can also
be called a thermonuclear
device, where thermo-
means “‘heat,” because
that's what is needed.

The fact that the Soviet
Union had developed its
own fission bomb made
some scientists, notably the
violently anti-Seviet physi-
cist Edward Teller (see
1939), feel that the United
States should immediately
develop a hydrogen bomb
in order to maintain its pre-
ponderance of power. Other
scientists, notably Robert
Oppenheimer (see 1937),
sickened at the thought of
the damage such bombs

could do and aware that
the Soviets would then sim-
ply match it, were oppased.
The political decision was
to go ahead with the H-
bomb, and Teller saw to it
that Oppenheimer’s opposi-
tion was used to put an end
to his career.

Meanwhile, an attempt
began to devise a way to
produce controlled hydro-
gen fusion as a source of
peaceful energy—a much
harder task. It would be
necessary to raise the tem-
perature of hydrogen to
tens or even hundreds of
millions of degrees, while
confining this ultrahot hy-
drogen long enough to
allow fusion to begin.

At this temperature,
however, hydrogen’s ten-
dency is to expand explo-
sively and be gone unless it
is tightly enclosed. No ma-
terial container would do,
for either the hot hydrogen
would melt the container
or the cold container would
cool off the hydrogen.

The hydrogen might be
confined by a magnetic
field, however. It would
then merely be necessary to
devise some way of shaping
a magnetic field that was
strong enough to do the
job.

In 1951 the American
physicist Lyman Spitzer,
Jr. (b. 1914) supervised the
construction of a figure-8
device called a stellarator
