formation of both the DNA
and protein components of
the new viruses. The pro-
tein shell remained outside
but presumably contained
an enzyme that helped dis-
solve the cell wall and
allow the entrance of the
DNA.

Also in 1952, Joshua
Lederberg (see 1946)
showed that a bacterio-
phage could transfer ge-
netic material from one
infected cell to a new cell
that it infected later. This
meant that viruses could be
used as tools for introduc-
ing genetic changes, or mu-
tations. Lederberg termed
this process transduction; it
represented a technique
with potential for genetic
engineering.

Nerve Growth
Factor

The Italian embryologist
Rita Levi-Montalcini (b.
1909) worked on chick em-
bryos during World War II
under difficult conditions,
since she was Jewish. After
the war she continued her
work and found that an im-
plantation of certain tu-
mors in chick embryos
hastened nerve growth. By
1952 she could show that
the nerve growth factor was
a soluble substance re-

leased by the tumor. For
this work she received
the Nobel Prize for phys-
iology and medicine in
1986.

Radioimmune
Assay

By 1952 the American bio-
physicist Rosalyn Sussman
Yalow (b. 1921) had worked
out an extremely delicate
method for locating anti-
bodies and other biologi-
cally active substances
present in the body in quan-
tities so minute that they
were detectable in no other
way.
This is done by making
use of a substance con-
taining a radioactive atom
that will combine with the
biologically active material
in question. The presence of
the radioactive atom can be
detected and the extent of
combination determined
with great delicacy. This
makes possible numerous
significant tests (radioin-
mune assay) for the pres-
ence of significant
antibodies, greatly aiding
medical diagnosis and
allowing doctors to follow
the course of events in med-
ical treatment.

For this work, Yalow
shared in the Nobel Prize
for physiology and medi-
cine in 1977.

REM Sleep

Dreams were the subject of
mystical theories in primi-
tive times, being viewed as
messages from some other
realm not available to the
waking senses. Freud (see
1900) initiated another
form of dream analysis, but
some think it has mystical
components as well.

It was not till 1952 that
straightforward observa-
tions were made concern-
ing dreams, which didn't
make use of the subjective
reports of the dreamer. In
that year the American psy-
chologist William Charles
Dement (b. 1928), studying
sleeping subjects, noticed
periods of rapid eye move-
ment (REM) that some-
times persisted for minutes.
During these periods of
REM sleep, breathing,
heartbeat, and blood pres-
sure rose to waking levels.
He noted that such REM
sleep took up about a
quarter of the sleeping
time.

Sleepers who are awak-
ened during these periods
generally report that they
were having a dream. Fur-
thermore, a sleeper who is
continually disturbed dur-
ing these periods begins to
suffer psychological dis-
tress. The periods of REM
sleep are then multiplied
during succeeding nights as
