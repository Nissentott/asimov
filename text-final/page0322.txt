it became possible to think
of steam-powered warships
thereafter.

Mammalian
Ova

De Graaf had discovered
the ovarian follicles (see
1779), which were thought
to be the mammalian equiv-
alent of eggs. In 1827, how-
ever, a Russian
embryologist, Karl Ernst
von Baer (1792-1876),
opened a follicle of a dog
and examined a small yel-
low structure within. It was
this much smaller struc-
ture, seen only through a
microscope, that was the
mammalian egg, or ovion
(plural ova). This made it
clear that mammalian de-
velopment (including
human development, of
course) was not fundamen-
tally different from that of
other animals.

Food
Classification

Prior to this time, food was
seen to differ in appear-

ance, in smell, and in taste,
but anything that satisfied

 

hunger was assumed to be
as good as anything else
that did the same.

However, as chemistry
developed, it became clear
that foods differed in chemi-
cal nature and therefore
might be different in their
effect on the human body.
The first to make a broad
classification of foodstuffs
on a chemical basis was
Prout (see 1815) who, in
1827, divided food into
three broad classes, which
today we call carbohy-
drates, fats, and proteins.
Naturally, this classifica-
tion was not exhaustive,
and there are important
substances that do not fall
into any of these groups—
some of them present in
only small quantities, but
vital nevertheless.

Prout’s classification,
however, was a good start
toward understanding
some of the complexities of
dietetics.

Brownian
Motion

In 1827 the British botanist
Robert Brown (1773—1858)
was studying a water sus-
pension of pollen grains

under a microscope and
noted that the individual
grains were moving about
irregularly. This had noth-
ing to do with water cur-
rents, for the water was
still, and besides, while
some grains moved in one
direction, others would
move in the opposite direc-
tion, and still others in all
directions between.

Brown was at first not
surprised. Pollen grains
had sparks of life in them,
of course, and the motion
might be an aspect of life.
However, just to check the
matter, he then studied a
suspension of dye particles,
each about the size of a pol-
len grain, and unquestion-
ably not alive. To his
surprise, the dye particles
moved precisely as the pol-
len grains did.

Brown reported the ob-
servation, and the phenom-
enon has been called
Brownian motion ever
since. It seemed a small
thing and had no explana-
tion at the time, but eighty
years later it offered scien-
tists the final proof of the
existence of atoms.
