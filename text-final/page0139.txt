In 1586, Simon Stevin
(see 1583) is supposed to
have dropped two rocks at
the same time, one consid-
erably heavier than the
other, and showed that
they struck the ground at
the same time. Later ac-
counts said it was Galileo
who demonstrated this by
dropping different weights
simultaneously from the
Leaning Tower of Pisa.
Both stories may or may
not be true.

What is certain,
though, is that in 1589 Gali-
leo started a series of metic-
ulous tests with falling
baodies. Such bodies fall too
rapidly to make it easy to
measure the rate of fall ac-
curately, especially since
no accurate way of measur-
ing short periods of time
had yet been worked out.

Galileo therefore al-
lowed balls to roll down in-
clined planes. The more
nearly level the plane, the
more slowly the balls
moved under the pull of
gravity and the more easily
their rate of fall could be
measured by primitive
methods such as water drip-
ping out of a small hole. In
this way Galileo found it
quite easy to show that as
long as the balls were
heavy enough to be rela-
tively uninfluenced by air
resistance, they rolled
down an inclined plane at
the same rate.

He was also able to
show that the balls rolled
down the inclined plane
with a constant accelera-
tion—that is, they gained
speed with time at a con-
stant rate, under the con-
stant pull of gravity.

This settled another im-
portant point. Aristotle had
held that in order to keep a
body moving, a force bad to
be continually applied.
This again seemed to fit ob-
servation. If an object were
sent sliding across a floor,
it would quickly slow to a
stop. To keep it moving,
you would have to keep
pushing.

For this reason, it was
felt that the planets in their
eternal movement about
the Earth had to be continu-
ally pushed by angels.

Galileo’s observations
showed that a constant
push was not necessary to
keep an object moving, if
friction was removed. If a
constant pull was exerted
by gravity, for instance, an
object moved with a con-
stantly increasing speed.
Consequently, no angels
were required to keep the
planets moving.

Galilea's experiments
on moving bodies were so
impressive that, even
though he was not the first
to conduct experiments—
Peter Peregrinus had done
so more than three centu-
ries before (see 1269)—he is

usually given eredit for hav-
ing founded experimental
science.

Cryptanalysis

Simple codes are almost as
old as writing itself. After
all, by substituting or rear-
ranging words or letters ac-
cording to some
prearranged scheme, some-
thing that remains plain to
the people involved may be
made totally obscure 1o oth-
ers. In such cases, you have
a code or cryptogram.

Codes that can be
made can be broken, and as
the years went by, the use
of ever more subtle meth-
ods of encoding messages
were countered by ever
more subtle methods of de-
coding them.

An early example of
this came in 1589, when
France was in the last
stages of a civil war. Henry
I11(1551-1589) had no di-
rect heirs, and his second
cousin, Henry of Navarre
(1553-1610), was the logi-
cal successor. Henry of Na-
varre was a Huguenot,
however, and was bitterly
opposed, not only by
French Catholics but by
Philip II of Spain.

Philip 11 was using a
code that the French mathe-
matician Francois Viete
(1540-1603; in Latin Fran-
ciscus Vieta), working for
Henry of Navarre, was able
