gains on the ground, there-
fore, and curves off east-
ward. Similarly, if air or
water moves toward the
Equator, it finds the ground
moving faster and gaining
on it, so in effect, it curves
westward.

This curving motion is
the Coriolis effect, and it ac-
counts for the fact that air
currents and water cur-
rents take up circular paths
in opposite directions north
and south of the Equator.

Earth is so large that
under ordinary circum-
stances, we don't move
north or south fast enough
for the Coriolis effect to

 

 

 

come into significant play.
It must be taken into ac-
count, however, in the case
of artillery fire and satellite
launchings.

Revolvers

The various handguns that
had been used for nearly
four centuries could only be
fired once before time had
to be taken to reload.
Clearly this was a vulnera-
ble time for the user, and
the ability to fire more than
once before reloading
would provide an advan-
tage against opponents not
so equipped.

The first successful
handgun of this sort held
six bullets in a cylinder
that automatically rotated
with each shot, bringing an-
other bullet into line for
shooting. Known as a re-
volver, or a six-shooter, it
was patented in 1835 by
the American inventor
Samuel Colt (1814-1862).
The revolver became stan-
dard equipment in Amer-
icaâ€™s pioneer society. No
tales of the wild West, ei-
ther in print or on film,
could exist without copious
use of the revolver.

Pepsin

The discovery by Prout of
hydrochloric acid in the
stomach juices (see 1823)
led to the natural assump-
tion that it was the acid

that acted to break down
and digest foodstuffs in the
stomach.

That this was not the
case was shown by a Ger-
man physiologist, Theodor
Ambrose Hubert Schwann

(1810-1882). He had found
in 1834 that when an ex-
tract of the stomach lining
was mixed with acid, it had
a far greater power to dis-
solve meat than when acid
alone was used. By 1836 he
