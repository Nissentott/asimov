Very Long
Baseline Array

In late August, the world’s
largest astronomical instru-
ment began operating.
Spread over 5,000 miles of
U.S. territory, the Very Long
Baseline Array (VLBA) uses
an 82-foot dish at each of
ten sites—from Hawaii to
the Virgin Islands—to re-
ceive radio waves from
deep space. Together, the
ten dishes act as a single
radio telescope, synchro-
nized by the National
Radio Astronomy Observa-
tory in Socorro, New Mex-
ico. The VLBA produces
images with a resolution
500 times that of a per-
fectly functioning Hubble
Space Telescope (see 1990)

 

 

The VLBA is one of sev-
eral radio telescopes in a
growing arsenal of instru-
ments supporting very long
baseline interferometry.
With this technique, inter-
ference caused by the merg-
ing of data from two widely
spaced telescopes is ana-
lyzed for information and
electronically manipulated
to produce an image.

Far-distant objects are
moving away from Earth
within a Universe that is ex-
panding, so the light they
emit shifts out of the visible
portion of the electromag-
netic spectrum. Using the
radio-wave portion of the
spectrum, the VLBA can re-
ceive emissions from such
objects. Among the tele-
scope’s early achievements
was an examination of a

 

galaxy some 300 million
light-years from Earth.

The VLBA can also de-
liver information about
sites on Earth—for exam-
ple, that the North Ameri-
can continent is moving
away from Europe at the
rate of 0.8 inches per year,
and that the Hawaiian is-
lands are moving westward
at four inches a year. Thus
VLBA data may be helpful
in predicting seismic
events.

Fermat’s Last ‘
Theorem

In 1637 Pierre de Fermat
claimed he had a proof for
the mathematical proposi-
tion that the equation x* +
y " = znis impossible when
