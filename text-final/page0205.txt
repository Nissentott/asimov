o
Rifle

If the muzzle of a gun is ri-
fled—that is, outfitted with
spiral grooves—the bullet
is set to spinning, and a
spinning bullet can be
aimed with greater preci-
sion. Rifling was tried from
the early days of gunnery,
but rifling requires a
greater force to push the
bullet through the muzzle,
which means that guns

have to be better con-
structed and are harder to
reload. On the whole, the
smooth-bore muzzles of
muskets seemed better.
About 1710 or soon
thereafter, however, the
Pennsylvania rifle was de-
signed by the Pennsylvania
Dutch (not Dutch, really,
but German immigrants).
The Pennsylvania rifle
took twice as long to reload
as the musket, but it had

two to three times the
range and much greater ac-
curacy. As long as soldiers
fought with muskets, they
had to maintain a straight
line, and all had to shoot at
once in the general direc-
tion of the enemy, hoping
that by sheer luck some bul-
lets would strike home. If
they fought soldiers with ri-
fles, the rifles could pick
them off before they could
even get in musket range.

Newcomen
Steam Engine

The use of coke for iron
smelting (see 1709) in-

creased the demand for
coal out of which to make
coke, and that meant there

was a greater need for some

device to pump water out
of the coal mines. Savery’s

Miner’s Friend was too inef-
ficient and too dangerous.
In 1712 an English en-
gineer, Thomas Newcomen
(1663—-1729), devised a new
kind of steam engine. It
