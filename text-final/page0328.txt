Matches

For thousands of years,
fires had been started by
means of friction—f{riction
that entailed considerable
effort.

Then, beginning with
the discovery of phospho-
rus (see 1669), chemists
began to discover chemi-
cals so active that with
very little encouragement
they could burst into flame.
Why not, then, simply coat
the edge of a splint of wood
with some appropriate
chemical that could at the
proper time burst into
flame and set the wood on
fire? You would then have a
small fire that would last
long enough to ignite a
larger and longer-lasting
one. You would then have a
match (from an old word
for the nozzle of a lamp).

Such chemical matches
began to be produced in the
early 1800s, but the first to
be made were too hard to
ignite, or too messy, or t0o
dangerously easy to light.

In 1831, however, a
French chemist, Charles
Sauria, produced the first
practical friction match. It
contained phosphorus,
which was diluted with
other materials so that the
matches would not start to
flame until they were
struck on a rough surface.
The moderate amount of
heat induced by the friction
would then suffice to ignite

it. Such matches produced
flame quickly and quietly
when struck, and didn'’t de-
teriorate on standing. Their
use quickly spread.

There was one catch.
The phosphorus used in the
matches was quite poison-
ous, and people who
worked at producing the
matches would get the
phosphorus into their bod-
ies where it caused bone de-
generation and killed them
slowly and painfully. It
took some seventy years be-
fore this was corrected.

North Magnetic
Pole

Since the time of Gilbert
(see 1600), it had been un-
derstood that the Earth
must have a North Mag-
netic Pole and a South Mag-
netic Pole. The general (and
rather natural) feeling was
that the magnetic poles
would be near, or perhaps
exactly at, the rotational
poles. However, the Arctic
and Antarctic regions of
Earth, cold and desolate as
they were, could only be ex-
plored with great difficulty.
It was not until June 1,
1831, that the North Mag-
netic Pole was actually
reached. The feat was ac-
complished by a Scottish
explorer, James Clark Ross
(1800-1862). He found his
compass pointing straight
down, on the western shore

of Boothia Peninsula, at
70.85 degrees North Lati-
tude and 96.77 degrees
West Longitude. The pole
was discovered only be-
cause it was 2,100 miles
from the geographic North
Pole and therefore rela-
tively accessible. In fact, it
was only a few hundred
miles north of the Arctic
Circle.

Cell Nucleus

Brown, who had discovered
Brownian motion (see
1827) now noted a small
body within the cells that
composed plant tissues.
Others had observed this
before Brown but had paid
it little attention. Brown
was the first to recognize
that it was a regular feature
of cells, and he gave it the
name of nucleus (from
Latin words meaning “lit-
tle nut”—within the husk
of the cell, so to speak).
Today it is often re-
terred to as the cell nucleus
in order to distinguish it
from the atomic nucleus dis-
covered eighty years later.

Diffusion

We all know that gases dif-
fuse. If a bottle of perfume
is spilled in one corner of a
room, it is not long before
we can smell it in the oppo-
site corner.
