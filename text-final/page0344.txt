Negative

In the early years of photog-

raphy, the photograph that
was produced looked like
the object photographed (a
photographic positive) and
was the only one of its type.
One could not make copies
of it.

In 1841, however, an
English inventor, William
Henry Fox Talbot (1800—
1877), patented a device in
which a photographic nega-
tive could be formed on
glass, with all the naturally
light areas dark and vice
versa. Light could then be
passed through the nega-
tive onto sensitized paper
and a negative of the nega-
tive could be made, with all
the light areas light again
and all the dark areas dark.

The advantage of this
two-stage process was that,
given a negative, any num-
ber of positive prints could
be made. In 1844, in fact,
the first book was pub-
lished that was illustrated
with photographs.

Needle Gun

Until now, all military
small arms, whether arque-
buses, muskets, or rifles,

had been muzzle-loaded;
that is, in reloading, the
new bullet had to be forced
down the length of the muz-
zle. Since 1836, however, a
German inventor, Johann
Nikolaus von Dreyse (1787—
1867), had been working on
a breech-loading rifle, in
which bullets could be
slipped in at the rear of the
muzzle, making reloading
much more rapid. It was
perfected by 1841 and
called the needle gun be-
cause it had a needlelike
firing pin to detonate the
powder and send the bullet
flying. It was adopted by
the Prussian army, which
could then fire at a much
greater rate than an oppos-
ing army equipped with
only muzzle-loaders. This
did more than politicians
and generals to insure
Prussian domination of
Europe in the decades to
come.

Screw Threads

Industrial production could
be increased if parts were
standardized. The British
inventor Joseph Whitworth
(1803—1887), for instance,
had worked out techniques
for producing devices that
matched each other not
merely to the nearest six-

teenth of an inch but to the
nearest thousandth.

Even such improved
methods wouldn’t help if
different manufacturers
produced items of different
overall dimensions, how-
ever. For instance, one fac-
tory might produce screws,
all alike, and so might an-
other, but the pitch of the
screws in the two [actories
might be slightly different,
so that one screw might fit
a particular bolt and the
other might not. In 1841
Whitworth suggested a
standard pitch for all
screws made everywhere,
and the suggestion was
eventually adopted.

When trade becomes
first national, then interna-
tional, and finally world-
wide, such standardization
becomes first advisable,
then intensely useful, and
finally indispensable.
