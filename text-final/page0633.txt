heat wave, Schaefer
dropped some solid carbon
dioxide into the box to cool
it more eflectively.
Promptly, ice crystals
formed and a miniature
snowstorm whirled inside
the box. Solid carbon diox-
ide might therefore help in
cloud-seeding.

On November 13, 1946,
Schaefer was flown by air-

plane over a cloud layer in

western Massachusetts and
dumped 6 pounds of pellets
of frozen carbon dioxide. A

snowstorm started.

In mild weather, such
an artificial snowstorm
started at high altitudes
would, of course, turn to
rain as it fell. Nevertheless,
rain-making never became
important. In the first

place, it worked only if the
proper kinds of clouds were
presentâ€”in other words, if
it was likely to rain in any
case. In the second place,
rain that might be helpful
to some people would in-
variably be harmful to oth-
ers, so that to make rain
artificially would be to ask
for an infinite amount of lit-
igation.
