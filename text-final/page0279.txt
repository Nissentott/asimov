Rosetta Stone

While Bonaparteâ€™s army
was in Egypt, a French sol-
dier came across a black
stone near a town that Eu-
ropeans called Rosetta.
What he found was there-
fore called the Rosetta
Stone.

On the Rosetta Stone
was an inscription in Greek
dating back to 197 B.c. It

wasn't an interesting in-
scription in itself, but pres-
ent also were inscriptions
in two different forms of
Egyptian writing. If, as
seemed likely, this was the
same inscription in three
different languages, then
one had an inscription in

two forms of Egyptian writ-

ing, which at that time no
one could read, and a
Greek inscription that

many scholars could
read.

In the next few de-
cades, the Rosetta Stone
was studied in order to
learn the Egyptian lan-
guages, so that from in-
scriptions and writings left
behind by the Egyptians,
vast stretches of Egyptian
history might come to be
understood.

Electric Battery

Galvani, noting that dead
muscle twitched when
touched simultaneously by
two different metals, had
decided that electricity was
involved and that it origi-
nated in the muscle (see
1780). The Italian physicist

 

Alessandro Giuseppe Volta
(1745-1827) thought the
electricity originated in the
metals.

He began to experi-
ment with different metals
in contact and was soon
convinced that he was cor-
rect. In 1800 Volta con-
structed devices that would

produce electricity continu-
ously if it was drawn off as
produced. This created an
electric eurrent, which
turned out to be far more
useful than the nonflowing
electric charge of static
electricity

At first Volta used
bowls of salt solution to
