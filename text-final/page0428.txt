Flemming named the pro-
cess jmitosis, from a Greek
word for "thread.”

As cell division pro-
ceeded, the chromosomes
doubled in number. Then
came what seemed the cru-
cial step: the chromosomes,
entangled in the fine
threads of a structure that
Flemming named the aster
(Greek for "star’”’), were
pulled apart, half going to
one end of the cell and half
to the other. The cell then
divided, and the two off-
spring were each left with
an equal supply of chroma-
tin. Because the chromo-
somes had doubled before
the division, each offspring
had as much chromatin as
the original undivided cell.

Flemming summarized
his observations in Cell Sub-
stance, Nucleus, and Cell Di-
vision, which was
published in 1882.

All this was of the high-
est significance, but scien-
tists failed to draw the
proper conclusions, be-
cause they didn’t know of
Mendel's genetic work (see
1865).

Speed of Light

Since Foucault’s determina-
tion of the speed of light
(see 1849), no one had
succeeded in bettering the
figure.

However, Michelson
(the inventor of the inter-

ferometer—see 1881),
measured the speed of light
in 1882 and reported it to
be 186,320 miles per sec-
ond. This was over a thou-
sand miles per second
faster than Foucault had re-
ported, and Michelson's
value was the more accu-
rate. In fact, it was less
than 40 miles per second
above the value that is cur-
rently accepted.

Diffraction
Gratings

Fraunhofer had been the
first to use diffraction grat-
ings for the formation of
light spectra (see 1820). Dif-
fraction gratings would
form far better spectra,
which much sharper lines,
than prisms would, if the
parallel scratches on glass
or metal were fine enough
and numerous enough.

The American physicist
Henry Augustus Rowland
(1848—1901) had devised a
method for preparing grat-
ings of unexampled fine-
ness, and in 1882, he
prepared a grating in
which there were almost
15,000 lines per inch. Even-
tually, using gratings such
as these, Rowland could
prepare a map of the solar
spectrum in which the pre-
cise wavelengths of some
14,000 spectral lines were
given.

Tuberculosis

Tuberculosis was a very
common disease in the
nineteenth century. It did
not disfigure as smallpox
did, and it did not kill
quickly, but it progressed
inexorably and took a
heavy toll, of young people
particularly.

In 1882 Koch (see 1876)
isolated the tubercle bacil-
lus, the bacterium that
caused tuberculosis. This
led him to search for a
cure, and for a while he
thought he had one, but
was disappointed. Still,
such was the dread of the
disease that merely identi-
fying the germ seemed a
feat important enough to
warrant granting Koch a
Nobel Prize in medicine
and physiology in 1905.

Pi as
Transcendental

In 1882 the German mathe-
matician Ferdinand von
Lindemann (1852-1939)
studied pi, the ratio of the
circumference of a circle to
its diameter. Its value is
3.14159 . .. and so on, for-
ever, in a nonrepeating dec-
imal, for pi is an irrational
number.

Lindemann was able to
show that it was more than
irrational. It was transcen-
dental, as Hermite had
