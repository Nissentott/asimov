Since @rsted had shown
that an electric current
could produce a magnetic
effect (see 1820), it had
seemed to Faraday (see
1821) that there ought to be
some way of showing that
the reverse was also true,
that a magnet could induce
an electric current.

To do this, Faraday
made use of an iron ring. In
1831, he wound a coil of

wire around one portion of
the iron ring and attached
it to a battery. The circuit
could be opened or closed
by a key. If he closed the cir-
cuit, current would flow,
and a magnetic field would
be set up and concentrated
in the iron ring.

Suppose, then, that a
second coil was wrapped
around another segment of
the iron ring and connected
to a galvanometer. The
magnetic field set up in the
iron ring might produce a
current in this second coil,

and the galvanometer i
would record its presence.
The experiment
worked. Faraday had de-
vised the first electrical
transformer and had discov-
ered electromagnetic induc-
tion. However, it did not
work as he had expected.
There was no continuous
electric current to match
the continuous presence of
the magnetic field. Instead,
there was a momentary
flash of current, marked by
a jerk of the galvanometerâ€™s
needle when he closed the
