DNA as Genetic
Material

By now it had been under-
stood for some forty years
that chromosomes carried
the genetic material. It was
also known that chromo-
somes were nucleoprotein
in character, containing
both protein molecules and

supplied the diver with air
under pressure. It was self-
contained and light, so that
with an Aqualung and
finned devices on their feet,
divers could probe under
the water’s surface with
freedom and mobility. This

It was assumed that
the key portion of the ge-
netic material in chromo-
somes was the protein,
since at every point pro-
teins seemed to be the key
to living tissue. They were
giant molecules of enor-
mous variety and versatil-
ity; the enzymes, which
