mains of very ancient
wood. When coal was
found, it was burned. When
quantities were found
partly buried, the ground
was sometimes dug into to
find additional quantities.
There are records of coal
having been burned in
China about 1000 B.C., in
ancient Greece, among pre-

1241

Columbian Native Ameri-
cans, and so on.

For a long time, thes
were merely opportunistic
operations, but surface coal
was getting hard to find,
and people started digging
in earnestâ€”first in China.

In England, coal-min-
ing became a serious opera-
tion in the early thirteenth

 

century, and by 1228 Lon-
don was receiving ship-
ments of coal by sea from
Newecastle. (Londoners
called it sea-coal, for that
reason.)

Coal continued to be
burned as a substitute for
wood, all the more so as En-
gland was gradually being
deforested.

 

Rudders

To steer ships, it was cus-
tomary for someone to hold
a broad oar out back of the
ship and by turning it this
way and that cause the ship
to curve in its path as de-
sired. Eventually it oc-

curred to someone to make
the steering mechanism
part of the ship itself and to
control it from within the
ship. This is a rudder, from
an old word related to the
verb to row.

The Arabs had it first,
and it may have been an-

other item brought back by
the Crusaders. Ships of the
Hanseatic League (a trad-
ing combine of north Euro-
pean seaports that was
increasingly important at
this time) were using it
about 1241.
