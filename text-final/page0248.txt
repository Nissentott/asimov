1776

 

Races

Europeans were always
aware that groups of people
differed generally in ap-
pearances. The dark Medi-
terranean people were
aware that the Germanic
peoples were generally
taller and blonder. Europe-
ans noted the short height
and oddly shaped eyelids of
Asian invaders such as
Huns and Mongols, and
from ancient times they
knew of the dark-hued Afri-
cans.

The first orderly classi-
fication of these varieties
came in 1776, when a Ger-
man anthropologist, Jo-
hann Friedrich

Blumenbach (1752â€”1840),
divided the human species
into five races: Caucasian
(Europeans), Mongolian
(East Asians), Malayan
(Southeast Asians and Pa-
cific Islanders), Ethiopians
(sub-Saharan Africans), and
Americans (Native Ameri-
cans). A more unsophisti-
cated way of dividing them
is to call them, respec-
tively: the White, Yellow,
Brown, Black, and Red
races.

The fact remains,
though, that all human be-
ings, however superficially
different in appearance
they may be, are members
of a single species and can
freely interbreed. There is

no indication that there is
any important difference be-
tween any of these groups,
either physical, mental, or
psychological.
Blumenbach's divi-
sions were far too general
and simplistic, for each
group can be divided into
subgroups, and the Native
Australians are left out alto-
gether. Blumenbach's focus
on superficial differences of
skin color, hair form, and
eyelid shape merely served
to make it easier to express
racist views in scientific-
sounding language. The
dark evils of slavery and of
ethnic persecutions were
thus made to sound lofty
and biologically inevitable.
