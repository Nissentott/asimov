aware of what was going on
at all times and did not
have to be informed after-
ward of what had been
said.

In 1893 Freud and
Breuer published The Psy-
chic Mechanism of Hysteri-
cal Phenomena. This is
considered to have laid the
foundations of the medical
technique of psychoanaly-
sis.

Cattle Fever

In 1893 the American pa-
thologist Theobald Smith
(1859-1934) reported that
Texas cattle fever was
caused by a protozoan para-
site, as had been found to
be true of malaria thirteen
years before.

Smith went on to show
that the parasite was
spread from infected ani-
mals to healthy ones by
blood-sucking ticks. This
was the first definite indica-
tion that disease could be
spread by an arthropod.
Ticks were among the
arachnids (the spider fam-
ily), but it would soon be
shown that blood-sucking
insects could also be re-
sponsible for the spread of
disease.

 

Wavelengths
and
Temperature

At any temperature above
absolute zero, objects give
off electromagnetic radia-
tion. In general, very long
wavelengths are rare, as
are very short wavelengths.
Somewhere in between
there is a peak wavelength,
which is radiated to a
greater extent than any
other.

The German physicist
Wilhelm Wien (1864-1928)
demonstrated this by actu-
ally measuring the wave-
lengths. In 1893 he was
able to show that the peak
wavelength varies inversely
with absolute temperature.
As the temperature rises,
not only does the total
amount of radiation in-
crease, in line with Stefan's
finding (see 1879), but
the peak wavelength de-
creases.

Thus, warm bodies ra-
diate chiefly in the infrared,
of which we are unaware
except as a feeling of
warmth. As temperature
goes up, the peak slides to-
ward the visible red, and
eventually enough red is
produced to give the body a
deep red glow. It is then
“red-hot.” With further
temperature rise, the red
brightens, grows orange,
yellowish, and then white,

by which time the peak is
in the yellow and all the
wavelengths of light are
well represented, as in the
case of the Sun.

Some stars are so hot
that the peak wavelength is
in the ultraviolet. Such
stars gleam with an intense
blue-white light.

For his work on radia-
tion, Wien received the
Nobel Prize in physics in
1911.

Alternating
Current

Tesla had made alternating
current useful (see 1883).
By 1893 a German-born
American electrical engi-
neer, Charles Proteus
Steinmetz (1865-1923),
had worked out the intrica-
cies of alternating current
circuitry in complete math-
ematical detail, making use
of complex numbers.

This made it possible
to design alternating cur-
rent equipment with in-
creased efficiency.
Steinmetz’s mathematics
spread among the electrical
engineering profession and
completed the victory of al-
ternating current over di-
rect current. (The house
current we draw on when-
ever we plug an electrical
device into a wall socket is
invariably alternating cur-
rent.)
