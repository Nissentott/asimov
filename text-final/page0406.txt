In 1872 he published a
three-volume treatise on
bacteria that may be con-
sidered to have founded the
science. He made the first
systematic attempt to clas-
sify the bacteria into gen-
era and species. He was
also the first to describe
bacterial spores (the form
in which bacteria survive
periods of desiccation and
other unfavorable condi-
tions by retreating behind a
thick cell wall). Bacterial
spores are so tenacious of
life that they may even sur-
vive boiling.

Stellar
Photography

The advantage of taking a
photograph of something
you can see perfectly well
by eye is that the photo-

graph represents a perma-
nent record. This is
valuable in the case of spec-
tra of various light sources,
which can then be studied
with care and at leisure.

The American astrono-
mer Henry Draper (1837—
1882) was the first to photo-
graph a star’s spectrum
(that of Vega), in 1872, As
he adopted the use of dry
plates (see 1871), stellar
photography became eas-
ier, and eventually Draper
photographed the spectra
of over a hundred stars.

Experimental
Psychology

It might seem that psychol-
ogy is one science that we
would know as a matter of
course. We know how we
think, what our motiva-

tions and emotions are,
and, perhaps, feel that oth-
ers are like ourselves in
these respects. However,
being sure we know some-
thing is no substitute

for observation and
measurement.

It seemed to a German
psychologist, Wilhelm
Wundt (1832-1920), that
there were facets of human
behavior that could be
profitably measured. There
was, for instance, the man-
ner in which the human
brain handled sense impres-
sions. He thus initiated ex-
perimental psychology,
writing a textbook on the
subject in 1872. He went on
in later years to establish
the first laboratory devoted
to experimental psychology
and the first journal de-
voted to publishing find-
ings on the subject.

Gas Laws

Ever since Boyle (see 1662),
it had been known that

gases obeyed certain rules,
which interrelated volume,
pressure, and temperature.

In 1873, however, the
Dutch physicist Johannes
Diderik van der Waals
(1837—1923) showed that

gases would obey those sim-

ple laws exactly only if the
volume of the molecules

themselves were zero and if
there were no attraction be-
tween them. Actually, mole-
cules do have a small
volume and there is a small
attraction between them. If
the pressure on the gas is
