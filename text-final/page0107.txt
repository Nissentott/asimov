Concave Lenses

Until now, only convex
lenses had been used in eye-
glasses (see 1249). Convex
lenses are thicker in the cen-
ter than at the edges, and
they curve the light inward
so that on passing through
the lens of the eye it

reaches a focus sooner than

it otherwise would. This is

useful for eyves that are too

 

short and are ordinarily
far-sighted (usually among
the aged).

In 1451, however, the
German scholar Nicholas of
Cusa (1401-1464) sug
gested the use of concave
lenses, thinner in the center
than at the edges, to bend

light outward and bring it

  

to a locus later tt
otherwise take place. This

is useful for eves that are

 

too deep and that are othe

Johannes Gutenberg in
