Irrational
Numbers

The Greek philosepher Py-
thagoras (ca. 580—ca. 500
B.c.) believed that whole
numbers, including frac-
tions, since they are ratios
of whole numbers, were the
basis of the Universe. Thus,
¥4 is the ratio of 3 to 4. If
you begin with 3 pies and
divide them equally among
4 people, each person gets
*ls of a pie. Whole numbers
and fractions together
make up the rational num-
bers (those that can be ex-
pressed as ratios), and it is
easy Lo suppose that ratio-

nal numbers are all that
exist.

However, suppose you
have a right triangle with
each side equal to 1 unit.
What is the length of the hy-
potenuse? The answer can
be obtained by remember-
ing that the square of the
hypotenuse is equal to the
sum of the squares of the
sides. This was long known,
but Pythagoras worked out
a good proof and it is called
the Pythagorean theorem as
aresult.

The square of each side
is 1, so the square of the hy-
potenuse is 2, and the
length of the hypotenuse is
the square root of 2, or that

number which, when
multiplied by itself, equals
2. The number 7% is nearly
right, since 75 x s = 2.04.
The number /s is even
closer, since fso0 X "7/spo is
a little over 1.999.

[t can be shown quite
easily, just the same, that
there is no fraction, no frac-
tion at all, however compli-
cated, that when multiplied
by itself gives exactly 2.
The square root of 2 is
therefore not a rational
number. It is an irrational
nutimber, and as it turns out,
there are an infinite num-
ber of such irrationals.
