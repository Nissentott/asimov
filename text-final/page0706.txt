Electroweak
Interaction

There are four known parti-
cle interactions: strong,
weak, electromagnetic, and
gravitational. These seem
to account for all the events
taking place in the observ-
able universe, and they are
completely different from
one another. The electro-
magnetic and gravitational
interactions are both long-
range fields, with the elec-
tromagnetic enormously
the stronger of the two.
However, the electromag-
netic interaction exhibits
both attraction and repul-
sion, and these two proper-
ties tend to balance each
other. The gravitational in-
teraction, on the other
hand, exhibits attraction
only; it dominates the Uni-
verse as a whole, while the
electromagnetic interac-
tion dominates atomic and
molecular structure.

The strong and the
weak interactions are both
short-range fields, making
themselves felt only across
nuclear distances, with the
strong interaction much
the stronger (as the name
implies). The gravitational
interaction affects all parti-

cles with mass, while the
electromagnetic interac-
tion affects only electrically
charged particles, the strong
interaction affects only ha-
drons, and the weak inter-
action is most prominent in
connection with leptons.

The question arose
among physicists of why
there should be four differ-
ent interactions. Was there
not, perhaps, some way of
showing that all four were
but different aspects of one
basic interaction, just as
ice, water, and steam, de-
spite their differences in
properties, are nevertheless
all aspects of the same
“water substance’’?

Einstein had tried to
find a mathematical treat-
ment that could cover both
gravitational and electro-
magnetic interactions (at a
time when the strong and
weak interactions had not
yet been discovered) and
had failed.

In 1968, however, three
men, the American physi-
cists Steven Weinberg (b.
1933) and Sheldon Lee
Glashow (b. 1932) and the
Pakistani physicist Abdus
Salam (b. 1926), indepen-
dently worked out a mathe-
matical treatment that
included both the electro-

magnetic and weak interac-
tions. Careful observations
bore out the theory and
showed that the two are, in-
deed, a single interaction at
high enough temperatures,
It is only as the tempera-
ture drops that the two as-
pects separate (as dropping
temperature causes steam
to liquefy to water, and
then freeze to ice, with all
three capable of existing si-
multaneously at appro-
priate temperatures and
pressures).

As a result of this work-
ing out of what is called the
electroweak interaction,
Weinberg, Glashow, and
Salam shared the Nobel
Prize for physics in 1979.

Solar Neutrinos

Neutrinos had been de-
tected but only in the form
of antineutrinos produced
by nuclear fission reactors
(see 1956). The existence of
antineutrinos made the ex-
istence of neutrinos them-
selves certain; still it would
be useful to detect them di-
rectly.

The Sun produces its
energy by the fusion of hy-
drogen to helium (see
1929). In the process, vast
quantities of neutrinos are
