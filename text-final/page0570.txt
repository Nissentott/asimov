In 1929 the Russian-
born American physicist
George Gamow (1904—
1968) suggested that the nu-
clear source was the conver-
sion of hydrogen nuclei into
helium nuclei, since these
two elements made up
nearly all the Sun, as Rus-
sell had shown (see above).
As four hydrogen nuclei
had to fuse together to form
one helium nucleus, this
process was called nuclear
fusion, or more specifically,
hydrogen fusion.

However, not enough
was known about nuclear
fusion as yet for Gamow to
flesh out his suggestion in
detail.

Coincidence
Counter

In 1929 the German physi-
cist Walther Wilhelm
Georg Franz Bothe (1891—
1957) devised a new
method of studying cosmic
rays. He placed two Geiger
counters (see 1908) one
above the other and set up
a circuit that would record
an event only if both count-
ers recorded it virtually si-
multaneously.

This would happen
only if a cosmic ray parti-
cle, streaking down from
above, shot vertically
through both counters. Par-
ticles coming from some
other direction would pass

through one counter and
not the other. And particles
that were not cosmic rays,
though coming from the
right direction, would be in-
sufficiently energetic to
pass through both.

Such a coincidence
counter turned out to be
very useful in measuring
the shert intervals of time
between passage through
one counter and the next.
These ultrashort intervals
were still long enough for
events to take place on the
subatomic scale. Bothe
used this technique to show
that the laws of conserva-
tion of energy and of mo-
mentum were as valid for
atoms as for billiard balls.

For his coincidence
counters, Bothe was
awarded the Nobel Prize
for physics in 1954.

Particle
Accelerator

In the quarter-century
since the discovery of radio-
activity, the most energetic
particles easily available to
nuclear physicists had been
alpha particles. The shorter
the halFlife of a particular
radioactive isotope, the
more energetic the alpha
particles they produced.
Rutherford used alpha par-
ticles to bombard atoms
and induce nuclear reac-
tions (see 1906), but even

the most energetic alpha
particles could only do so
much. Of course, cosmic
ray particles were more
powerful still, much more
powerful, but they were not
under scientists’ control.

What was needed was
some way of beginning
with ordinary nuclear parti-
cles, say protons obtained
by ionizing hydrogen
atoms, and then accelerat-
ing them, perhaps by
means of an electromag-
netic field.

This was first accom-
plished by the British physi-
cist John Douglas Cockeroft
(1897-1967) and his co-
worker, the Irish physicist
Ernest Thomas Sinton Wal-
ton (b. 1903). In 1929 they
devised a voltage multiplier
that would build up high
electrical voltages capable
of accelerating protons to
the point where they con-
tained more energy than
the alpha particles oc-
curring in nature.

This was the first parti-
cle accelerator (better
known to the public for a
time as an atoni-smasher).
For this work, Cockeroft
and Walton were awarded
the Nobel Prize for physics
in 1951.
