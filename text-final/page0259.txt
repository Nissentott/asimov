rise nearly 2 miles in the
air.

In subsequent decades,
ballooning became almost
a craze, and it was also
used for scientific purposes.

Tungsten

A Spanish mineralogist,
Don Fausto D’Eluyar
(1755-1833), analyzed a

1784

mineral called wolframite,
which had been obtained
from a tin mine, and in
1783 he obtained a new
metal from it, which he
called wolfram. The same
metal is also called tung-
sten from the Swedish
words meaning “‘heavy
stone.” That word derives
from Scheele (see 1774),
who investigated tungsten-

containing minerals but
with his usual bad luck,
missed spotting the new
metal.

 

 

 

 

Volcanoes

In 1783 a volcanco in Ice-
land erupted and killed
one-fifth of the population
of the island. That winter
there was severe cold, and
in 1784 Benjamin Franklin
suggested that there might
be a connection between
the two events. Volcanic
ash shot high into the atmo-
sphere might reflect an ab-

normally high percentage
of the Sun'’s radiation, put-

ting the Earth in the shade,

so to speak, and cooling it.
This was the first specula-
tion on a phenomenon that

would be in the news begin-
ning in the 1980s as nuclear

winter.

Bifocal Lenses

Also in 1784, Franklin, who
in his old age needed two
sets of spectacles, one for
distant vision and one for
reading, grew tired of
changing them frequently.
He devised bifocc
cles, the lenses of which

 

 

were suited for distant vi
sion above and near vision
