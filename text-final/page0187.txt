Pressure
Cookers

Sixteen centuries after
Hero had created a device
that whirled because of
steam pressure (see 50), the
first useful application of
steam was advanced.

In 1679 the French
physicist Denis Papin
(1647-21712) developed the
pressuire cooker, a vessel
with a tightly fitted lid in
which water was boiled
and the accumulated steam
created a pressure that
raised water’s boiling
point. At this higher tem-

perature, bones softened
and meat cooked faster
than usual. A safety valve
was included in case the
steam pressure got too
high. Papin cooked a meal
for the Royal Society in his
device and prepared one for
Charles I as well.

 

1680

 

Muscles and
Bones

There has been a continu-
ing struggle between those
who feel that life is some-
thing fundamentally differ-
ent from nonlife and obeys
different laws of nature (vi-
talism), and those who be-
lieve that one set of natural
laws governs everything,

life and nonlife alike. Gener-
ally, over the last three cen-
turies, victory has come to
the latter group.

Thus, in 1680 the Ital-
ian physiologist Giovanni
Alfonso Borelli (1608—-1679)
posthumously published a
book, De Motu Animalium
(Concerning Animal Mo-
tion), in which he success-
fully explained muscular
action on a mechanical

basis, describing the ac-
tions of bones and muscles
in terms of a system of lev-
ers. The laws that applied
to inanimate levers also ap-
plied to our bone-muscle
systems. (Of course, the
bone-muscle action is one
of the simplest aspects of
life. Things got much more
difficult as scientists tried
to deal with the more com-
plex aspects of life.)
