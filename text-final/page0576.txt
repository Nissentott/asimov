and electron were too differ-
ent in too many ways, nota-
bly in mass.

In 1930 Dirac sug-
gested that both the elec-
tron and proton, as known,
were in the positive state,
but that each could exist in
a negative state as well.
That is, there should be a
particle precisely like the
negatively charged electron
in every way except that it
had a positive electric
charge, and there should be
a particle precisely like the
positively charged proton
in every way except that it
had a negative electric
charge.

These negative-state
particles came to be
thought of eventually as an-
tiparticles—an antielectron
and an antiproton— and it
was not difficult to imagine
that, just as protons and
electrons made up matter,
so antiprotons and antielec-
trons, if they actually ex-
isted, would make up
antimatter.

Dirac was correct, they
did exist, and he was
awarded a share (along
with Schrodinger—see
1926) of the Nobel Prize for
physics in 1933.

Cyclotron

The particle accelerator de-
veloped by Cockeroft and
Walton (see 1929) forced
particles to travel in a

straight line, faster and
faster, thus piling up more
and more energy, while
being pushed on ahead by a
magnetic field. The diffi-
culty with this was that in
order to get really high en-
ergies, the device had to be
inconveniently long.

It seemed to the Ameri-
can physicist Ernest Or-
lando Lawrence (1901 —
1958) that, instead of push-
ing the particles ever on-
ward, it might be handier
to make them travel in cir-
cles, giving them a magnet-
ic-field push each time they
came around.

In 1930, therefore, he
built a small device in
which protons were made
to travel between the poles
of a large magnet that de-
flected their paths into cir-

cles. At each turn, they
received another push of
electric potential. This
made them travel faster
and therefore in a path
that, under the constant
force of the magnet, curved
less sharply. The path was
a sort of spiral that brought
them closer and closer to
the rim of the instrument.
By the time the charged
particles finally shot out of
the instrument altogether,
they had accumulated high
energies indeed.

Lawrence called the de-
vice a cyclotron, because
the particles moved in cy-
cles. His first device was
quite small, but it pro-
duced more energetic parti-
cles than a very long
voltage multiplier would
have.
