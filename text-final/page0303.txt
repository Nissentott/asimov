sis was not taken seric
and as time went on,
atomic weights were

that the hypoesis seemed to
be disproved over and over.
Yet a century after it
was advanced, it turned out
that Prout’s hypothesis had
a large element of truth in
it, although as usual in
such cases, the truth was
more complex and subtle
than Prout could possibly

Paved Roads

Through most of histo
and in most places, roads
were simply bare earth

tended to be dusty in dr
weather, muddy in damp
weather, and worn into
ruts by vehicle wheels
that they were only mar
ally better than no roads
all. The Romans had built
good roads of stone (as had
other stable civilizations),
and Europe had depended
on them, where the;

h engine
businessman, John Loudon
McAdam (1756-1836), had
for years been investigatir
roads and experimenting
with road-building meth-

. He recommended that
roads be built higher than

the fields on either side, for

ind that they be
covered with large rocks
then with smaller rocks

pportunity to put
suggestions into practice
roads around Bristol, and
their obvious superiority to
what had existed before led
to the l‘ip]kl spread of mac-

wrably
ation and
communication acre
land.
