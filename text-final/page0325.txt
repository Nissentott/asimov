Achromatic
Microscopes

Chromatic aberration,
which had been the plague
of telescopists for the first
century of their existence
till the reflecting telescope
(see 1668) and the achro-
matic lens (see 1733) came
into use, was still plaguing
microscopists. The pres-
ence of colored fuzziness ef-
fectively hid the fine details
of what could be seen.

In 1830, however, an
achromatic microscope was
invented by a British opti-
cian, Joseph Jackson Lister
(1786—1869). Using it he
could see red blood corpus-
cles in detail for the first
time and found that they
were biconcave disks,
rather like candy Lifesavers
in which the holes had not
been punched through.

It was only with achro-
matic microscopes that bac-
teria could be usefully
studied.

Group Theory

In mathematics it is possi-
ble to do a great deal in a
short life. The French math-
ematician Evariste Galois
(1811—1832) was killed in a
duel before his twenty-first

birthday. Even so, he man-
aged to generalize the work
of Abel, who had shown the
impossibility of solving
equations of the fifth degree
by algebraic methods (see
1824).

Galois went on to show
that no equation of any de-
gree higher than the fourth
could be so solved. In order
to do this, he invented a
mathematical technique
called group theory, which
turned out to be useful a
century later in working
out quantum mechanics,
one of the two great physi-
cal theories developed in
the twentieth century that
successfully describe the
Universe.

o

Uniformitar-

.
ianism
Hutton's uniformitarianism
(see 1785) was now nearly
half a century old but had
not made much headway.
For one thing Hutton was
not an inspiring writer and
his chief opponent, Cuvier,
the supporter of catastro-
phism (see 1812), was.

In 1830, however, the
first volume of The Princi-
ples of Geology appeared.
Written by a British geolo-
gist, Charles Lyell (1797—

1875), it was to run to three
volumes. All were clearly
and attractively written
and explained the uniformi-
tarian theory so well that it
finally achieved popularity.
The extreme catastrophism
of Cuvier and his followers
thus went down to defeat.
This is not to say that the
pendulum doesn't swing
and that certain catastro-
phes in the course of
Earth'’s history did not take
place. Earth’s development
is now viewed as mainly,
but not entirely, uniformi-
tarian.
