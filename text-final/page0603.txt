 

dogs, and other animals
can manufacture all parts
of the coenzyme from sim-
pler substances—except
the nicotinamide. That has
to be present in the diet.
Since enzymes are needed
in trace quantities only, so
are coenzymes, and so, in
this case, is nicotinamide,
Animals can risk depending
on the diet for something
needed in so small a quan-
tity. Plants can make nico-
tinamide out of simpler
substances.

But suppose the diet
lacks even the trace quanti-
ties of nicotinamide that
are needed? In that case,
the enzyme won'’t work, car-
bohydrate metabolism will
proceed limpingly or not at
all, and serious symptoms
will arise.

Nicotinic acid is sim-
pler than nicotinamide and
is easily converted to nico-
tinamide in mammalian tis-
sue. Elvehjem therefore
added a very small quan-
tity of nicotinic acid to the
diet of a dog with black-
tongue, and it improved
markedly and very quickly.
It was at once apparent
that nicotinic acid and nico-
tinamide were the vitamins
that prevented pellagra, or
cured it if it occurred.

Because physicians
didn't want the lay public
to confuse nicotinic acid
with nicotine (a poisonous

alkaloid) and assume there
were vitamins in cigarettes,
they used the names niacin
and niacinamide for nico-
tinic acid and nicotin-
amide.

It turned out that other
vitamins also worked be-
cause they were essential
parts of coenzymes, parts
that could not be manufac-
tured in the body, were
needed only in trace
amounts, and could be
picked up ready-made from
the diet.

Yellow Fever
Vaccine

A vaccine that conferred im-
munity to one or another se-
rious disease was first used
by Jenner in connection
with smallpox (see 1796).
Pasteur had added other
vaccines against such dis-
eases as cholera, anthrax,
and rabies (see 1881).

The South African-born
American microbiologist
Max Theiler (1899-1972)
developed a vaccine against
yellow fever. By 1937, the
vaccine was quite safe and
effective, which did much
to remove the dread of this
terrible disease.

For this, Theiler was
awarded the Nobel Prize
for medicine and physiol-
ogy in 1951.

Evolution and
Mutation

Darwin had advanced the
theory of evolution by natu-
ral selection a century be-
fore (see 1858). He assumed
that selection took place be-
cause in every generation
there were small variations
amonyg the offspring of a
particular species. How
those variations arose, he
didn’t know.

Soon after Darwin,
Mendel had developed the
laws of genetics (see 1865),
and some decades later, De
Vries had shown the exis-
tence of mutations (see
1900). It seemed possible
that mutations provided
the variations that allowed
natural selection to func-
tion as a mechanism for
producing evolutionary
changes. The exact ratio-
nale of this was not quite
understood, however.

In 1937 the Russian-
born American geneticist
Theodosius Dobzhansky
(1900-1975), who worked
with fruit flies after the fash-
ion of Morgan (see 1927),
published a book entitled
Genetics and the Origin of
Species in which mutation
and evolution were neatly
joined together. As a result,
evolution was understood
on a molecular level as well
as on an organismic level.
