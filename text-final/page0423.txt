disturbances, including oc-

Breuer found that if
she could be induced to re-
late her fantasies, some-
times with the help of
hypnosis, her symptoms
were alleviated. He decided
that important causes of
such ailments were embed-
ded in the unconscious
mind, and that verbalizing
them consciously offered a
chance of a cure.

Electro-
mechanical
Calculator

The American census was
growing more and more
elaborate. There were more
and more people, and more
and more questions were
being asked of each person.
The information gathered
was so voluminous that it
took literally years to

sort it.

An American inventor,
Herman Hollerith (1860—
1929), who worked for the
census, thought there
might be a better way of
handling the data, and be-
ginning in 1880, he set
about the task.

He made use of punch
cards after the fashion of
Jacquard (see 1801) and
Babbage (see 1822). Each
card could be punched to
represent data gathered in

 

the census: holes in appro-
priate places could repre-
sent sex, age, occupation,
and so on.

In order to add up and
analyze all this informa-
tion, the cards were placed
on a stand and a metal de-
vice was pressed down
against them. The device
had many pins, which
would be stopped by the
cardboard. Wherever there
was a hole, however, a pin
would go through and
reach a pool of mercury un-
derneath. Electricity would
pass through that pin and
control the pointer on a
dial. As the punch cards
were sent rapidly through
the machine, it was only
necessary for people to re-
cord the numbers indicated
on the dial.

What made all the dif-
ference between Hollerith
and Babbage was that Hol-
lerith had the use of elec-
tricity. He had developed
an electromechanical calcu-
lator, and not merely a me-
chanical one.

Eventually, Hollerith
founded a company de-
voted to making all kinds of
machines that could handle
and analyze information.
That company developed
into the International Busi-
ness Machines Corporation,
usually known simply as
IBM.

Charged
Cathode Rays

There was some question
about the nature of the
cathode rays to which
Goldstein had given a name
(see 1876). Most of the re-
ported observations could
be explained equally well
by supposing cathode rays
to be either a form of elec-
tromagnetic radiation, like
light, or a stream of parti-
cles.

The matter was investi-
gated by Crookes (see
1861), who in 1875 had de-
vised a vacuum tube that
was even better than Geis-
sler’s (see 1855).

In 1880, using his own
Crookes tube, he showed
that cathode rays traveled
in straight lines and cast
sharp shadows. The radia-
tion could even turn a
small wheel, which it
struck on one side. This
still left the nature of the
rays uncertain.

But then Crookes
showed that a magnet
would cause cathode rays
to curve in their path, and
from the manner of curv-
ing, it seemed quite certain
that they carried a negative
electric charge. Since there
seemed no way electromag-
netic waves could carry
such a charge, Crookes con-
cluded that cathode rays
were actually a stream of
