 

Fritz Albert Lipmann
(1899-1986) showed that
there were two kinds of
phosphate bonds. In one
kind, the loss of the phos-
phate bond liberated a rela-
tively small quantity of
energy; in the other, the
loss liberated a relatively
large quantity. The latter
esters possessed a high-en-
ergy phosphate.

In the course of carbo-
hydrate metabolism, phos-
phate groups are added to
sugar molecules forming a
low-energy phosphate. The
sugar molecule then under-
goes the kind of change that
concentrates the energy in
the phosphate group, so
that a high-energy phos-
phate is formed. These
high-energy phosphate
groups then serve as the
“small change" of energy.
In the simplest terms,
food and oxygen combine
to form high-energy
phosphate bonds,
which then deal out
energy for all the energy-
consuming functions
of the body.

The most versatile of
the high-energy configura-
tions is a compound called
adenosine triphosphate
(ATP), each molecule of
which contains two high-
energy phosphates and
which has been found to
be concerned with body
chemistry at almost every
point where energy is
required.

Polarimetry

The Czechoslovakian physi-
cal chemist Jaroslav Heyro-
vsky (1890-1967) had
worked for years on a de-
vice that contained a mer-
cury electrode so arranged
that a small drop of mer-
cury repeatedly fell
through a solution to a mer-
cury pool beneath. An elec-
tric current flowed through
the solution and, as the po-
tential was increased, the
current reached a plateau,
the height of which de-
pended on the concentra-
tion of certain ions in the
solution. In this way one
could analyze a solution of
unknown composition.

By 1941 Heyrovsky had
perfected this technique,
which he called polarimetry,
and for this work, he
was awarded the Nobel
Prize for chemistry in
1959.

Cardiac
Catheterization

Forssmann had introduced
the principle of cardiac
catheterization (inserting a
catheter into a vein and ma-
neuvering it to the heart—
see 1929). In 1941 it was in-
troduced into clinical prac-
tice by the French-born
American physiologist
André Frédéric Cournand
(1895—1988) and the Ameri-
can physician Dickinson

Woodruff Richards (1895—
1973). As a result, Cour-
nand and Richards were
awarded the Nobel Prize
for physiology and medi-
cine in 1956, sharing it
with Forssmann.

Distance of the
Sun

The earliest reasonable esti-
mate of the distance to the
Sun had been based on Cas-
sini’s measurement of the
parallax of Mars (see 1672).
Measurement of the paral-
lax had improved with
time, but it was always dif-
ficult to deal with Mars in
this respect, since it
showed a small orb in the
telescope, which forced a
certain ambiguity on the
measurement of its exact
position.

Nearly a century be-
fore, the German astrono-
mer Johann Gottfried Galle
(1812—1910) had suggested
that the parallax of an as-
teroid be used for determin-
ing the scale of the Solar
System and the distance of
the Sun, since its size and
starlike appearance would
make its positioning more
accurate. However, aster-
oids were farther off than
Mars and their parallax
was correspondingly
smaller and harder 1o mea-
sure.
