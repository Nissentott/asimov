(message) out into the cyto-
plasm and were therefore
called messenger RNA.

Each transfer-RNA
molecule had a three-
nucleotide combination
at one end that fit three-
nucleotide combinations
at certain spots on the mes-
senger RNA. So when the
messenger RNA settled on
the ribosome surface,
various transfer-RNA
molecules lined up,
trinucleotide to appro-
priate trinucleotide, and
the amino acids on the
other end combined.

Thus information was
transferred from the DNA
in the chromosome to the
messenger RNA, which
traveled out from the nu-
cleus to the ribosomes in
the cytoplasm and gave the
information to the transfer-
RNA molecules, which
transferred the information
to the amino acids and
formed the protein

Three adjacent nu-
cleotides along the DNA
molecule plus the messen-

 

ger-RNA molecule plus the
transfer-RNA molecule

made a particular ami
acid (as Gamow—see 1929

 

 

—had first suggested might
be the case). What
cists had to do was 1o figure
out which trinucleotide
translated into which
amino acid. In other words,
they had to work out the
netic code.

Pituitary
Hormones

The structure of oxytocin
had been worked out by du
Vigneaud (see 1954) and
that of insulin by Sanger
(see 1952). The Chinese-
born American biochemist
Choh Hao Li (b. 1913) used
the methods they had pio-
neered, to tackle the protein
hormones manufactured by
the pituitary gland.

In 1956 he showed that
the molecule of ACTH (adre-
nocorticotrophic hornone
which stimulated the pro-
duction of steroid hor-

  

mones like cortisone by the
adrenal cortex) was made
up of 39 ami

specity

amino acid chain with the

ACTH chain

Also in 1956, Li iso-
lated human growth hox
mone from the pituitary
gland and worked out the
exact order of the 256
amino acids that made up
its chain. Its structure was
quite dilterent from the
analogous hormone in cat
tle or swine. Whereas some
hormones can be useful to
human beings even if ob
