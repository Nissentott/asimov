approximate size of atoms
could be deduced from an
actual observation. Atoms,
it turned out, are about a
hundred-millionth of a cen-
timeter in diameter. In
other words, 250,000,000 of
them, lined up side by side,
would stretch about an
inch.

This was the final dem-
onstration of the real exis-
tence of atoms. They were
not merely a convenient hy-
pothesis designed to make
chemical calculations eas-
ier.

Liquid Helium

It had been ten years since
Dewar liquefied hydrogen
(see 1898) and left helium
as the only unliquefied gas.

In 1908 the Dutch phys-
icist Heike Kamerlingh
Onnes (1853-1926) set
about the task of liquetying
helium. He built an elabo-
rate device that would cool
helium intensively by
means of evaporating lig-
uid hydrogen. When the he-
lium had reached a very
low temperature under
compressed conditions, it
would be allowed to ex-
pand so that it would cool
still further.

In this way, liquid he-
lium was finally collected
in a flask set within a larger
flask of liquid hydrogen,
which was in turn con-
tained in a still larger flask

of liquid airâ€”so that the
liquid helium would gain
heat and vaporize only very
slowly.

It turned out that he-
lium liquefied at a tempera-
ture of only 4 degrees above
absolute zero. By allowing
some of it to evaporate,
Kamerlingh Onnes reached
a temperature of only 0.8
degrees above absolute
zero, but even then he
could not solidify it.

For his liquefaction of
helium, Kamerlingh Onnes
was awarded the Nobel
Prize in physics in 1913.

Geiger Counter

Rutherford, who had re-
cently shown the relation-
ship of alpha particles to
helium (see 1906), was
deeply engaged in investi-
gations involving the ener-
getic particles emitted by
radioactive substances. His
labors were made easier by
the invention of a device to
detect and, eventually, re-
cord such particles.

The invention was that
of his assistant, Geiger (see
1906), who in 1908 pro-
duced the first rather primi-
tive version of his device.
Essentially, it was a cylin-
der containing a gas under
a high electric potential,
but one not quite high
enough to overcome the re-
sistance of the gas and set
up a spark of discharge.

If a high-energy sub-

atomic particle entered, it
would rip some of the elec-
trons off a gas molecule,
and what was left of the
molecule would be a posi-
tively charged ion, which
would be pulled toward the
negatively charged cathode
with great energy. In the
process, as a result of colli-
sions, the ion would pro-
duce further ions, each of
which would do the same.
In short, a single subatomic
particle, on entering, would
set off an avalanche of ion-
ization, producing a mo-
mentary electric discharge,
which could be arranged to
make a clicking sound. The
clicking of such a Geiger
counter gives us informa-
tion that our senses cannot
give us.

Sunspots and
Magnetism

For some three centuries,
astronomers had observed
sunspots, counted them, no-
ticed the manner in which
they increased and de-
creased cyclicly in number,
but knew nothing more
about them than they could
see. Hale, who had in-
vented the spectrohelio-
graph (see 1890) and
supervised the construction
of the 40-inch refractor (see
1897), changed that.

In 1908 he was able to
show from the spectrum of
sunspots that they exhib-
