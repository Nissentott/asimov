Resonance
Particles

The bubble chamber (see
1953) was excellent at de-
tecting ultra-short-lived
particles. The American
physicist Luis Walter Alv-
arez (1911-1988) con-
structed huge bubble
chambers and, beginning in
1960, detected particles
that existed for only a few
trillionths of a trillionth of
a second before breaking
down. The tracks they left
in this incredibly short life-
time, even if they moved at
the speed of light, were too
small to detect directly.
The existence of these so-
called resonance particles
could only be deduced
from the nature of their
longer-lived breakdown
products.

The resonance parti-
cles, all hadrons (see 1952,
Kaons and Hyperons),
came to be discovered in
great numbers until some-
thing like 150 had been
found. It seemed impossi-
ble for so many different
particles to exist sepa-
rately, so the search was on
for still simpler and far
fewer particles that, in dif-
ferent combinations, might
make up all these reso-
nance particles.

For this work, Alvarez
was awarded the Nobel
Prize for physics in 1968.

Sea-Floor
Spreading

Once it was understood
that the Earth's crust was
divided up into a few large
plates and some smaller
ones, it seemed unlikely
that the plates retained
their position forever. Al-
though Wegener's theory of
continental drift (see 1912)
seemed quite impossible,
since the continents could
not plow their way through
the underlying rock, the
similarity between the op-
posite coasts of the Atlantic
Ocean might be accounted
for in other ways.

In 1960 the American
geophysicist Harry Ham-
mond Hess (1906-1969) de-
cided it was quite possible
that molten magma from
the mantle might ooze up-
ward through the Great
Global Rift (see 1953). That
might force the North
American and South Ameri-
can plates farther west-
ward while the Eurasian
and African plates were
forced further eastward.

The Atlantic ocean
would thus widen, in what
came to be called sea-floor
spreading, but its coasts
would retain their shape
from the time the conti-
nents were in contact.

Continental drift, then,
was not the result of conti-
nents slowly floating on the

underlying rock, as Weg-
ener had thought. The con-
tinents were firmly fixed to
the plates and could not
move through them. But
the plates themselves were
forced apart in some places
and forced together in oth-
ers. Actual evidence for this
new view was not long in
coming.

Weather
Satellites

Satellites intended primar-
ily for the observation of
the Earth began to be
launched. The first was
Tiros I, launched by the
United States on April 1,
1960. In November Tiros 11
was launched, and in ten
weeks it sent down over
20,000 photographs of vast
stretches of Earth and its
cloud cover. It took photos
of a cyclone in New
Zealand and of a patch of
clouds in Oklahoma that
was apparently spawning
tornadoes.

These and other
weather satellites that fol-
lowed became indispens-
able in tracking hurricanes
and other violent storms
and in helping to predict
weather. Innumerable lives
must have been saved and
enormous property damage
avoided because of timely
warnings of the approach
of hurricanes (though they
