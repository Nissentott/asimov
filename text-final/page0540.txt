Deflection of

e
Light
Einstein had advanced the
theory of general relativity,
which among other things
predicted that light rays
would bend slightly and fol-
low a gently curved path
when in a gravitational
field (see 1916). The one
way of testing that would
be to study the stars in the
immediate neighborhood of
the Sun during a total
eclipse, but astronomers
had to wait for the end of
World War I to make an
eclipse expedition feasible.

On May 29, 1919, a
solar eclipse was scheduled
to take place at just the
time when more bright
stars would be in the vicin-
ity of the eclipsed Sun than
would be there at any other
time of the year.

The Royal Astronomi-
cal Society of London,
under the leadership of Ar-
thur Stanley Eddington
(1882—1944), who was a
great enthusiast of Ein-
stein’s theories, made ready
two expeditions, one to
northern Brazil and one to
Principe Island in the Gulf
of Guinea off the coast of
West Africa. The positions
of the bright stars near the
Sun were measured rela-
tive to each other at the
time of the eclipse. If light

was bent in its passage
near the Sun, those stars
would all seem to shift
away from the Sun and
would appear to be slightly
farther apart from each
other than they would six
months earlier or six
months later when they
rode high in the midnight
sky.

The positions of the
stars proved to be in line
with what Einstein had pre-
dicted, and this was consid-
ered a grand verification of
general relativity.

However, the measure-
ments were borderline and
a trifle uncertain, and none
of the tests of general rela-
tivity were entirely conclu-
sive for an additional forty
years, so that a number of
other types of cosmological
theories were advanced to
compete with that of Ein-
stein. (On the other hand,
special relativity was con-
firmed over and over, and
there has been no reason-
able doubt concerning it for
three-fourths of a century.)

Bee
Communication

Pavlov’s conditioned re-
sponses (see 1907) could be
used to elicit answers from
animals about what they
sensed.

The Austrian-born Ger-
man zoologist Karl von

Frisch (1886-1982), for in-
stance, conditioned bees to
go to certain locations to
pick up nectar, making cer-
tain that the location was
of a certain color. They
would then fly to other
places of the same color,
since they had been condi-
tioned to react to that color
as they would toa food
source.

Frisch then changed
the color to see what would
happen to the conditioning.
Thus, if he conditioned the
bees to black and then sub-
stituted red, they flew to it
anyway, indicating that
they could not see red—red
was black to them. How-
ever, if they were condi-
tioned to black and that
was changed to ultraviolet
(which would still look
black to human eyes), the
bees no longer flew to it.
They could see ultraviolet.

By 1919 Frisch had
also interpreted the man-
ner in which the bee com-
municated its findings to
its colleagues of the hive,
Having obtained honey
from a new source, the re-
turning bee would “dance,”
moving round and round or
side to side. The number of
the evolutions and their
speed gave the necessary in-
formation about the loca-
tion of the new source.
Frisch also showed that
bees could orient them-
selves in flight by the direc-
