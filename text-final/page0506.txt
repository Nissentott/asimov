Genes

Thanks to the work of Mor-
gan and his fruit flies (see
1907), it was established
that chromosomes con-
tained chains of many units
of inheritance. It would ob-
viously be convenient to
have some way of referring
to those units in a concise
way. In 1909 the Danish
botanist Wilhelm Ludvig
Johannsen (1857-1927) sug-
gested that they be called
genes. The suggestion was
adopted.

Tungsten Wire

When Edison introduced
the electric light bulb (see
1879), he used carbon fibers
as filaments. These were
brittle, hard to handle, and
didn't last long. Obviously
some sort of metal wire
would be better. However,
it would have to be of a
metal with a high melting
point so that it could with-
stand white-hot tempera-
tures, and such metals were
for the most part expensive,
hard to draw into wires, or
both.

The metal with the
highest melting point is
tungsten, which melts at
about 3410° C. It is not inor-

dinately expensive, but it is
brittle. In 1909, however,
the American physicist Wil-
liam David Coolidge (1873-
1975) managed to perfect a
method of drawing tung-
sten into fine wires.

As a result, tungsten
filaments became universal
in light bulbs, radio tubes,
and other devices. Light
bulbs lasted for consider-
ably longer before having
to be replaced, therefore,
though further improve-
ments remained to be
made.

Bakelite

Hyatt's celluloid had been
the first important syn-
thetic plastic (see 1869),
but in the forty years since
it had been introduced,
there had been no flood of
additional plastics on the
market.

The real beginning
came with the work of a
Belgian-born American
chemist, Leo Hendrik
Baekeland (1863-1944).

It often happened in or-
ganic chemistry that hard
tarry residues fouled chemi-
cal equipment and then
could not be removed.
Baekeland tried to find
some solvent that would re-
move them. For the pur-
pose, he deliberately
reacted phenol with formal-
dehyde to form such a resi-
due, and then searched for

a solvent. He couldn’t find
one.

It occurred to him that
if the residue was so resis-
tant to solvents, it might
have a useful application in
its own right as an inert,
strong, and cheap material,
so he began to concentrate
on forming the resinous
mass more efficiently and
making it still harder and
tougher. By using the
proper heat and pressure,
he obtained a liquid that so-
lidified and took the shape
of the container it was in.
Once solid, it was hard,
water-resistant, solvent-
resistant, and an electrical
insulator. Yet it could be
cut without trouble and
was easily machined.

In 1909 he brought this
substance (which he named
Babkelite, after himself) on
the market. Bakelite was
the first of the thermosetting
plastics (one that once set
will not soften under heat)
and has been useful ever
since, It sparked the mod-
ern development of plas-
tics.

There was an earthquake in
the Balkans in 1909, and a
Croatian geologist, Andrija
Mohorovic¢i¢ (1857—1936),

eled through the Earth’s
