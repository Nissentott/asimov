didn’t depend on using
steam to form a vacuum
that would suck water up-
ward and then using high-
pressure steam to blow it
out, Newcomen's engine
used ordinary low-pressure
steam to push a piston.
That meant the pistons
didn’t have to fit as tightly

as they must when high-
pressure steam is used, and
it meant the machine was
less dangerous.

Newcomen engines
proved quite popular, but
they were still terribly inef-
ficient. Most of the heat of
the burning fuel went into
heating the chamber till

water boiled into steam
and pushed the piston.
Then the chamber was
cooled to let the piston
move back, after which the
chamber had to be refilled
with water and heated all
over again for another for-
ward thrust.

Smallpox
Inoculation

Smallpox was the dread
disease of this time. The
plague, which had been the
enormous danger of the last
half of the 1300s (see 1346),
still struck, but only in iso-
lated places and briefly,
and was never again quite
the universal danger it had
been in the earlier period,
perhaps because human be-
ings had gained greater im-
munity. Smallpox,
however, was increasing,
and the great dread it in-

spired was not merely be-
cause it frequently killed,
but because even when it
did not, it disfigured. The
large puckered pockmarks
it would form left faces vi-
sions of ugliness.

If one survived small-
pox, h()\.\’L’\'f'r, one was Safe
from a second attack. A pa-
tient would only get it
once. What's more, some
smallpox cases were rather
mild, didn’t kill, and only
slightly disfigured, but the
mild cases led to immunity
against a second attack just
as efficiently as severe cases
did. It followed that a mild

case of smallpox was actu-
ally better than none at all.

The reasoning, then,
was that if you knew some-
one with a mild case of
smallpox, you might get
close to him or her in the
hope that you would catch
a case just as mild.

In 1713, in fact, the
English poet Lady Mary
Wortley Montagu (1689—
1762), whose husband was
a British ambassador to
Turkey and who accompa-
nied him there, brought
back the news that in Tur-
key they were actually inoc-
ulating people with pus
