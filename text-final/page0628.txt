cles had reached energies of
about 20,000,000 electron-
volts (20 MeV), however,
they had gained so much
mass, in line with special
relativity (see 1905), that
they were curving less
sharply and their circlings
within the instrument fell
out of phase with the peri-
odic alternations of the
magnetic field. They could
gain no further energy.

In 1945 McMillan (see
1940) worked out a method
for synchronizing the mag-
netic field in such a way
that the alternations of the
magnetic field slowed and
kept time with the mass in-
crease of the particles. With
such a synchrocyclotron,
particle energies far in ex-
cess of 20 MeV could be
reached, and it became pos-
sible to look to the day
when particle accelerators
might produce particles
with energies in the range
of cosmic ray particles.

The synchrocyclotron
was independently devised
at about the same time by
the Soviet physicist Vladi-
mir Iosifovich Veksler
(1907â€”1966).

Promethium

By now, four elements be-
yond uranium had been dis-
covered, but a single empty
spot still remained in the
periodic table below ura-
nium. This belonged to ele-

 

ment number 61, one of the
lanthanides (see 1940, Nep-
tunium and Plutonium).

In 1945 a group under
the direction of the Ameri-
can chemist Charles Du-
Bois Coryell (b. 1912)
discovered element number
61 among the fission prod-
ucts of uranium. Its most
nearly stable isotope had a
half-life of 17.7 years.

It was eventually
named promethium, be-
cause just as the Greek god
Prometheus had snatched
fire from the nuclear fur-
nace of the Sun, so prome-
thium had been snatched
from the nuclear furnace of
the fissioning uranium
atoms.

With the discovery of
promethium, the periodic
table had no further gaps,
and all that remained was
to discover further ele-
ments beyond the now-
known curiumi (element
number 96).

Viral Mutations

It was well known that mu-
tations occurred in both
plants and animals, and
they had been studied

with care for over half a
century.

In 1945 Luria (see
1942) and, independently,
the American microbiolo-
gist Alfred Day Hershey (b.
1908) showed that bacterio-
phages underwent muta-
tions as well. It is for this

reason that it is so hard to
develop immunity to viral
diseases like flu and the
common cold. Antibodies
might be developed against
a particular strain of the
virus, but then a mutation
will produce a new strain
against which the old anti-
bodies are not effective.

For their work, Luria
and Hershey received
shares of the Nobel Prize
for physiology and medi-
cine in 1969.

Jet Streams

During World War II, both
Japanese and American pi-
lots in high-flying planes be-
came aware of a high-
altitude wind blowing from
west to east. The Japanese,
making the discovery as
early as 1942, used the
wind in an effort to blow
balloon-bombs across the
Pacific Ocean to the United
States. The Americans be-
came aware of the wind
when flying to bomb Japan
in 1944.

By 1945 these high
winds had been recognized
as a permanent feature of
the atmosphere. There were
several bands of such winds
blowing at the troposphere-
stratosphere boundary.
These bands were hundreds
of miles wide and several
miles deep. Speeds of up to
300 miles per hour were
measured.

These were called jet
