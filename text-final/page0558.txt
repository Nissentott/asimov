degrees above absolute zero
(0.5° K), but hope of getting
lower temperatures by
methods such as gas expan-
sion, which had worked till
then, seemed over.

In 1925, however,
Debye (see 1912) suggested
something new. He pointed
out that a paramagnetic
substance (one that concen-
trates magnetic lines of
force) can be placed almost
in contact with liquid he-
lium, separated from it by
helium gas, and the temper-
ature of the whole system
reduced to about 1° K. If
the system is then placed
within a magnetic field, the
molecules of the paramag-
netic substance will line up
parallel to the field's lines
of force and, in doing so,
give off heat. If this heat is
removed by further slight
evaporation of the sur-
rounding helium, and the
magnetic field is then re-
moved, the paramagnetic
molecules will immediately
fall into a random orienta-
tion, absorbing heat as they
do so. Since the only source
of heat will be the liquid he-
lium, its temperature will
consequently drop below
0.5° K.

The same suggestion
was made independently,
soon afterward, by the
American chemist William
Francis Giauque (1895—
1982), but it was not until

 

another decade had passed
that the idea was put into
practice.

Gravitational
Red Shift

Einstein had predicted that
light rising against a gravi-
tational field would lose en-
ergy so that it would
redden slightly (see 1916).
The Sun’s gravitational
field, though intense,

was not intense enough

to show a measurable
effect.

Ten years before, how-
ever, W. S. Adams had
shown that Sirius’s com-
panion star, Sirius B, was
tiny and extraordinarily
dense. Its combination of
large mass and small size
meant it had a gravita-
tional field more than
ten thousand times as
intense as the Sun's, It
should show a gravitational
red shift if, in fact, one
existed.

In 1925 Adams man-
aged to study the spectrum
of the tiny star and de-
tected a red shift close
enough to that predicted by
Einstein to be considered
evidence of the validity of
the theory of general rela-
tivity. As in the case of the
bending starlight, however
(see 1919), it was a border-
line observation.

Rhenium

In 1925 two German chem-
ists, Walter Karl Friedrich
Noddack (1893-1960) and
Ida Eva Tacke (b. 1896), de-
tected a new element with
the atomic number of 75.
They named it rheniwm,
after the Latin name of the
Rhine river.

Although they didn’t
know it at the time, Nod-
dack and Tacke (they were
married the next year) had
discovered the eighty-first
and last element that pos-
sessed stable isotopes. Four
elements between 1 and 92
now remained to be discov-
ered, atomic numbers 43,
61, 85, and 87. Of these, ele-
ments 85 and 87 could be
assumed to be radioactive,
but there seemed no reason
to suppose that elements 43
and 61 were. In fact, Nod-
dack and Tacke announced
the discovery of element 43
at the same time as that of
rhenium. They called ele-
ment 43 masurium, after a
district in eastern Germany.
In the case of this element,
however, their observations
were mistaken.
