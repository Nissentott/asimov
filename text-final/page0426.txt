eling at right angles to the
motion and back. Therefore
the two halves of the light
should rejoin out of phase,
and by measuring the
width of the interference
fringes, one should be able
to measure the speed of
Earth relative to ether.
Once that was known, the
absolute motion of all other
bodies should follow.
However, the experi-
ment failed. No interfer-
ence fringes were found.
Michelson assumed there
was something wrong with
the experiment and set
about refining it. It took
years before he was satis-
fied that there truly were
no interference fringes.
That observation helped
revolutionize science.

Anthrax
Inoculation

It had been three-quarters
of a century since Jenner
had successfully prevented
smallpox by inoculating
people with cowpox, a
much milder disease that
conferred immunity to the

more serious one (see 1796).

This feat could not be re-
peated in other cases be-
cause other serious diseases
did not seem to have
milder cousins. Pasteur de-
cided, however, that one

might be able to manufac-
ture those milder cousins in
the laboratory.

Pasteur studied the
deadly disease anthrax,
which ravaged herds of do-
mestic animals. Koch (see
1876) had reported observ-
ing the bacteria responsible
for the disease. Pasteur con-
firmed Koch's finding and
showed that the germs
sometimes survived in the
ground as heat-resistant
spores for long periods of
time. It was therefore neces-
sary to kill all infected ani-
mals and bury them deep.

If an animal did sur-
vive anthrax, however, it
was immune thereafter.
Pasteur therefore prepared
cultures of anthrax germs
and heated them. In this
way, he destroyed the activ-
ity and virulence of the
germs but left an “attenu-
ated" preparation that
could still produce immu-
nity against anthrax.

In 1881 he carried
through a dramatic experi-
ment. Some sheep were in-
oculated with his
attenuated germs; others
were not. After a time, all
the sheep seemed healthy,
but when they were in-
jected with deadly anthrax
germs, those that had been
inoculated lived; those that
had not been inoculated
died.

Pasteur, in tribute to
Jenner, called the process
vaccination, even though
the disease vaccinia was
not involved.

Pneumococcus

The physician George
Miller Sternberg (1838—
1915) was the American pio-
neer in bacteriology. In
1881 he isolated the bacte-
rium that caused pneumo-
nia. It was a small

spherical bacterium of the
kind called coccus (from a
Greek word meaning
“seed”). The pneumonia-
causing bacterium

was therefore called
preumococcus.

Venn Diagram

In 1881 the British mathe-
matician John Venn (1834—-
1923) extended the work of
Boole on symbolic logic
(see 1847), by representing
logical statements as inter-
secting circles (Venn dia-
grams).

Such circles made it
easier to handle statements
like “All A are B"” or “Some
A are B” or “A can be B or
C but not both.” If Boole's
work was a kind of alge-
braic logic, Venn's was geo-
metric logic.
