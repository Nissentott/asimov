For his work on X rays,
Barkla was awarded the
Nobel Prize in physics in
1917.

Third Law of
Thermodynamics

By now, temperatures as
low as 14 degrees above ab-
solute zero had been
reached with Dewar’s solid
hydrogen (see 1898). It
seemed that the race to
reach absolute zero might
be soon completed.

In 1906, however, the
German physical chemist
Walther Hermann Nernst
(1864—1941) advanced ther-
modynamic reasons for sup-
posing that absolute zero
could not be reached by
any technique. He proposed
that, like the speed of light
in a vacuum, absolute zero
was a limit that could be
approached more and more
closely but never actually
reached. This is sometimes
called the third law of ther-
modynamics, and for this
Nernst was awarded the
Nobel Prize in chemistry in
1920.

Vitamin
Concept

Since Eijkman had found
that beriberi could be
cured by dietary means (see
1896), biochemists had be-
come aware of other exam-

 

ples of dietary-deficiency
diseases.

Hopkins (see 1900) was
convinced that various or-
ganic compounds were
present in the diet that
were essential to life but
needed only in tiny quanti-
ties. In 1906 he made this
point in a lecture and sug-
gested that scurvy and rick-
ets were two diseases that
arose through the lack of
trace substances.

When these trace sub-
stances became known as
vitamins a few years later,
Hopkins was given credit
for having helped give rise
to the vitamin concept, so
that he and Eijkman shared
the Nobel Prize in medicine
and physiology in 1929.

Magnesium and
Chlorophyll

Ever since Pelletier discov-
ered chlorophyll (see 1817),
it had been understood that
the substance was of the ut-
most importance. After all,
it brought about the pro-
duction of food and oxygen
on which animal life, in-
cluding human beings, sub-
sisted. The chemical
structure of chlorophyll
was therefore of devouring
interest to biochemists, but
it was still poorly under-
stood for all that.

The German chemist
Richard Willstatter (1872—
1942), however, managed

to supply a key item of in-
formation about chloro-
phyll structure in 1906. He
showed that each chloro-
phyll molecule contained a
magnesium atom, held in
much the same way that an
iron atom was held by he-
moglobin.

For this and for other
work on planet pigments,
Willstatter was awarded
the Nobel Prize for chemis-
try in 1915.

Chromatography

The Russian botanist Mik-
hail Semenovich Tsvett
(1872—-1919) worked with
plant pigments, which are
made up of a large number
of rather similar organic
compounds, difficult to sep-
arate into individual sub-
stances that can be studied
singly. (This is a difficulty
that frequently arises in
biochemistry.)

In 1906 Tsvett found a
convenient means of sepa-
ration. He let a solution of a
mixture of the pigments
trickle down a tube of pow-
dered aluminum oxide. The
different substances in the
pigment mixture held onto
the surface of the powder
particles but with different
degrees of strength. As the
mixture was washed down-
ward, the substances began
to separate, those holding
with less strength being
washed down farther.

If the tube of alumi-
