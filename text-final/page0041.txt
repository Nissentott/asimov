Coins

Trading originally con-
sisted of barter: you give
me this and I will give you
that. If two people both had
something they didn’t need
that the other badly
wanted, the trade was easy.
Usually, however, both
sides wanted to make sure
they didn't give up some-
thing more valuable for
something less valuable.
Since comparative values
are hard to judge, there
must have been many
times when both traders
felt cheated.

Eventually the custom

arose of using metals, espe-
cially gold, as a medium of
exchange. Gold was b
ful and much to be desired
as ornamentation. It didn't

went a long way. Once ev-

a person could buy an ob-

change it for an object
worth that same amount
In all transactions, it
was then necessary to have
a scale (see 5000 B.c.) that
could be used to weigh lit-
tle odds and ends of gold,
with the usual fears on all
sides that the scale, or the
weights, might be crooked.
In western Asia Minor,
the kingdom of Lydia was
founded about 680 B.c. by
Gyges, who ruled till about

648 B.Cc. Under his son
Ardvs, who ruled from
about 648 10 about 613 B

The development of
coins greatly accelerated
trade, and the idea was so
transparently good that it
was adopted by other gov

Eclipses

In studying the motion of
the planets along the path
of the zodiac, the Babylo-
nian astronomers could not
help but note that some-
times the motions would

bring two of them fairly
close together. This would
be most spectacular in the
case of the Sun and the
Moon. Every once in @
while the Moon would pass
in front of the Sun and ob
scure part or sometimes all

of it. At times, too, the Sun

 

 

 

would be on one side of the
Ear and the Moon would
be directly on the other
The Earth's shadow would
then fall on the Moon, ob
