“star,” because it was try-
ing to duplicate what went
on in stars) that might con-
fine hot hydrogen gas effi-
ciently. Later, a modified
version developed in the So-
viet Union and called a To-
kamnak (an abbreviation of a
descriptive Russian phrase)
was used.

In nearly forty years of
trying, however, nuclear fu-
sion ignition has not been
achieved, though progress
continues to be made.

Hydrogen
Radiation

Van de Hulst had pre-
dicted, from theoretical
considerations, that hydro-
gen atoms in space would
emit microwave radiation
with a wavelength of 21
centimeters (see 1944).

In 1951 Purcell, who
had earlier helped work out
the theory of nuclear mag-
netic resonance (see 1946),
actually detected this radia-
tion coming from outer
space. This demonstrated
the value of radio waves in
detecting the presence of
given atoms and molecules
in interstellar space. The
wavelengths of the radia-
tion emitted were charac-
teristic of different
substances and acted as
“fingerprints.”

Milky Way
Structure

The spiral structure of gal-
axies had first been de-
scribed by Rosse (see 1845),
but the structure of our
own Milky Way Galaxy re-
mained puzzling. Living
within it as we do, we natu-
rally lack the ability to
view it from-without, from
which point of view its
structure would become ob-
vious.

By 1951, however, as-
tronomers could detect
radio wave emissions with
great delicacy, and the
American astronomer Wil-
liam Wilson Morgan (b.
1906) could make out the
characteristic radio waves
of ionized hydrogen coming
from particularly hot,
bright stars that were them-
selves characteristic of the
spiral arms of galaxies.
When several such lines of
ionized hydrogen were
found coming from our gal-
axy, it seemed convincing
evidence that the Milky
Way Galaxy had spiral
arms. Our palaxy was thus
revealed to be a spiral gal-
axy much like the An-
dromeda Galaxy. Our Sun
is located in one of these
spiral arms.

Jupiter XII

Seth Nicholson, who over a
period of nearly four de-
cades had discovered three
of the small outer satellites
of Jupiter, in 1951 discov-
ered a fourth. This was the
twelfth satellite of Jupiter
to be detected and was
therefare referred to as
Jupiter X1I.

Jupiter XII was only 20
miles in diameter and it
eventually received the
name Ananke.

Super-
conductivity
Theory

Four decades had elapsed
since Kamerlingh Onnes
had first discovered the phe-
nomenon of superconduc-
tivity (see 1911). The reason
that some metals and
alloys lost all electrical re-
sistance at temperatures
near absolute zero re-
mained obscure, however.
In 1951 John Bardeen,
who had participated in the
discovery of the transistor
(see 1948), helped work out
a theoretical consideration
of the phenomenon, making
use of quantum effects, that
seemed to explain a good
deal. It was good enough,
in fact, for Bardeen to be
awarded the Nobel Prize
for physies in 1972. Since
