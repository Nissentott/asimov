By the beginning of the
eighteenth century, science
had become separated from
theology, and investigation,
experimentation, and dis-
covery were the order of
the day. Society was in the
grip of a euphoria that
grew out of a widely held
confidence in the scientific
method, which became
identified with human prog-
ress. Public interest in
knowledge was strong
enough by mid-century to
support publication of
Denis Diderot’s Encyclope-
dia, a categorized summary
of information that was the
first of its kind. The design
of experiments was refined,
and both results and the
language used to report
them became more precise.
Greater emphasis was
placed on confirmation by
independent investigators;
the growth of the scientific
societies born in the 1600s
fostered the publication of
findings, discussion, and
general support for their
members’ work. Some of
the most stunning achieve-
ments of the period were in
chemistry. For his work es-
tablishing the importance
of quantitative measure-
ment, Antoine-Laurent La-
voisier is remembered as

the father of modern chem-
istry. In the 1770s, using re-
cent findings of Joseph
Priestley, Lavoisier deter-
mined that the newly iso-
lated gas oxygen was one of
two main components of
air and the key element in
combustion. Joseph Black’s
discovery of carbon dioxide
in 1754 had led to the real-
ization that air was a com-
bination of different gases,
and in 1766 Henry Caven-
dish isolated hydrogen and
determined that it had a
very low density. Other ele-
ments were discovered, in-
cluding cobalt, platinum,
nickel, manganese, chlo-
rine, and molybdenum. In
1735 Carolus Linneaus pub-
lished his Systems of Na-
ture, which classified
European plants (and, in
later editions, animals) so
skillfully that he is called
the father of modern taxon-
omy. A German botanist ex-
plained plant pollination
for the first time in 1763,
and a Dutch experimenter
discovered photosynthesis
in 1779.In 1729 Stephen
Gray, who thought that
electricity was a fluid,
showed that it could travel
through glass, twine, and
other conductors. Experi-
menters in 1745 were (liter-

ally) shocked to learn that
electricity could be stored
in what came to be called a
Leyden jar. In 1752 Benja-
min Franklin flew a kite in
a thunderstorm in a suc-
cessful attempt to prove
that natural electricity and
the electricity generated in
a Leyden jar were one and
the same. Several techno-
logical advances of this pe-
riod foreshadowed the
Industrial Revolution. The
flying shuttle, introduced in
1733, allowed partial mech-
anization of the weaving
process and greatly in-
creased the productivity of
textile workers. When Rich-
ard Arkwright devised the
spinning frame in 1769,
even unskilled workers
could produce woven cloth
much more quickly. In

1709 the process of iron-
smelting was improved
through the use of coke-
fired furnaces. In 1764
James Watt improved on
Newcomen's steam engine
of 1712 when he built a dou-
ble-chambered system, the
first such device that
worked reasonably well. It
was Watt's next improve-
ment on the steam engine
that took history into a radi-
cally new phase.
