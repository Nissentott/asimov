If the distant galaxies
are actually at the distance
estimated, however, it
would seem that the Uni-
verse must be older than
we had thought. Again, any
information we can get
from those distant galaxies
may tell us more about the
formation and youth of gal-
axies, and that may change
our ideas about how and
when the Universe formed.

Shroud of Turin

The Shroud of Turin is a
linen cloth that seems to
possess an image, front and
back, of a bearded, long-
haired man, which resem-
bles the popular conception
of Jesus. It was first dis-
played in France in the
1350s and in 1578 was
taken to Turin, [taly.

Many people believed
it to be the burial sheet of
Jesus with the image pro-
duced by miraculous
means. Others, more skepti-
cal, assumed it to be a forg-
ery produced not long
before it was first shown.

In 1988 some of the
linen was finally tested by

the carbon-14 dating
method worked out by
Libby (see 1947). The re-
sults were clear. The linen
had been part of living flax
plants seven hundred years
ago. The shroud, and pre-
sumably the image upon it,
had been produced not long
before it was first displayed
and was thirteen centuries
too late to have been the
shroud of Jesus.

 

Greenhouse
Effect

It had been known since
Arrhenius (see 1884) had
pointed it out that carbon
dioxide in the atmosphere
acted as a heat trap, mak-
ing Earth's temperature
warmer than it would oth-
erwise be. (This was called
the greenhouise effect.)

[t was also known that
the carbon dioxide content
of the atmosphere had been
rising steadily since 1900,
partly because of the in-
creasing use of coal and oil,
which produce carbon diox-
ide when burned, and
partly because of the cut-

ting down of forests, which
are the most efficient con-
sumers of carbon dioxide.

As it happened, 1987
was the warmest year yet
recorded by weather bu-
reaus, and 1988 was
warmer still, Whatâ€™s more,
1988 saw disastrous
droughts in the United
States and elsewhere.
There was a feeling that the
greenhouse effect was inten-
sifying, and world concern
began to intensify accord-
ingly.

Rising temperatures
would not only alter
Earth's climate (probably
for the worse) but could
promote the melting of
Earth's ice caps to produce
a disastrous rise in sea level
of up to 200 feet. The green-
house effect, plus the thin-
ning of the ozone layer,
the steady rise in environ-
mental pollution, and the
inexorable increase in pop-
ulation, seemed to have
placed the very habitability
of our planet at risk, and a
sense of crisis was begin-
ning to pervade the world.
