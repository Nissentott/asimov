a sensible and logical sys-

was accepted by chemists
over the next couple of de-
cades, and finally chemis-
try had one language,
which it retains to this day.

 

 

 

   

Steamboat

Until this time, steam en-
gines had been used only to
power pumps and textile

machinery. Yet if a steam
engine could turn a paddle
wheel, it could also serve as
a mechanical oar of great
power, which could drive a
ship through water against
both wind and current
without the expenditure of
human muscle (except that
of feeding fuel to the engine
so that steam could be gen-
erated),

The first person to
achieve a workable steam-
boat was the American in-

  

ventor John Fitch (1743~
1798). On August 22, 1787,
his first steamboat navi-
gated the Delaware River
for the first time. For a
while Fitch kept up a regu-
lar schedule of trips from
Philadelphia to Trenton
and back. However, there
were few passengers, the
ship operated at a loss, the
financial backers quit, and
the ship was finally de-
stroyed in a storm in 1792.

 

 

Algebra and
Mechanics

Geometry seemed a natural
way of describing mechan-

ics, but Descartes (see 1637)
had shown that algebra

could deal with geometric
problems.

A French mathemati-
cian, Joseph-Louis La-
grange (1736-1813),
tackled the study of me-
chanics in a totally nongeo-
metric way. Using algebra

and calculus, he worked
out very general equations
by means of which mechan-
ical problems could be
solved.

He summarized his
work in Analytical Mechan-
ics, published in 1788 by a
