Pacemaker

The heart beats regularly,
speeding up when exertion
or emotion increases the ox-
ygen requirements of the
body and slowing down
again in repose. For half a
century, it had been known
that a special patch of cells
in the heart initiated the
beat, and the patch was
called, popularly, the pace-
maker. When the pace-
maker was diseased or
damaged, the heartbeat
could not be maintained
properly and death might
ensue.

Then an artificial pace-
maker was devised that
used a regular electrical
pulse to initiate the heart-
beat. At first such things
were s0 bulky they had to
be carried outside the body.
The first pacemaker that
was compact enough to be
inserted under the skin in
the patient’s chest was de-

vised in 1957 by the Ameri-
can physician Clarence
Walton Lillehei. Pacemak-
€rs are Now Common

tion.

Tunnel Diode

The Japanese physicist Leo
Esaki (b. 1925) was work-
ing with tiny crystal recti-
fiers (semiconductor diodes)
and found, in 1957, that on
occasion their resistance de-
creased with current inten-
sity rather than increasing
as expected. This was
caused by a tunnel effect, an
ability on the part of elec-
trons to penetrate barriers
that were perhaps a hun-
dred atoms thick, as though
they were tunneling
through. Electrons could do
this because they had their
wave aspects and could be,
in their particle aspect, at
any part of the wave. If the
wave extended for a hun-
dred-atom thickness, the
electron could hind itself,
every once in a while, on
the other side of an insulat-
ing barrier, even though
this would have been
thought impossible in clas-
sical physical theory.

The barrier-crossing
electrons could be used for

switching purposes, and
Esaki tunnel diodes were ul-
trasmall and ultrafast. For
his discovery, Esaki re-
ceived a share of the Nobel
Prize for physics in 1973.

Borazon

A boron atom has one less
electron than a carbon
atom, while a nitrogen
atom has one more electron
than a carbon atom. If
boron nitride, with a mole-
cule consisting of one atom
of boron and one of nitro-
gen, is heated and com-
pressed under conditions
that would form diamond
from graphite (see 1955),
the boron nitride takes on
the diamond configuration
too and is then known as bo-
razon. This trick was ac-
complished in 1957.

The electron arrange-
ment in borazon is just as
in diamond. The slight
asymmetry resulting from
the alternation of boron
and nitrogen nuclei keeps
borazon from being quite
as hard as diamond, but bo-
razon is the more useful at
high temperatures. At 900°
C diamond will burn and
turn into carbon dioxide,
but borazon survives un-
changed.
