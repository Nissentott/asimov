As a result, Perutz and
Kendrew shared the Nobel

Homo Habilis

By now it was known that
the two varieties of Homo
sapiens, modern human be-
ings and Neanderthal man
(see 200,000 B.c.), had been
preceded by the smaller-
brained Homo erectus (see
500,000 B.c.), who may first
have appeared on Earth as
much as 1.5 million years
ago. Before that there were
various species of the genus
Australopithecus (see
4,000,000 B.C.).

The australopithe-
cines, whose existence
seems to have overlapped
that of Homo erectus, were
hominids in that they more
closely resembled human
beings than they resembled
any ape, living or extinct.
Nevertheless, they were suf-
ficiently primitive to be
kept out of genus Homo.
Did they develop directly
into Homo erectus, or was
there an intermediate
form?

The British anthropolo-
gist Louis Seymour Bazett
Leakey (1903-1972), to-
gether with his wife, Mary,
carefully explored the Oldu-
vai Gorge in what is now
Tanzania. There, on July

17, 1959, they came across
the first fragments of a
skull that, when pieced to-
gether, seemed to be a relic
of the earliest known repre-
sentative of genus Homo, a
species that came into exis-
tence nearly 2 million years
ago.
This species, intermedi-
ate between the australo-
pithecines and Homo
erectus, was eventually
named Homo habilis
(handy human). Homo habi-
lis seemed to be the first
hominid capable of shaping
stone tools. Until then, all
tools of earlier hominids,
and of nonhominids for
that matter, had been such
things as leaves, twigs,
shells, bones, and unmodi-
fied stones.

Spark Chamber

Bubble chambers (see 1953)
had turned out to be very
useful, especially for the de-
tection of ultra-short-lived
particles, However, they
cannot be triggered by de-
sired events, but record ev-
erything. This means that
myriads of tracks have to
be searched through to find
those of significance. Cloud
chambers could be set for
desired events only, but
were insufficiently sensitive
to show the newer parti-
cles. Something was
needed that would be selec-

 

tive as cloud chambers and
as sensitive as bubble
chambers.

This need was met by
the spark chamber, in which
incoming particles ionized
neon gas that was crossed
by many metal plates. The
ions then conducted an elec-
tric current that showed up
as a visible line of sparks,
marking the passage of the
particles. The device could
be adjusted to react only to
those particles that were
under study.

The first practical
spark chamber was con-
structed in 1959 by two Jap-
anese physicists, Saburo
Fukui and Shotaro Miya-
moto.

Color Vision

For a century it had been
thought that three basic col-
ors were sufficient to repro-
duce the entire color range,
and to combine into white
light. The three colors were
red, green, and blue. These
colors are, in fact, used in
color television to produce
all the other colors. Further-
more, in the retina of the
eye there are three types of
cells, one to react with each
of the three basic colors.

In 1959, however,
Land, who had invented Po-
laroid and the Land camera
(see 1932), advanced a new
theory of color vision. He
