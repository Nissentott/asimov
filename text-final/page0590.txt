which the two particles
were formed. He showed
that there was an interac-
tion involved in connection
with neutrinos that was
like an electromagnetic in-
teraction but much weaker.
It therefore came to be
called the weak interaction.
(It was stronger than the
gravitational interaction,
however.)

The electromagnetic in-
teraction and the gravita-
tional interaction
decreased in intensity with
the square of the distance.
This was a rather slow de-
crease, so that both interac-
tions could make
themselves felt over long
distances. (This was partic-
ularly true of the gravita-
tional interaction, which
was purely attractive,
whereas the electromag-
netic interaction had attrac-
tive and repulsive
components that tended to
cancel each other.)

The weak interaction,
however, fell off so rapidly
with distance that it was
confined entirely to dis-
tances the size of an atomic
nucleus or less. It might
therefore have been called
the nuclear interaction were
it not that another interac-
tion of small range was
soon discovered.

Radioactivity
Ever since Rutherford had
brought about nuclear reac-
tions by bombardment
with subatomic particles
(see 1919), physicists had
been inducing more and
more such reactions,

In 1934 the French
physicists Frédéric Joliot-
Curie (1900-1958) and
Iréne Joliot-Curie (1897—
1956), his wife, who was
also the daughter of Pierre
and Marie Curie (see 1897),
were bombarding alumi-
num atoms with alpha par-
ticles.

In the process of the
bombardment, the nucleus
of the aluminum atom
would absorb an alpha par-
ticle and give off a proton.
The aluminum nucleus con-
tains thirteen protons and
fourteen neutrons, so that it
is aluminum-27. By taking
up an alpha particle (two
protons and two neutrons)
and then giving up a pro-
ton, it ended up with four-
teen protons and sixteen
neutrons, so that it was sili-
con-30, which occurs in na-
ture.

However, after the
bombardment ceased, so
that alpha particles were
no longer absorbed and pro-
tons were no longer given
off, another form of radia-
tion continued. The Joliot-

Curies investigated and de-
cided that in some cases
the aluminum nucleus,
after absorbing the alpha
particle, gave off a neutron.
The result was a net gain of
two protons and one neu-
tron, for a total of fifteen
protons and fifteen neu-
trons, which made it phos-
phorus-30.

Phosphorus-30, how-
ever, does not occur in na-
ture, and it is radioactive,
breaking down with a half-
life of just under 3 minutes
(which is why it doesn’t
occur in nature). In break-
ing down, it gives off a
stream of positrons (parti-
cles that had been discov-
ered by Anderson—see
1932). Each escaping posi-
tron converts a proton to a
neutron, so that phospho-
rus-30 becomes stable silic-
on-30.

The Joliot-Curies were
thus the first to observe ra-
dioactive breakdowns that
emitted positrons and were
the first to produce a radio-
active isotope of an ordi-
narily stable element. This
is called artificial radioactiv-
ity, since it comes about as
the result of bombardment
of nuclei in the laboratory.
Eventually it turned out
that every element that pos-
sessed one or more stable
types of nuclei could also
possess radioactive nuclei
(radioisotopes).
