artists did not derive joy
from their work.

Bows and
Arrows

In some of the early art,
there are clear depictions of
bows and arrows being
used. How old the bow and
arrow are is uncertain, but
they were in use by 20,000
B.C. at least.

The bow and arrow is
an important device be-
cause it is the first one in-
vented by human beings in
which energy is slowly
stored and then released all
at once. It made possible at-
tack from a greater dis-
tance than with a thrown
spear and so was the first
truly long-distance weapon.

12,000 B.C.

The value of attacking an
infuriated animal much
larger than yoursell from as
great a distance as possible
is clear.

Bows and arrows were
eventually used by humans
against other humans (as
has been true of any object
capable of inflicting dam-
age, no matter what the
purpose for which it might
originally have been de-
signed). The bow remained
a prime weapon in warfare
right down to the begin-
ning of the fifteenth cen-
tury.

Oil Lamps

A campfire of burning wood
or brush gives light, but it
is not portable. It cannot
give light precisely where
that light might be needed.

Wood, however, is not the
only possible fuel. People
when roasting meat might
well have noticed that the
fat dripped and flamed.

A smaller fire, then, in
more concentrated form,
might be obtained by dip-
ping some porous wood in
oil and setting it ablaze,
thus forming a torch. Still
more convenient would be
some oil in a container
(a hollowed-out stone, for
instance) with a wick of
some plant fiber inserted
into it. The oil would soak
into the wick and would
burn at its end. It could be
carried from place to place
to suit one's needs.

There are indications
that primitive lamps of this
sort may have been in use
as long ago as 20,000 B.c.

 

Animal
Domestication

In the 1950s, fossil remains
of dogs were found along
with remains of humans in
caves near Kirkuk in what
is now northern Iraq. They
dated from about 12,000
B.C.

How dogs came to be
domesticated is not known,
of course. My own guess is
that, again, children were

responsible. A child could
form a close bond with a
puppy that had been found
abandoned, or that was left
over when the mother was
killed either in self-defense
or for food. Once the bond
was formed, the child
would object strenuously to
the use of the puppy as
food, and parents might
oblige.

It would quickly have
turned out that dogs, being
hunters and pack animals,

will accept a human master
as the pack leader. Dogs
would go hunting with
their masters, help in kill-
ing the game, wait for the
human beings to take what
they wanted, and be satis-
fied to be thrown a minor
share.

In this way human be-
ings, for the first time, ob-
tained the services of
another species of animal.

By 10,000 8.c., another
step had been taken, with
