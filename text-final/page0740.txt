DNA and
Human
Evolution

DNA molecules change
with time, forming muta-
tions (see 1937). Presum-
ably, if the DNA molecules
of two different species are
compared, then the more
closely related the speci
are, the fewer the differ-
ences. And from the num-
ber of differences, one can
tell, perhaps, the length of
time it has taken the two
species to differentiate
from a common ancestor

 

Since the mutations are the

result of chance changes,
conclusions cannot be

drawn with mathematical
certainty, but they are sug-
gestive.

In 1984 such DNA anal-
ysis was used to present rea-
sons for supposing that
human beings and chim-
panzees were more closely
related to each other, evolu-
tionarily, than either was
to gorillas or orangutans,
and that human beings and
chimpanzees diverged from
a common ancestor some
five to six million years
ago.

 

Brown Dwarfs

In 1984 the red dwarf star
Van Biesbroeck 8 was re-
ported to have a still dim-

mer companion star. The
companion was so small
and dim that it seemed it
could not be massive
enough, or bright enough,
to be shining by ordinary
nuclear fusion. It was mod-
erately heated to the point
of just glowing, and it gave
off radiation rich in infra-
red, by other types of nu-
clear reactions, perhaps.

If it were totally cold
and didn't radiate in the
visible region at all, it
would be a black dwarf.
Since it wasn'â€™t totally cold,
it was called a brown dwarf.
The existence of this partic-
ular brown dwarf was later
disputed, but other exam-
ples were reported.
