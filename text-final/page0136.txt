two pendulums of equal
length and swung one in
larger, one in smaller
sweeps. They kept together
and he found he was cor-
rect.

Nevertheless, when in
later life Galileo conducted
experiments in which it
was necessary to know the
time elapsed, he had to con-
tinue to use his pulse or
dripping water. Not for an-
other seven decades would
the steady beat of the pen-
dulum be put to use as a de-
vice to help measure time.

Siberia
Despite Russia's vast extent

over eastern Europe, its
long sleep under the Mon-

gols had left it technologi-
cally backward. On
Russia’s western bound-
aries were the Swedes, the
Poles, and the Germans,
with none of whom Russia
could compete militarily.
Toward the east, how-
ever, were vast spaces that
at the moment contained
no formidable enemy. This
was also a cold region that
would ordinarily not seem
very enticing except that,
as in Russia’s European
north, there were animals
living there whose pelts,
adapted to the Arctic cold,
were thick and valuable.
In 1581, as Ivan IV’s
reign approached its end,
the Stroganovs, a Russian
family that had made a for-

tune in the fur trade, em-
ployed a Cossack named
Yermak Timofievich (?—
1584) to explore eastward
and expand the Stroganov
fur trade. Yermak con-
quered a Mongol kingdom
east of the Urals, named
Sibir. The name (Siberia in
English) came to be applied
to the entire northern third
of Asia. This was the begin-
ning of a process that
would eventually lead the
Russians to the Pacific
Ocean and put an end for-
ever to the raids of central
Asian nomads against the
settled regions to its south
and west.

Gregorian
Calendar

The Julian calendar,
adopted by Julius Caesar
(see 46 B.C.), was not quite

correct. It assumed a year
that was 365.25 days long,
but the year was more
nearly 365.2422 days long.
If the year were exactly
365.25 days long, that extra
quarter-day could be made

up for by adding an extra
day every fourth year. Then
every fourth year would be
366 days long (leap year),
and in the space of 400
years there would be 100
leap years.
