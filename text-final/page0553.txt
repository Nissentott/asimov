Cepheids, which meant
that Hubble could deter-
mine the distance of the
nebula using the technique
worked out by Leavitt (see
1912).

Hubble’s calculations
showed that the Andro-
meda nebula was 750,000
light-years away, although
eventually this turned out
to be a substantial underes-
timate. Even so, the dis-
tance was great enough to
indicate that the Andro-
meda nebula was rnot part
of our galaxy but existed
far beyond it and must be
an independent galaxy.
From that time on, it was
termed the Andromeda
Galaxy, and it came to be
understood that the Uni-
verse consisted of numer-
ous galaxies, as many
as a hundred billion per-
haps.

For the first time, the
general structure of the Uni-
verse came to be under-
stood, and it was realized
that its size was far, far
greater than had been
thought.

Hafnium

Hevesy, who had intro-
duced the notion of radioac-
tive tracers (see 1918),
managed to reduce further

the small number of still
missing elements. In collab-
oration with a Dutch physi-
cist, Dirk Coster (1889—
1950), Hevesy used an X-
ray analysis method
worked out by Coster and
discovered hafunium, from
the Latin name for Copen-
hagen. It is not a particu-
larly rare element, but it is
very like zirconium, which
is just above it in the peri-
odic table, and it is never
found except in association
with zirconium, which is
fifty times as common, so
that hafnium is hard to sep-
arate out.

Hafnium has an atomic
number of 72, and its dis-
covery reduced the number
of still-missing elements be-
tween 1 and 92 to five,

Ultracentrifuge

Materials that ordinarily re-
main in suspension in
water, due to the incessant
battering of surrounding
molecules, can be made to
settle out by means of a cen-
trifugal effect. Instruments
called centrifuges whirl sus-
pensions and force the sus-
pended material to the side
of the vessel away [rom the
center of rotation. In this
way, red blood corpuscles
can be separated from

blood, and cream from
milk. (Since cream is less
dense than the watery por-
tion of milk, it collects on
the inner side of the vessel,
closer to the center of rota-
tion.)

Ordinary centrifuges
do not produce effects large
enough to force colloidal
particles smaller than red
blood corpuscles or drop-
lets of cream to settle out.
But the Swedish chemist
The Svedberg (1884-1971)
developed an ultracentrifuge
in 1923, which spun so
quickly it developed effects
equivalent to a gravity hun-
dreds of thousands of times
normal.

At such high rates of
spin, the centrifugal effect
can force ordinary protein
molecules to settle out, and
since mixtures of different
types of proteins settle at
different rates (the greater
the molecular weight, the
faster the rate of settling),
different proteins can to
some extent be separated in
this way.

The rate of settling al-
lowed the molecular
weights of proteins to be de-
termined with reasonable
accuracy, and for this work
Svedberg was awarded the
Nobel Prize for chemistry
in 1926.
