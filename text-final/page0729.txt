could live in these sur-
roundings by obtaining en-
ergy from the oxidation of
sulfur compounds present
in the spewings. Other life
forms could live on the bac-
teria, so that at the other
end of the food chain, large
clams and tube-worms
were supported.

Here was an entire soci-
ety that lived on chemical
change involving neither
light nor photosynthesis.
That such complex life
forms could exist indepen-
dently of photosynthesis
had not been expected.

Independent research
at this time discovered
primitive forms of bacterial
life that obtained energy by
reducing carbon dioxide to
methane. These methano-
gens live independently of
oxygen.

Obviously bacterial life
is tremendously versatile.

Lucy

In 1977 the American pale-
ontologist Donald Johanson
discovered a hominid fossil
that was perhaps four mil-
lion years old. Enough
bones were dug up to make
up about 40 percent of a
complete skeleton. It was
an australopithecine (see
1924), about 3'% feet tall. Its
scientific name was Austral-
opithecus afarensis, but
since it was clearly the skel-

 

eton of a female, it was
named, whimsically, Lucy.
The most interesting
thing about Lucy is that she
was obviously bipedal.
From her hip and thigh-
bones it is clear that she
walked erect as easily as we
do. It may be that this bipe-
dal locomotion was the first
adaptation that served to
differentiate organisms
that are more humanlike
(hominids) from those that
are more apelike (pongids).

Nonbacterial
DNA

Bacterial DNA, which is
easy to work with, is
densely packed with mean-
ingful genes. In other
words, every part of bacte-
rial DNA can be used as a
blueprint for the synthesis
of proteins. This is not sur-
prising, since bacterial cells
are much smaller than the
cells of plants or animals,
and there is no space to
waste within them.

In 1977 it was discov-
ered that the DNA in non-
bacterial cells is not
densely packed with genes.
Much of the DNA molecule
consists of stretches of nu-
cleotides that appear to be
meaningless and in any
case are not used to manu-
facture proteins. Nonbacte-
rial cells are large and can

afford such waste, but it is
hard to believe that they
would. Nevertheless, if the
“nonsense'’ portions of non-
bacterial DNA have signifi-
cance and purpose, what it
is has yet to be discovered.

Smallpox and
AIDS

In 1977 the last case of
smallpox was recorded, in
Semalia. The smallpox
virus is now thought to be
extinct except for samples
grown in laboratories for re-
search purposes.

The ending of one
scourge, however, seemed
to have been balanced by
the coming of another. In
1977 two male homosexu-
als in New York City were
found to have a rare form
of cancer, which was even-
tually recognized to be a
symptom of a disease
called acquiived immune de-
ficiency syndrome, usually
abbreviated AIDS. This dis-
ease, usually fatal and so
far incurable, spread rap-
idly and became as feared
in the 1980s as smallpox
was in the 1780s.

Fiber Optics

Fiber optics (see 1970) were
used for the first time in ex-
perimental telephone set-
ups and worked. Within a
