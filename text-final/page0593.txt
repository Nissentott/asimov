Uranium-235

Since the concept of iso-
topes had been advanced
by Soddy (see 1913), almost
all the stable isotopes had
been discovered, thanks to
the work of Aston and his
mass spectograph (see 1919
and 1925).

Nevertheless, it was
not till 1935 that uranium
was found to consist of two
isotopes in its natural state.
The common form had a nu-
cleus made up of 92 protons
and 146 neutrons, so that it
was uranium-238. In 1935
the Canadian-born Ameri-
can physicist Arthur Jeffrey
Dempster (1886—1950)
showed that there was also
another isotope, making up
only 1 out of 140 uranium
atoms, that had a nucleus

containing 92 protons and
143 neutrons, so that it was
uranium-235.

There was no way of
telling at the time of its dis-
covery how enormously im-
portant uranium-235 was,
but the demonstration
came within a few

  

Isotopic Tracers

Hevesy had first used radio-
active atoms as tracers in
biochemical work (see
1918). However, he had
used radioactive lead, and
lead is not a natural compo-
nent of tissue, so that its
presence might well have
interrupted the natural
flow of chemical reactions
there

Since then, however, it
had been found that ele-

  

ments that were not radio-
active were also made up of
isotopes. In particular, the
four most common and im-
portant elements of tissue
each existed also as an iso-
tope that was relatively
rare, quite stable, and capa-
ble of being differentiated
from the common isotope.
Thus there was carbon-13,
which was 8.5 percent
more massive than the ¢
mon carbon-12; nitrogen-
15,7.1 percent more mas-
sive than the common nitro-
gen-14; oxygen-18, 12.5
percent more massive than

16;

 

  
 

the common oxygen
and hydrogen-2, 1
cent more massive th
common hydrogen-1
