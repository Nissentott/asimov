Cometary Cloud

It had been clear for at
least a century that comets
were comparatively short-
lived phenomena. At every
approach to the Sun, a sub-
stantial quantity of a
comet’s mass must evapo-
rate, never to return (as-
suming it to be a “dirty
snowball”"—see 1949). Even
a large comet could only en-
dure a few thousand re-
turns to the neighborhood
of the Sun, and some com-
ets had actually been seen
to fragment on their pas-
sage past the Sun.

Why then were not all
comets long since gone? It

seemed to the Dutch astron-
omer Jan Hendrik Oort (b.
1900) that a vast reservoir
of them must exist. In 1950
he suggested that a huge
spherical cloud of icy com-
ets, perhaps a hundred bil-
lion of them altogether,
must exist within an area 1
to 2 light-years from the
Sun. They might represent
the outermost material
from the original nebula,
left behind by the conden-
sation of the inner mate-
rial into the Sun and the
planets 4.6 billion years
ago and unchanged ever
since.

Every once in a while,
sions or the gravita-

 

 

tional pull of one of the
nearer stars might alter ro-
tational velocities and
allow a comet to fall into
the inner Solar System,
where observers on Earth
could see it. Qort estimated
that perhaps 20 percent of
the original cloud had thus
been hurled inward (or out-
ward into interstellar
space), but an ample num-
ber remained to supply
more comets for the indefi-
nite future.

No direct evidence of
this cometary cloud (some-
times called the Oor7 cloud)
exists, but the notion
