the speed of light since

Roemer’s a half-century be-

fore (see 1675) and it was a
more accurate measure-
ment. Bradley’s figure was
176,000 miles per second,
only 5 percent less than the
true value.

What’s more, the exis-
tence of light aberration
was just as strong a proof
that the Earth was moving
as the existence of stellar
parallax would have been.

Bering Strait

As Peter I's reign drew to-
ward its close, the Russian
occupation of Siberia was
complete. The question re-

mained, though, of whether

there was a land connec-
tion between Siberia and
North America. Peter com-
missioned a Danish naviga-
tor, Vitus Jonassen Bering
(1681-1741), to look into it.

In 1725 Bering crossed
Siberia overland and
reached Kamchatka, which
he was the first to map.
From Kamchatka, he sailed
north in 1728 and reached
the ice of the Arctic Ocean
without sighting land. He
had sailed through what is
now known as the Bering
Strait, which separates Si-
beria from Alaska. The sea
to the south is the Bering
Sea.

Finally, two and a quar-
ter centuries after Colum-

bus (see 1492), it was
shown definitely that North
America was not part of
Asia.

Dentistry

The first book to be devoted
entirely to dentistry ap-
peared in 1728. It was Le
chirurgien dentiste (The
Dental Surgeon), and it was
written by a French dentist,
Pierre Fauchard (1678-
1761). He discussed artifi-
cial dentures and crowns
and described how to treat
caries by cleaning out the
decay and making use of
metal fillings. Because of
this, Fauchard is consid-
ered the father of dentistry.

Electrical
Conductance

The interest in static elec-

tricity produced by Hauks-
bee’s friction machine (see
1706) began to bring about
results. An English experi-
menter, Stephen Gray

(1666—1736), found that
when he electrified a long
glass tube, the corks at the
end were also electrified
even though they had not
been touched. The elec-
tricity, whatever it was,
had clearly traveled from
the glass into the corks.
Gray thought, therefore,

that electricity was a
fluid.

He experimented fur-
ther, causing the electrical
fluid to travel through long
stretches of twine (as long
as 800 feet). He found that
the fluid flowed more easily
through some substances
than through others. This
