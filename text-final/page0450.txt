Antitoxin

A microorganism itself may
not be the immediate cause
of a disease, but some sub-
stance it produces may be
(a toxin, from a Greek word
for “poison”). An organism
stricken with the disease
then produces a substance
(an antitoxin) capable of
neutralizing the toxin. If
the organism recovers, the
antitoxin present in its
bloadstream confers immu-
nity to the disease thereaf-
ter.

 

A German bacteriolo-
t, Emil Adolf von Beh-
ring (1854-1917), decided
in 1890 that it might be pos-
sible to produce an immu-
nity against tetanus, in an
animal, by injecting into it
graded doses of blood
serum from another animal
suffering from tetanus.
Enough of the serum would
be given to induce anti-

 

 

 

toxin formation, but not
enough to cause it to die.

It was found that the
animal thus immunized
could then be used as a
source of antitoxin that
could confer at least tempo-
rary immunity on still an-
other animal, or in a
human being.

Behring tried this also
in the case of diphtheria, a
disease that was in those
days common among chil-
dren and often fatal. The
diphtheria antitoxin, once
marketed, not only con-
ferred a certain immunity,
but helped defeat the dis-
case even after it had estab-
lished itself.

For this work, Behring
received the Nobel Prize for
physiology and medicine in
1901, the first year in which
Nobel Prizes were awarded.

 

Java Man

The skeletal remains of Ne-
anderthal man had been un-
covered thirty-four years
earlier (see 1856), but al-
though the Neanderthals
possessed some primitive
features, they had brains as
large as our own. A truly
primitive human ancestor
had not yet been discov-
ered.

By this time, though,
the anthropoid apes were
well known, and a Dutch
paleontologist, Marie Eu-
gene Francois Thomas Du-
bois (1858—1941), believed
that primitive human be-
ings would be found where
the anthropoid apes now
were: in sections of Africa |
and southeast Asia. He |
could not easily reach Af-
rica, but the Indonesian is-
lands were Dutch territory,
and Dubois, who was serv-
ing in the army, managed
