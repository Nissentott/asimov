plate tectonics, and it has to-
tally revolutionized geol-
ogy, explaining a great deal
that had been mysterious
before.

There are six large tec-
tonic plates and a number
of smaller ones, and it is
along the boundaries of the
plates that Earth’s quakes
and volcanoes seem to be
concentrated. One plate,
which includes most of the
Pacific Ocean, and with
boundaries of the eastern
coast of Asia and the west-
ern coast of America, ac- .
counts for about 80 percent
of the earthquake energy re-
leased on Earth.

Bubble
Chambers

At this time the most famil-
iar device for detecting the
paths of subatomic parti-
cles was the cloud chamber
invented by Wilson (see
1911). The American physi-
cist Donald Arthur Glaser
(b. 1926) thought of re-
versing its principle.

In the cloud chamber,
you have humid air on the
point of forming small
droplets of liquid. What if
you started, instead, with a
liquid that was on the point
of boiling and forming
small bubbles of vapor? In
the cloud chamber, a speed-
ing charged particle would
encourage the formation of
droplets, and a line of drop-

lets would mark out its
path. In this new bubble
chamber, a speeding
charged particle would en-
courage the formation of
bubbles, and a line of bub-
bles would mark out its
path.

Since liquids are
denser than gases, a speed-
ing particle will slow more
quickly in a bubble cham-
ber than in a cloud cham-
ber, curve more intensely,
and reveal its properties
more clearly. Then, too,
there will be more colli-
sions in the bubble cham-
ber—more events will take
place. Finally, if liquid hy-
drogen is used as the liquid,
it will consist, for the most
part, of electrons and single
protons, and the simplicity
of the background will
make the results easier to
interpret.

By 1953 Glaser had
made his bubble chamber a
practical reality and they
have been an indispensable
tool of subatomic investiga-
tions ever since. Glaser re-
ceived the Nobel Prize for
physics in 1960 as a result.

Strange
Particles

Kaons and hyperons are
subject to the strong inter-
action and are formed in
ways that involve the
strong interaction. It would
seem that they ought to

break down by the strong
interaction too, but they
don't; they break down far
more slowly by way of the
weak interaction.

This is not to say that
they break down slowly in
any absolute sense—it
takes just under a billionth
of a second—Dbut if they
broke down by way of the
strong reaction, it would
only take a billionth of a bil-
lionth of a second. That
they break down so slowly
seemed strange, and they
came to be called strange
particles.

In 1953 the American
physicist Murray Gell-
Mann (b. 1929) tried to
make sense out of this
strangeness. He studied the
properties of groups of two
or three hadrons that dif-
fered only in the nature of
their electric charge and as-
signed each group a kind of
average electric charge.

In this way he was able
to demonstrate that each
group had a special prop-
erty, which he called
strangeness, that depended
on the properties of the av-
erage clectric charge. In the
most familiar hadrons,
such as the proton, neu-
tron, and pion, the strange-
ness number was 0 and the
property was negligible.
For kaons and hyperons,
however, the strangeness
number was not 0 but +1,
-1, +2,0r — 2.
