near completion in 1957

Details of
Photosynthesis

It was much harder to
study photosynthesis in de-
tail than many other reac-
tion systems that proceed
in living tissue. Photosyn-
thesis will only work in in-
tact chloroplasts, so that
one must deal with reason-
ably intact living plant
cells rather than with
extracts or chopped-up
preparations. Then, too,
photosynthesis works so
rapidly that it would seem
almost beyond hope to see
what was happening.

However, the biochemi-
cal techniques that had
been developed over the
past two decades made it
possible. The American bio-
chemist Melvin Calvin (b.
1911) subjected plant cells
to carbon dioxide labeled
with carbon-14, allowing
exposure for no more than
seconds before mashing
and killing the cells. He
then subjected the contents
to paper chromatography.
Substances containing car-
bon-14 were separated and
studied.

Progress was slow, but
little by little, Calvin and
his group discovered and
isolated the intermediate
products, deduced how
they must fit together, and
built up a scheme of photo-
synthesis that made sense.

By 1957 the main
strokes were filled out with
detail, and Calvin was
awarded the Nobel Prize
for chemistry in 1961 as a
result.

Gibberellins

There are plant hormones
that encourage growth, dif-
ferentiation of tissue, bud-
ding, flowering, and so on.
One group of these, the gib-
berellins, had been isolated
from a fungus of the genus
Gibberella (hence their
name), They were studied
first in Japan before World
War II, but it was not until
1957 that an awareness of
the compounds reached the
west. Gibberellins are used
to increase the size of
plants, particularly in the
cultivation of grapes.

Interferon

In 1957 a group headed by
the British bacteriologist
Alick Tsaacs (1921-1967)
showed that, under the
stimulus of a virus inva-
sion, cells would liberate a
protein with antiviral prop-

erties. It would counter not
only the virus that stimu-
lated the production but
other viruses as well. The
protein, produced more
quickly than antibodies,
was named interferoi.

Unfortunately, though
the interferons are pro-
duced by many species,
each species has its own.
Only human interferon will
work well in human beings,
and humans produce it
only in traces.

Sabin Vaccine

The Salk vaccine had been
proved effective against
poliomyelitis (see 1954).
However, the Salk vaccine
consisted of dead virus that
had to be injected, and
whose ability to stimulate
antibody production might
not be long-lasting. The
Polish-American microbiol-
ogist Albert Bruce Sabin (b.
1906) thought it might be
possible to find strains of
polio that were too feeble
to produce the disease even
while alive but that would
activate antibody forma-
tion and continue to do so
as long as they remained

in the body. Such live
strains could be taken by
mouth.

When Sabin thought he
had the proper strains,
judging by animal experi-
ments, he tried them first
