Art

Sometime after 50,000 B.c.,
a variety of Neanderthal ex-
isted with less pronounced
eyebrow ridges, even in
male adults, with a high
forehead and a distinct
chin, and with smaller
teeth. In short, this was the
kind of hominid, quite ex-
actly, that we are. We are
Homo sapiens sapiens, and
we are sometimes referred
to as modern man, though
modern human beings is
more appropriate terminol-
ogy to make it clear that
men, women, and children
are meant and not only
men.

Between 50,000 B.c.
and 30,000 B.c., the two va-
rieties of Homo sapiens co-
existed, but by the latter
date, some interbreeding
and probably a great deal
of slaughter had put an end
to the Neanderthals, so that
for the last thirty thousand
years or so, all living homi-
nids have been of the mod-
ern type.

Modern human beings
were extremely successful.
For the first time, they ex-
tended the range beyond
where Homo erectus had
left it. Between 40,000 B.c.
and 30,000 B.c., human be-
ings took advantage of the

existence of land bridges
that the fall in sea level had
produced. They entered
Australia from southeast-
ern Asia, and North
America from northeastern
Asia. No hominids had ex-
isted in either continent be-
fore. They also found their
way to the Japanese is-
lands.

The new lands were
steadily overrun, and by
10,000 B.c. human beings
had reached the southern-
most part of South
America, and even Tierra
del Fuego, the island to the
south of that continent. All
the continental areas ex-
cept Antarctica and the gla-
ciated areas in the north
were settled.

Human beings were
hunters, of course, and they
had developed rituals to im-
prove their success. One,
apparently, was to draw
pictures of animals being
successfully hunted, in the
conviction, perhaps, that
life would imitate art, or
that the spirits that ani-
mated animals would be
mollified in this way and
would cooperate.

In 1879, a Spanish ar-
chaeologist, Marcellino de
Sautuola (d. 1888), was ex-
cavating Altamira Cave in
northern Spain, when his

twelve-year-old daughter,
who was with him, spied
paintings on the ceiling and
cried out “‘Bulls! Bulls!”
There were paintings of
bison, deer, and other ani-
mals in red and black,
drawn perhaps as long ago
as 20,000 B.c.

The drawings spoke
highly of the artists’ skill. If
anything were needed to
show that early human be-
ings were our intellectual
equals, this would do. In
the last twenty millennia,
we have gained enormous
knowledge and experience,
but we are not one whit
more human than those an-
cient cave artists.

So excellent was the
art, in fact, that many peo-
ple refused to believe it was
truly ancient. Many felt it
to be a fraud of some sort, a
modern hoax. It was only
with the finding of other
caves and other cave paint-
ings that the art was finally
accepted as ancient.

The cave paintings
were found in remote
places and were invisible
except by artificial light, so
that it is believed they were
drawn for religious and rit-
ualistic purposes rather
than for display. Neverthe-

less, they are clearly the re-

sult of infinite pains, and it
