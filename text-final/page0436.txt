One bottleneck, how-
ever, was the setting of
type. Plucking out an indi-
vidual letter and setting it
in line was time-consum-

ing.

In 1884 a German-born
American inventor, Ottmar
Mergenthaler (1854-1899),
patented a machine that,
when directed by an opera-
tor at a keyboard, could set
a whole line of type at one
time. [t was therefore
called a Linotype machine.
For the next three-quarters
of a century it was a main-
stay of publishingâ€”espe-
cially newspapers, which
increasingly had to be
turned out steadily and in
quantity.

 

 

Fountain Pen

Through most of history,
those in the West have been
writing with pen and ink.
The pens advanced from
feather quills to steel, but
always they had to be
dipped into the inkwell
every few moments. This
was tedious and led to a
great number of ink blots
and ink spills and tended to
turn hands, face, and
clothes inky as well.

In 1884 an American in-
ventor, Lewis Edson Water-
man (1837-1901), patented
a pen with a reservoir that
could be filled with ink.
The pen could then write
for a long time before an-

other filling was called for.
The reservoir held a virtual
fountain of ink, and before
long the fountain pen, with
further improvements, had
replaced the dip pen almost
everywhere. Even the type-
writer (see 1867) did not
completely remove the
need for writing, after all.
