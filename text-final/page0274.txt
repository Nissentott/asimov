called the nebular hypothe-
sis. It proved very popular
with astronomers for a
time.

Heptadecagon

Though Greek astronomy,
physics, chemistry, medi-
cine, and geography had all
been replaced since the be-
ginning of the Scientific
Revolution, Greek geome-
try had remained staunch
and firm.

In 1796, however, a
young German mathemati-

cian, Carl Friedrich Gauss
(1777-1855), worked out a
method for constructing a
heptadecagon (a polygon
built up of seventeen sides
of equal lengths and some-
times called a seventeen-
gon in consequence), using
a compass and straightedge
only. The Greeks had
missed that construction,
and Gauss's feat was con-
sidered the first notable ad-
dition to geometry since
ancient times.

But Gauss did more
than simply find a method

of construction. He showed
that only polygons of cer-
tain numbers of sides could
be constructed with com-
pass and straightedge
alone. An equilateral hepta-
gon (a polygon with seven
equal sides) could not be
constructed in this fashion.
This was the first case of a
geomietric construction
being proved impossible.
From this point on, the
proof of impossibility in
mathematics grew increas-
ingly important.

 

Chromium

A French chemist, Louis-
Nicolas Vauquelin (1763—
1829), had prudently left
France during the Terror

but had returned after
Robespierre’s execution
(see 1794). In 1797 he was
working with a mineral
from Siberia and isolated
from it a new metal, which

he named chromium from
the Greek word for “color,”
because of the many colors
of its compounds.
