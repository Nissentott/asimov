Atomic Theory

From the time of Robert
Boyle's experiments on the
compression of gas (see
1662), the evidence for the
atomic nature of matter
had been accumulating.

In 1803 an English
chemist, John Dalton
(1766—1844), advanced a
summary of atomic think-
ing, backing it up with the
evidence that had accumu-
lated, including particu-
larly Proust’s law of
definite proportions and his
own investigations of the
way in which gases be-
haved. (In 1808 he gave his
arguments formally in a
book entitled New System of
Chemical Philosophy.)

Essentially, Dalton re-
turned to the Greek notions
of Democritus (see 440 B.C.)
that all matter was made
up of tiny, indivisible parti-
cles. Dalton even used De-
mocritus’s word atom for
these particles. The differ-
ence was that Democritus’s
theory was based on specu-
lation only, whereas Dal-
ton’s was based on a
century and a half of
careful chemical observa-
tion.

The Greeks, being ge-
ometers, naturally thought

 

that atoms differed among
themselves in shape. Dal-
ton, in whose time weight
and measurements had
grown important, main-
tained that the difference
was one of weight, and he
pioneered the concept of
atomic weight.

For instance, 8 grams
of oxygen will combine
with 1 gram of hydrogen to
form 9 grams of water. Sup-
pose that water is formed
through a combination of
one atom of oxygen and one
atom of hydrogen (the re-
sult would be a water mole-
cule). In that case, one atom
of oxygen would have to be
eight times as massive as
one atom of hydrogen. If hy-
drogen was supposed to
have an atomic weight of
1, oxygen would have one
of 8.

Of course, water might
be made up of molecules
containing any number of
oxygen and hydrogen
atoms. Dalton supposed it
to be built up of one of each
merely because that was
the simplest possible situa-
tion. Until such time as
more was known about mo-
lecular makeup, the values
obtained for atomic
weights would be dubious.
In Dalton’s table of atomic

 

weights (the first ever com-
piled), many were indeed
wide of the mark.

Meteorites

Chladni had forced scien-
tists to consider the possi-
bility of meteorites
seriously (see 1794). Contin-
uing reports of stones fall-
ing from heaven forced
investigation, A French
physicist, Jean-Baptiste
Biot (1774-1862), was
asked to look into reports of
such falls in a region 100
miles west of Paris.

After a painstaking in-
vestigation, Biot gave it as
his opinion that the reports
were correct and that mete-
orites did exist and did fall
from the sky. Presumably,
the discovery of the first
two asteroids had forced
scientists to understand
that small bodies might be
moving about the Sun and
that some might occasion-
ally collide with the Earth.

Cerium,
Osmium,
Iridium

New elements were being

discovered rapidly. In 1803
