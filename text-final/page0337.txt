Distance of
Stars

Since the Earth moves
around the Sun, the nearer
stars should show a paral-
lactic displacement com-

pared with the farther ones.

Bradley, when trying to de-
tect stellar parallax, had
discovered light aberration
instead (see 1728). Her-
schel, in the same attempt,
had discovered binary stars
instead (see 1781).

The trouble was, the
stellar parallax was so
small that not till the 1830s
did telescopes become suf-
ficiently refined to detect it.
At this time, the British as-
tronomer Thomas Hender-

son (1798-1844) measured
the parallax of Alpha Cen-
tauri from his observatory
at Capetown in South Af-
rica. (Alpha Centauri was
so far south that it could
not be observed from Eu-
rope.) The German astrono-
mer Friedrich Georg
Wilhelm von Struve (1793—
1864), while working in
Russia, measured the paral-
lax of Vega.

Alpha Centauri is the
third-brightest star in the
sky, and Vega the fourth-
brightest, so there was a
chance they were compara
tively close. The German as-
tronomer Friedrich
Wilhelm Bessel (1784
1846) chose the star 61
Cygni, which was rather

 

dim but had the fastest
proper motion (the appar-
ent shift in position across
the sky) then known, so
that it was likely to be
close, too.

Henderson was the first
to complete the determina-
tion, but Bessel was the
first to publish, in 1838,
and it is he who gets the
credit. His star, 61 Cygni
turned out to be about 3
quadrillion miles away
This distance is so mighty
that even light takes 6
years to reach us from 61
Cygni—so that it is
vears away. Alpha Centauri
is only 4.3 lig
and it is actually the sta
