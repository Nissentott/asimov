he advanced his findings
concerning the circulation
of the blood: It leaves the
right ventricle, goes to the
lungs, and returns to the
left ventricle. It then leaves

the left ventricle, goes to
the body generally, and re-
turns to the right ventricle
to begin all over.

The book was received
sourly by the medical pro-

fession, but Harvey lived
long enough to see it ac-
cepted. His book represents
the beginning of modern
physiology.

Galileo had long accepted
the Copernican idea of a he-
liocentric planetary system,
but he was reluctant to be
open in this view, for the pa-
pacy was strong in Italy
and geocentrism was the
only allowable astronomi-
cal view in Catholic doc-
trine of the time.

Urban VIII (1568—
1644) had become Pope in
1623, and Galileo thought
him to be a friend. In 1632,
therefore, he took the

chance of publishing a book
with the title, in English,
Dialogue on the Two Chief
World Systems. The dia-
logue has three actors: a
Ptolemy-supporter, a Co-
pernicus-supporter, and a
neutral person seeking in-
formation.

The book created a stir.
In the first place, it was
written in Italian rather
than in Latin, so that it was
not confined to scholars but
could reach the general
public. In the second place,
Galileo was a brilliant
writer, much given to sar-
casm, and he certainly gave

the Copernican the best of
it. What's more, it was easy
to persuade the Pope that
the Ptolemy-supporter was
meant to be a satire on him
personally.

Galileo was therefore
brought before the Inquisi-
tion in the most famous
confrontation between sci-
ence and religion prior to
the evolution controversy
in the present century.

On June 22, 1633,
under the threat (but not
the use) of torture, he was
forced to renounce any of
his views that were at vari-
ance with geocentrism.
