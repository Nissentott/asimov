contributing its single elec-
tron to a shared pair.

It turned out that quan-
tum mechanics explained
the properties and behavior
of the hydrogen molecule
neatly. This was the begin-
ning. Eventually quantum
mechanics was applied to
every facet of chemistry,
greatly advancing our
understanding of the
subject and making it, to
some degree, a branch
of physics.

Peking Man

A Canadian anthropologist,
Davidson Black (1884—
1934), was convinced that
humanity had its origins in
Asia. In 1920 he took up a
post at the Peking Union
Medical College so that

he might investigate the
region for hominid
remains.

In 1927, in a cave at
Cho-K'ou-tien, 25 miles
west of Peking, he located a
single human molar. From
this tooth alone, he de-
duced the existence of a
small-brained hominid,
which he called Sinanthro-
pus pekinensis (Greek for
“Chinese human of Pe-
king") and popularly
known as Peking man.

Later discoveries
showed that Peking man
was very similar to Java
man, which Dubois had dis-
covered (see 1890). Both are
now considered examples

 

of Homo erectus, a species
that preceded Homo sapi-
ens (ourselves and Neander-
thal man), and which in
turn was preceded by the
australopithecines, which
Dart had discovered (see
1924).

Naturally the line of de-
scent was not complete.
Other discoveries remained
to be made.

X Rays and
Mutations

Morgan (see 1907) had been
working with the fruit fly
for two decades, and one of
his students was the Ameri-
can biologist Hermann
Joseph Muller (1890-
1967).

To make the studies on-
truit flies worthwhile, mu-
tations had to occur, and so
they did, but randomly and
not often enough for
Muller. He found, in 1919,
that keeping the fruit flies
at a higher temperature in-
creased the mutation rate,
and he decided that this
might be so because at a
higher temperature, the
molecules in the genes vi-
brated more strongly and
were therefore more likely
to undergo spontaneous
random change.

If this were so, and if
mutations were the result
of molecular change, was
there something that would
bring them about faster
than raising the tempera-
ture would?

It occurred to him to
try X rays. They were more
energetic than gentle heat,
and if they struck a gene
they would certainly affect
some atomic group. He
made use of X rays, and by
1927 it was quite clear that
they worked. The mutation
rate went up sharply.

This was not only use-
ful from the standpoint of
genetics. It became plain
that most X-ray-induced
mutations (and indeed, mu-
tations induced in any fash-
ion) were deleterious. This
meant that X rays and ra-
dioactive radiations had
the capacity to harm
human beings who worked
with them carelessly.
