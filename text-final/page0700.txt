Martian Craters

The Mars probe Mariner 4
had been launched by the
United States on November
28, 1964. On July 14, 1965,
it passed within 6,000 miles
of the Martian surface. As it
did so, it took a series of
twenty photographs, which
were turned into micro-
wave signals, beamed back
to Earth, and there con-
verted into photographs
again.

For the first time in his-
tory, close-up views of the
Martian surface could be
seen by human beings
What those photographs
showed were craters very
much resembling those of
the Moon. There was no
sign of canals.

The photographs did

 

not cover very much of the
Martian surface, but the
general impression was one
of a Moonlike world, not an
Earthlike one. The notion
of artificial canals and an
advanced civilization (see
1877), already shaky be-
cause of increased knowl-
edge concerning the thin,
oxygen-free atmosphere of
Mars, now died a final
death

    

 

Rotation of
Mercury

Schiaparelli had suggested
that Mercury turned one
face to the Sun at all times
(see 1889).

This had begun to seem
doubtful, since if it were
true, the side of Mercury

facing away from the Sun
should be extremely cold.
Microwaves detected from
the dark side of Mercury in
1962 had indicated that it
was considerably warmer
than would be expected if it
were eternally dark.

In 1965 two American
electrical engineers, Rolf
Buchanan Dyce (b. 1929)
and Gordon H. Pettengill,
working with microwave
reflections from the Mercur-
ian surface, were able to
show that it turned on its
axis in about 59 days, de-
spite the fact that it re-
volved about the Sun in 88
days. This meant that every
portion of the planet re-
ceived sunlight at one time
or another.

Eventually, the rota-
tion was found to be 58.65
