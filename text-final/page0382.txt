edge. These were called
solar prominences and, like
solar flares (see 1859), were
evidence of violent activity
on the Sun. This was the
first astronomical discovery
to be made as the result of
photography.

Avogadro’s
Hypothesis

Despite everything, despite
even Kekule's system for
presenting organic struc-
tures (see 1858), there was
still ample confusion over
the structure of many or-
ganic molecules.

For that reason, Kekule
called for an international
conference of chemists to
consider the matter. In
1860 the conference took
place in Karlsruhe, just
across the Rhine from
France. (It was the first in-

ternational scientific con-
ference.)

Attending was an Ital-
ian chemist, Stanislao Can-
nizzaro (1826—1910), who,
two years before, had come
across Avogadro’s hypothe-
sis (see 1811), now half a
century old. Cannizzaro
saw that from Avogadro’s
hypothesis the molecular
weight of various gases
could be determined with
certainty and that this
would reduce much of the
confusion that attended mo-
lecular structure.

He made a strong
speech, introducing the hy-
pothesis and explaining
how to use it. He carried
conviction to some im-
mediately, and to others
afterward. Avogadro’s
hypothesis was accepted at
last, and general agreement
over molecular structure
followed.

Black Bodies

Kirchhoff, having pointed
out that materials emitting
certain wavelengths when
hot will absorb the same
wavelengths when cool (see
1859), drew a natural con-
clusion.

He suggested in 1860
that a body that absorbed
all light and reflected none
(and was a black body as a
result) would, when heated,
emit all wavelengths of
light.

This may not have
seemed very important at
the time, but the question
of how the wavelengths
were given off, how they
were distributed across the
total spectrum, and how
this changed with tempera-
ture turned out to be a |
major puzzle. Within four
decades, it had led to a revo-
lution in physics.
