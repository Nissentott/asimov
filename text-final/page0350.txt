Telegraph

Morse (see 1838) was mak-
ing his telegraph work. In
order to keep the signal
from fading over long
lengths of wire, he made
use of the electric relay in-
vented by Henry (see 1823)
in 1835. This is how it
works. As electricity passes
through a length of wire,
the signal will eventually
weaken but still be strong
enough to produce an elec-
tromagnetic pull and at-
tract a small iron key. This
key, when attracted, can
close a second circuit,
which has a current from a
nearby battery flowing
through it. If that second
circuit is long enough for
its signal to weaken unde-
sirably, a second relay can
start a third circuit going.
In other words, electric sig-
nals of sufficient strength to
send a message can go any
distance provided there are
enough relays.

Morse patented his de-
sign in 1840.In 1843 he
managed to persuade the
United States Congress to
appropriate money, and in
1844 he strung wires from
Baltimore to Washington
and sent the message, in
Morse code, “What hath
God wrought?" (a quota-
tion from the book of Num-
bers in the Bible).

The telegraph spread
quickly, and pretty soon na-
tions were held together by
a webwork of wires that
meant virtually instanta-
neous communication from
border to border.

Companion of

e o
Sirius
Ever since Halley had dis-
covered the proper motion
of stars (see 1718), astrono-
mers had been taking note
of such motions among the
nearer stars. Generally,
those motions followed a

straight line (allowing for
parallax and other effects
not due to the stellar mo-
tion itself).

Bessel (see 1838) noted,
however, that the stars Si-
rius and Procyon had a
somewhat wavy motion
after all else was allowed
for. In 1844 he decided that
this could only be caused
by the gravitational pull of
another star. He suggested,
therefore, that Sirius and
Procyon were each binary
systems. Since the compan-
ion star could in neither
case be seen, Bessel pro-
posed that they were stars
near the end of their lives,
with their light fading to-
ward extinction, and were
now too dim to see, They
were dark companions.

In a way, Bessel was
right, but when the truth
was worked out eighty
years later, it turned out
that the companions were
stranger than Bessel could
possibly have imagined.
