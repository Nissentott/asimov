was a strangeness number
of —2, something no known
particle had.

In 1964 a particle was
found with precisely the
characteristics that Gell-
Mann had predicted, in-
cluding the strangeness
number of —2. This had
much the impact of the
discovery of the missing
elements whose character-
istics Mendeleyev had pre-
dicted (see 1869). From that
moment, the quark theory
had to be taken very seri-
ously indeed.

CPT Symmetry

After Lee and Yang had
shown that parity was not
conserved in the weak inter-
action (see 1956), parity
was combined with a parti-
cle characteristic called
charge conjugation (which
told whether the particle in
question was an ordinary
particle or an antiparticle)
with the idea that if

parity was unbalanced in
one direction in a partic-
ular particle, charge con-
jugation would be
unbalanced in the other,
and the two together would
be conserved.

This was called CP
(charge-parity) conservation.
But in 1964 two American
physicists, Val Logsden
Fitch (b. 1923) and James
Watson Cronin (b. 1931),
found that CP was not al-

ways conserved either. Neu-
tral kaons (see 1952) in
their decay, on rare occa-
sions violated CP conserva-
tion. In order to keep the
symmetry, time (T) had to
be added. Where CP was
asymimetric in one direc-
tion, T was asymmetric in
the other, and the combina-
tion retained symmetry.
Physicists now speak
of CPT symmetry. Cronin
and Fitch shared the
Nobel Prize for physics
in 1980.

Transfer-RNA
Structure

Transfer-RNA molecules,
which act as intermediates
between the nucleotide
chain in messenger RNA
and the amino acid chain
in proteins (see 1956), are
relatively small.

In 1964 the molecule of
alanine-transfer RNA (the
particular transfer RNA
that attaches itself to
the amino acid alanine)
was completely analyzed
by a team headed by
the American biochemist
Robert William Holley
(b. 1922). As Sanger had
worked with insulin (see
1952), so Holley worked
with transfer RNA, break-
ing it down to fragments,
identifying the frag-
ments, and working out
how they fit together. The

alanine-transfer-RNA mole-
cule turned out to be made
up of a chain of seventy-
seven nucleotides.

The chains of this trans-
fer-RNA molecule, and oth-
ers that were analyzed
later, seemed to form three
lobes, rather like a three-
leaf clover. For this work,
Holley received a share of
the Nobel Prize for medi-
cine and physiology in
1968.

Multiperson
Spaceflight

On October 12, 1964, the
Soviet Union launched
Voshkod 1, which carried
three cosmonauts into
orbit. It was the first rocket
to carry more than one
human being.

Rutherfordium

In 1964 both Soviet and
American researchers re-
ported the formation of
atoms of element number
104. There was some
dispute as to priority
and name. The Soviets
named it kurchatovium
after Igor Vasilyevich
Kurchatov (1903-1960),
who had led the team
that developed the Soviet
nuclear bomb. The Amer-
icans named it ruther-
fordiuim after Ernest
Rutherford,
