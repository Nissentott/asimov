Thulium,
Holmium, and
Samarium

If scandium was not quite a
rare earth element, other el-
ements were discovered
that were. Cleve, who iden-
tified scandium as eka-
boron (see above), isolated
two new rare earth ele-
ments in 1879. He gave
both of them names of
Scandinavian aura. One
was thulium, after Thule,
which in classic legend was
the land farthest to the
north, and which was inter-
preted by later Europeans
as representing Scandina-
via. The other he named
holmium, after Stockholm.
In the same year,
Lecoq de Boisbaudran, who

had discovered gallium (see
1874), identified a new rare
earth element, which he
named samarium, because
he had found it in a mineral
called samarskite, which, in
turn, bore the name of an
otherwise obscure Russian
mining engineer named
Samarski.

Heat and
Radiation

An Austrian physicist, Josef
Stefan (1835-1893), was
particularly interested in
how hot bodies cooled and,
therefore, in how much ra-
diation they emitted. He
studied hot bodies over a
considerable range of tem-
perature and, in 1879, was
able to show that the total

radiation of a body was pro-
portional to the fourth
power of its absolute tem-
perature (Stefan's law).

For example, if a
body's temperature tripled,
from 1,000° K to 3,000° K,
its radiation output would
increase 3 X 3 X 3 X 3,0r
81 times. This very rapid in-
crease of radiation with
temperature was more of
an increase than would
have been expected and
turned out to be of great
use in deducing the evolu-
tion of stars. More immedi-
ately, from the total
radiation of the Sun, its sur-
face temperature was de
duced from the rule, and
turned out to be about
5,700° K.
