This was a case of a mo-
lecular disease, since an ab-
normal molecule,
genetically produced, was
the cause. Later a number
of different abnormal hemo-
globin molecules were
found. Hemoglobin A was
the normal molecule, and
hemoglobin S the abnormal
molecule that led to sickle-
cell anemia.

Analysis of the amino
acid content of these two
varieties of hemoglobin
eventually showed that
they differed in a single
amino acid out of a chain
made up of three hundred
or so. It was a remarkable
display of the serious conse-
guences of a tiny abnormal-
ity.

Embryonic
Immunological
Tolerance

Snell had shown the ge-
netic basis of the intoler-
ance for foreign proteins
that made tissue trans-
plantation difficult (see
1948).

It occurred to an En-
glish anatomist, Peter
Brian Medawar (1915—
1987), that embryos might
not yet have developed an
immunological system ca-

 

pable of rejecting foreign
proteins. And in fact, when
he inoculated mice em-
bryos with tissue cells from
another strain, he found
that rejection did not take
place. Furthermore, when
such embryos entered inde-
pendent life and could form
antibodies, they no longer
treated cells from the other
strain as foreign proteins.
By 1949 Medawar had
shown how this technique
might lead to reducing the
difficulties of tissue trans-
plantation. For this he re-
ceived a share of the Nobel
Prize for medicine and
physiology in 1960.

Essential Amino
Acids

Since the first amino acid
had been discovered (see
1806), some twenty amino
acids that oceur commonly
in protein molecules had
been identified. The last of
these was threonine, iso-
lated in 1935 by the Ameri-
can biochemist William
Cumming Rose (1887—
1985).

Rose’s dietary experi-
ments showed that some
amino acids could be manu-
factured in the human body
from other amino acids,

but some could not and had
to be present as such in the
diet. All the amino acids
are essential to the body
structure, but eight of them
are essential in the diet,
where human beings are
concerned, and it is these
eight that are considered
the essential amino acids.
This was definitely es-
tablished by Rose in 1949.

Cometary
Structure

The approach of a comet to
the Sun results in the devel-
opment of a hazy coma and
a tail. The American astron-
omer Fred Lawrence Whip-
ple (b. 1906) suggested in
1949 that this could be ex-
plained by supposing that
comets were essentially icy
in nature, made up of an ad-
mixture of silicate dust and
gravel (and in some cases
perhaps, a small rocky
core). When heated by the
Sun’s closeness, cometary
ice vaporized explosively,
and the dust it contained
formed the haze and the
tail. In short, a comet is a
“dirty snowball.”

This suggestion was {
readily adopted by most as-
tronomers, and few, if any,
doubt it now.
