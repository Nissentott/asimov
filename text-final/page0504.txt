to fight a long war. German
chemists were therefore en-
couraged to find an alter-
nate source for nitrates.

The German chemist
Fritz Haber (1868—1934)
sought a way of fixing atmo-
spheric nitrogen in the labo-
ratory. He found that if he
placed a mixture of nitro-
gen and hydrogen under
high pressure, in the pres-
ence of iron as a catalyst,
he could manufacture am-
monia. From ammonia, it
was easy to obtain nitrates.
By 1908 he had perfected
the method and provided a
source of home-grown (so
to speak) affordable ni-
trates.

This Haber process
made it possible for Ger-
many to fight long wars—
unfortunately.
