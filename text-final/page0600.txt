barded molybdenum with
deuterons, the atomic nuclei
of hydrogen-2, which had
been discovered by Urey
(see 1931, Deuterium). A
deuteron consists of one
proton and one neutromn,
rather loosely bound. If
such a particle approached
a nucleus, the positive
charge of the nucleus
would repel the positively
charged proton, breaking it
from the neutron and de-
flecting it away. The un-
charged neutron,
unaffected, would strike the
nucleus.

It was an American
physicist, Robert Oppenhei-
mer (1904-1967), who had
demonstrated that deu-
teron bombardment was
equivalent to neutron bem-
bardment. Why not use neu-
trons in the first place?
Because the deuteron, car-
rying an electric charge,
could be accelerated in a cy-
clotron and made very ener-
getic. A neutron by itself
could not.

Segre analyzed the
bombarded molybdenum
and did indeed isolate very
small quantities of an ele-
ment that, from its chemi-
cal properties, could be
seen to be number 43. It
was the first element to be
indisputably formed in the
laboratory, rather than dis-
covered in nature, so it was

named technetium, from
the Greek word for “artifi-
cial.”

As it turned out, no
technetium isotope was sta-
ble; all were radioactive. It
is, indeed, the simplest ele-
ment to have no stable iso-
topes. The most nearly
stable isotope, technetium-
97, has a half-life of
2,600,000 years. That is not
a long enough half-life for it
to have endured in the soil
since the formation of the
Earth. It is for that reason
that it was never detected
in the soil, and why Nod-
dack had to be mistaken.

Muon

Anderson, who had discov-
ered the positron as a result
of studying cosmic ray bom-
bardment of atoms within
Earth'’s atmosphere (see
1932), was still investigat-
ing such bombardments. In
the process, he discovered
the track of a particle that,
from its curvature in the
magnetic field, appeared to
be more massive than an
electron but less massive
than a proton.

By 1937 there was no
doubt about it, for the same
phenomenon had been ob-
served by others as well. It
seemed to be the type of
particle that Yukawa had
postulated (see 1935,
Strong Interaction), when

trying to work out what
held protons and neutrons
together in the atomic nu-
cleus.

The new particle was
called a mesotron, from a
Greek word for “intermedi-
ate,” and this was eventu-
ally shortened to meson.
Once it was found that
there were different varie-
ties of these intermediate
particles, different mesons
had to be identified and dif-
ferentiated in some way.
Anderson’s meson was
therefore called a mu-
meson, mu being a Greek
letter equivalent to our m.

It turned out, however,
that the mu-meson was not
the particle Yukawa had
postulated. It showed no
tendency to interact with
nuclei, and Yukawa's parti-
cles would have had to. Its
name was therefore con-
tracted further to muon,
since it was not a meson in
the sense that other inter-
mediate-sized particles
were.

Electrophoresis

Proteins carry electric
charges here and there on
their large molecules, some
positive, some negative. If
an electric field is imposed
on a solution of proteins,
those with a positive
charge outweighing the
negative charge will travel
