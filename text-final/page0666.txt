acid, since there were too
few of the former and too
many of the latter. He
pointed out that it must be
necessary to deal with com-
binations of at least three
nucleotides. If there were
four different nucleotides,
they could be built up into
sixty-four different tri-
nucleotides, or codonsâ€”
more than enough to carry
the information necessary
to build up proteins.

Gamow got the details
wrong in his scheme, but
he had the right idea just
the same. He was the first
to conceive of a multinucle-
otide genetic code.

Photovoltaic
Cells

Eighty years before, it had
been discovered that the el-
ement selenium could con-
duct an electric current
much more easily in the
light than in the dark. It
was eventually realized
that the energy of sunlight
knocked electrons loose
from the selenium atoms,
and it was those electrons
that carried the current.
Selenium came to be
used for small jobs. Thus a
beam of light shone across
a doorway into a selenium
receiver and an electric cur-
rent flowed that kept a door
closed against the pull of a

spring. If an approaching
object interrupted the
beam of light, the darkened
selenium ceased conduct-
ing electricity and the door
swung open. The device,
popularly known as an elec-
tric eye, is more properly
called a photoelectric or pho-
tovoltaic cell.

Selenium is not suit-
able for heavy jobs, as it is
extremely inefficient, turn-
ing less than 1 percent of
the energy of sunlight into
electricity. In 1954, how-
ever, photovoltaic cells
were devised that made use
of semiconductors of the
type used in transistors.

Light kicked electrons out
of place much more effi-
ciently in their case; they
turned about 4 percent of
the sunlight into electricity.
At that level, photovoltaic
cells could also be referred
to as solar batteries.
Photovoltaic cells con-
tinued to be improved, and
eventually some with effi-
ciencies of up to 30 percent
appeared. As efficiency rose
and the cost of manufac-
ture fell, it seemed the time
might come when electric-
ity could be manufactured
directly out of sunlight. If
the Sun were used in that
fashion, we would never
