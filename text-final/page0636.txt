Chloramphenicol at-
tacked many different mi-
croorganisms and was the
first broad-spectrum antibi-
otic to be isolated. It was
fairly toxic, however, and
had to be used carefully.

Holography

Photography had been in
existence for over a century
(see 1839). It worked by
allowing a beam of light to
be reflected from an object
and fall upon a photo-
graphic film. The film re-
corded a two-dimensional
pattern of the reflected
beam, but the information
was limited by the loss of
the third dimension.
Suppose, instead, that
a beam of light were split
in two. One part would
strike an object and be re-
flected with all the irregu-
larities the object would
impose on it. The second
part would be reflected
from a mirror, with no ir-
regularities imposed on it.
The two parts would meet
at the photographic film,
where the interference pat-
tern would be recorded.
The film, when developed,
would then seem to be
blank, but if light were
made to pass through the
film, it would take on the in-
terference characteristics
and produce a three-dimen-
sional image, conveying far

more information than an
ordinary photograph. The
three-dimensional image
would be called a holograph
(where the prefix means
“the whole thing"—that is,
all three dimensions).

This notion was first
worked out in 1947 by a
Hungarian-born British
physicist, Dennis Gabor
(1900-1979), but though
the theory was sound, it
could not be reduced to
practice without further ad-
vances in optics. Once such
advances took place, Gabor
was awarded the Nobel
Prize for physics, in 1971.

Land Camera

In 1947 Land (see 1932) pro-
duced the Land camera,
which produced not nega-
tives but positive prints,
completely developed soon
after the photograph was
taken.

The camera had a dou-
ble roll of film consisting of
ordinary negative film and
a positive paper with
sealed containers of chemi-
cals between. The chemi-
cals were released at the
proper moment and devel-
oped the positive print au-
tomatically.

Supersonic
Flight

Since the invention of the
airplane (see 1903), planes
had been going faster and
faster, but propellers can
only whirl so fast and it
seemed that the speed limit
for planes was bound to be
less than the speed of
sound, which is about 740
miles per hour. Once jet
planes were devised during
World War II (see 1941),
however, the possibility of
planes moving faster than
sound (supersonic flight)
arose.

The difficulty is that, at
their fastest, air molecules
move at the speed of sound.
As long as a plane moves at
a lesser speed, the air mole-
cules ahead will move eas-
ily out of the way. At the
speed of sound or beyond,
the air molecules cannot
move out of the way before
being overtaken. They pile
up ahead of the plane,
which thus flies into com-
pressed air.

This was viewed, dra-
matically, as flying into a
wall, and people began to
speak of a sound barrier. Ac-
tually, there is no such
thing. Bullets and shells
can move faster than
sound, as can the tip of a
bullwhip. As air piles up, it
eventually slips to one side
