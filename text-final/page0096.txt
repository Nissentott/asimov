The Far East

The existence of the Mongol
Empire made it easier for
travelers to make their way
from Europe to China than
ever before. In 1260 two
brothers, Nicolo and Maf-
feo Polo, well-to-do Vene-
tian merchants, made their
first trading trip eastward.
In 1275 they returned to
northern China, where
Kublai Khan maintained
his capital, and this time
they brought Nicolo’s son,
Marco Polo (1254-1324).
Marco stayed in China for
twenty years, was in high
favor most of the time, and
had an opportunity to
study the land, the people,
and the customs. He found
a nation far in advance of
Europe in population, in
wealth, in technology,

and in all the civilized
amenities.

He didn’t return to Ven-
ice till 1295. Then, caught
up in a war between Venice
and Genoa, he was taken
prisoner and, while in

o o

prison, began to dictate his
reminiscences of China.
The book was published in
1298 and was immensely
popular, but it was largely
disbelieved.

It did create an impres-

sion of the “gorgeous East,”

however, so that the Far
East became a wonder-goal
for European dreamers,
with important conse-
quences for the future.

Spinning
Wheels

For thousands of years, fi-
bers had been spun into
thread by the action of the
hand: the fiber was held on
a distaff and was twisted
into yarn by turning a spin-
dle. It was a slow, painstak-
ing process that thoroughly
occupied much of the time
of the females of a house-
hold. (It was “women’s
work" par excellence, and
the females of a family are
still referred to jocularly as
“the distaff side.”)

In India the process
had eventually been mecha-
nized: a foot-powered trea-
dle turned a large wheel
that twisted the spindle.
Such a spinning wheel
greatly hastened the work
of spinning thread out of
fiber. About 1298 the spin-
ning wheel made its way
into Europe.

The wheel and the spin-
dle were connected by a
belt, the first example of a
belt drive in machinery. The
spinning wheel was also
one of the first important
mechanical means of light-
ening women's work.

Longbows

The longbow was invented
in the thirteenth century by
the Welsh. It was more
than 6 feet long and fired
arrows that were 3 feet
long. A skilled longbow ar-
cher could shoot an arrow
accurately for 250 yards
and reach an extreme range
of 350 yards. This was
twice the range of the aver-
