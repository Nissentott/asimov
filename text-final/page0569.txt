Receding
Galaxies

Slipher had measured the
radial velocity of the Andro-
meda nebula even before it
had been found to be an in-
dependent galaxy (see
1923). After that he mea-
sured the radial velocity of
other galaxies and found
that all but two were reced-
ing from us.

The American astrono-
mer Milton La Salle Huma-
son (1891-1972) continued
these labors, working with
Hubble, who had first
proved the Andromeda to
be an independent galaxy.
Humason measured the ra-
dial velocity of many more
galaxies and also found
that all were receding from
us, some at unusually large
rates.

Hubble went over all
the work carefully and used
various methods for esti-
mating the distances of the
various galaxies. By 1929
he felt sufficiently confident
of his conclusions to an-
nounce them. Galaxies, he
maintained, receded from
us at a rate proportional to
their distance from us (Hub-
ble's law).

What is so important
about our Galaxy that all
the others (except for two
of the very closest) should
be receding from us, and
why should those farther
off be receding more
quickly than those nearer?
The explanation that
seemed most logical was
that the Universe was ex-
panding in accordance with
the suggestion of Fried-
mann (see 1917), so that the
galaxies (or clusters of gal-
axies) were all receding
from each other, and not
merely from us. An ob-
server in any galaxy would
see the other galaxies reced-
ing at a rate proportional
to their distance.

With Hubble, then, the
expanding Universe ceased
being a matter of theory
and became an observed
fact.

Solar
Composition

Angstrom had demon-
strated the existence of
hydrogen in the Sun
two-thirds of a century be-
fore (see 1862). It was not
till 1929, however, that the
Solar spectrum was used to

give a fairly detailed pic-
ture of the overall composi-
tion of the Sun.

Russell, who had ear-
lier helped work out the
matter of the Main Se-
quence (see 1914), showed
that the Sun consisted al-
most entirely of hydrogen
and helium, in a 3-to-1
mass ratio. The most im-
portant of the minor com-
ponents were oxygen,
nitrogen, neon, and carbon.
(This turned out to be simi-
lar to the composition of
the Universe as a whole, as
nearly as astronomers can
determine.)

Solar Energy

Three-quarters of a century
before, Helmholtz had sug-
gested that the Sun ob-
tained its energy from
gravitationally induced
shrinkage (see 1853). This
had given an impossibly
small age for the Earth, but
no suitable substitute
source of energy had been
found until the existence of
nuclear energy was demon-
strated by Pierre Curie (see
1901). Then it seemed very
likely that some sort of nu-
clear reaction was the solar
power source.
