if one pours water from a
broad low vessel into a tall
thin vessel, the height of
the liquid increases. This
may be taken to imply that
there is more water, but

Piaget described four
phases of mental growth,
paralleling the physical

growth taking place, and
maintained that all chil-

same phases in the same
order.

 

 

Pluto

Neptune had been dis-
covered by Adams and
Leverrier (see 1846) be-
cause Uranus was not mov-
ing in its orbit exactly as it
should, so that the gravita-
tional field of a more dis-
tant planet was suspected.
Neptune's presence re-
duced but did not entirely
wipe out the discrepancies

in Uranus’s orbit, and some
astronomers thought that a
still more distant but fairly
large planet might exist be-
yond Neptune.

Lowell, who was so en-
thusiastic about Martian
canals (see 1877), was also
enthusiastic about this
“Planet X" and spent much
of his time calculating its
possible orbit and then
searching for it. He died

 

 

without having found it,
but at Lowell Observatory,
which he had founded, the
search went on.

The American astrono-
mer Clyde William Tom-
baugh (b. 1906) continued
the search methodically
His technique was to take
two pictures of the same
small part of the sky on two
different days. Each of
these would show from
