Stellar Diameter

Throughout history, stars
had been studied only as
points of light, and all infor-
mation about them had to
be obtained in ways that re-
quired only points

In 1920, however, Mi-
chelson, who had first used
his interferometer to com-
pare the speed of light in
different directions (see
1881), used it for another
purpose. He built a 20-foot
interferometer and
attached it to the new 100-
inch telescope (see 1917).
With it, he could measure
light emerging from either
side of the star Betelgeuse.
(Betelgeuse is a relatively
near red giant, so that its di-
ameter was likely to prove
more measurable than that
of smaller or more distant
stars.)

The two rays from the
sides of Betelgeuse made a
very tiny angle, but from
the interference fringes
they produced, Michelson

could measure the angle,
and from that angle, know-
ing the distance of Betel-
geuse, he could calculate its
diameter. He worked it out
to be about 260 million
miles, or 300 times the
width of our Sun.

It was news that made
the first page of the New
York Times.

Novas in
Andromeda

The Andromeda nebula was
a matter of dispute among
astronomers in the early de-
cades of the twentieth cen-
tury. There were some who
thought it was a cloud of
dust and gas that was part
of our own Galaxy (and
that the same was true of
other nebulas that resem-
bled it). Others pointed out
that the spectrum of the An-
dromeda and other such
nebulas was that of star-
light and not at all like that
of the Orion nebula, which

was clearly a cloud of dust
and gas. The Andromeda
nebula and others like it
might therefore be vast as-
semblages of stars that
were independent galaxies
but so far away from us
that there was little hope of
seeing their stars individu-
ally.

The leading exponent
of a nearby Andromeda neb-
ula was Shapley, who had
worked out the shape and
size of the Galaxy and deter-
mined the position of the
Solar System within it (see
1918). The leading expo-
nent of a far-off Andromeda
nebula was the American
astronomer Heber Doust
Curtis (1872â€”1942).

Curtis reasoned that,
although the Andromeda
nebula might be too far
away for ordinary stars in
it to be made out, unusu-
ally bright stars such as
novas ought to be visible.
He therefore observed the
nebula carefully and did
see numerous very faint
