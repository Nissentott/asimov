taking it from the veins of
healthy humans or even
from animals. Sometimes it
was helpful, but sometimes
it hastened death, so that
most European nations by
the end of the nineteenth
century had prohibited
such blood transfusion.

In 1900, however, an
Austrian physician, Karl
Landsteiner (1868—1943),
was able to demonstrate
some specific properties of
human blood. Plasma (the
liquid portion of blood)
from one donor might
clump red cells from per-
son A but not from person
B. Serum from another
donor might clump red
cells from person B but not
from person A. Still other
samples of plasma might
clump both—or neither.

Clumped red cells
could block blood vessels
and lead to death. There-
fore, it was necessary in per-
forming a blood transfusion
to know that the blood of
the donor would not clump
the red cells of the receiver.
Landsteiner showed that
human blood fell into four
classes: O, A, B, and AB. It
was always safest if both
donor and receiver were in
the same class. In an emer-
gency, O blood could be
given to any receiver, but A
blood could be given only
to A and AB receivers, B
blood only to B and AB re-

ceivers, and AB blood only
to AB receivers.
Landsteiner made
blood transfusion rational
and safe and added an im-
portant weapon to the med-
ical armory. For this
discovery, he received the
Nobel Prize in medicine
and physiology in 1930.

Yellow Fever

Yellow fever was a terrify-
ing scourge of coastal
cities. New York and Phila-
delphia, for instance, were
periodically hit, and many
deaths followed.

The Spanish-American
War made the United
States particularly disease-
conscious, as far more
American soldiers died
from disease and from
tainted meat than died
from enemy bullets.

The American military
surgeon Walter Reed
(1851-1902) was sent to
Cuba in 1899 to see if he
could do something about
yellow fever, He had al-
ready showed, in 1897, that
it was not caused by a bac-
terium, as had been earlier
proposed.

His studies in Cuba
showed that the disease
was not transmitted by
bodily contact, by clothing,
or by bedding. He sus-
pected mosquito carriers,
as Ross had shown was the
case with malaria (see

1897). The case was proved
for yellow fever, too, in
1900, when doctors allowed
mosquitoes to sting pa-
tients and then themselves.
One doctor, Jesse William
Lazear (1866—1900), died as
a result.

Yellow fever was
brought under control by
fighting mosquitoes and de-
stroying their breeding
grounds. The last yellow
fever epidemic in the
United States was in New
Orleans in 1905.

Dreams

Dreams had always mysti-
fied human beings. Dream-
ing that dead people were
alive helped lead to a belief
in the spirit world. Erotic
dreams led to belief in in-
cubi and succubi. Dreams
seemed to be doorways into
a different world, to be mes-
sages from the gods, to be
revelations of events at a
distance or in the future.

All this was dismissed
as superstition by rational-
ists, but Freud (see 1884)
gave new meaning to
dreams.

In 1900 he published
The Interpretation of
Dreams. Dreams, he main-
tained, might represent
truths about human beings
that they were not willing
to accept in their waking
hours, so that psychoanaly-
sis might be hastened and
