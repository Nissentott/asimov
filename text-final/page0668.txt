Contact Lenses

For some six centuries, peo-
ple who were nearsighted,
farsighted, or astigmatic
had worn spectacles, or eye-

glasses, to correct their vi-
sion (see 1249 and 1825).
Eyeglasses, however, are a
noticeable adjunct that call
attention to a physical

shortcoming. Furthermore,
the myth arose that men
who wore glasses were ef-
feminate and that women
who wore them were ugly.
(The movies, in particular,
helped propagate these mis-
chievous ideas.) For that
reason, it seemed useful to
correct vision in a less con-
spicuous way

As early as 1887, a Ger-
man physician, Adelf
Eugen Fick (1829-1901),
had worked out the notion

of contact lenses, small
lenses that would just fit
over the iris of the eye, cor-
recting vision without any-
one noticing it,

Glass in direct contact
with the eye, however,
would be irritating and
dangerous. In 1954 plastic
contact lenses were pro-
duced, which proved useful
and popular, and contact
lenses are now in common
use.

Exploding
Galaxies

Radio astronomy continued
to show its practitioners
that it could reveal informa-
tion about the Universe not
readily obtainable (if at all)
by ordinary optical obser-
vations.

A radio source in Cyg-
nus was unusually strong,
and optical investigation of
the region revealed a pecu-
liarly shaped galaxy that
looked rather like two gal-
axies undergoing a colli-
sion.

The Soviet astronomer
Viktor Amazaspovich Am-
bartsumian (b. 1908) exam-

 

ined the nature of the radio
source closely and sug-
gested that it was really a
galaxy in a state of vast ex-
plosion. That idea was
borne out by later work.
This was another exam-
ple of what are now known
as active galaxies, in which
events releasing enormous
energies are taking place at
