independently, the lesser

the first to reach the medi-
cal profession, and it was
much more detailed and
careful than those of his
two predecessors, so it is
Colombo who gets credit
for the discovery.

Then came the English

He also knew about the
valves in the veins, since he

(see 1603), who had discoy-
