at Sagres on Cape St. Vin-
cent in 1418. This was in
southernmost Portugal, the
southwestern tip of Europe
Year after year, he outfitted
and sent out ships that
inched their way farther
and farther down the Afri-
can coast. With Prince
Henry, now universally
known as Henry the Navi-
gator, the great European
Age of Exploration began,
and the role that China was

giving up at just about this
time, Portugal (and later
other European powers)
were accepting.

The result was that Chi-
nese vessels never came to
Portugal, but Portuguese
vessels (and those of other
European powers) eventu-
ally came to China, and
China was to pay dearly
for its period of self-satis-
faction

The first fruit of Prince

Henry's efforts came in
1418, when Portuguese nav-
igators discovered Madeira.
It was a heavily wooded is-
land (the name is from the
Portuguese word for
“wood”) and was uninhab-
ited. Prince Henry ordered
the island settled. The
woods were burned down
and the land was given over
to cultivation, that of sugar-
cane in particular.

Azores

The Azores are a group of is-
lands in the Atlantic, of
which the easternmost is
about 750 miles west of
Portugal. They were dis-

covered in 1427 by the
Portuguese navigator Diogo
de Sevilha. Like Madeira,
they were uninhabited, and
like Madeira, they are still
part of Portugal. Since they
are one-third of the way

across the Atlantic in the di-
rection of the American con-
tinents, it is clear that
already, thanks to the com-
pass, the Portuguese were
ranging far.
