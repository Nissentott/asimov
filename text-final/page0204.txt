the number of heartbeats in

a minute. The pulse watch
was the first precision in-

strument that could be
used by physicians.

Coke and Iron

Iron ore had required the
carbon and the high tem-
peratures of burning char-
coal ever since iron-
smelting had begun over
three thousand years before
(see 1000 B.c.). In England,
however, the price of char-
coal was climbing out of
sight as the forests dwin-
dled. Coke had been pro-
duced for half a century or
more but its use in iron-

smelting had not been
worked out.

The British ironworks
master Abraham Darby
(1678-1717) made the first
successful use of coke in
iron-smelting in 1709. In
fact, he found that lumps of
coke were stronger than
lumps of charcoal and
could support a larger
charge of iron ore, so that
iron could actually be pro-
duced at a faster rate. A
larger furnace meant more

draft and a hotter fire so
that iron production was
improved still further.

In short, Great Britain
was now producing the
best and most iron in the
world, and since iron could
be used for building ma-
chinery of all kinds, thanks
to its combination of
strength and cheapness,
Great Britain was set for
what would be called the
Industrial Revolution.
