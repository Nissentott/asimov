Air Brake

Advances in technology in-
variably pose problems in
safety. For instance, a loco-
motive with a number of
carriages following it has a
huge mass and conse-
quently a huge inertia.
Traveling, as it might, at a
high speed, it would take
an enormous force to decel-
erate and bring it to a halt.
Failure to do so could well
make collisions inevitable
and extremely deadly.

In 1868 the American
engineer George Westing-
house (1846—1914) invented
the air brake, which used
compressed air rather than
human muscle. Such an air
brake could be applied si-
multaneously to every
wheel on the train. Corne-
lius Vanderbilt (1794—
1877), the American train
magnate, dismissed the
idea as a “fool notion” be-

cause he did not believe
that one could stop a train
by the use of air. However,
the air brake, after some im-
provements, caught on
quickly and greatly in-
creased rail safety.

Helium

Improvements in transpor-
tation had made it possible
for astronomers to travel
all over the world if they
had to. The most spectacu-
lar astronomical phenome-
non that might be confined
to a small area almost any-
where in the world was a
total eclipse of the Sun.
When an eclipse was due to
be visible at certain areas
in India in 1868, European
astronomers didn't hesitate
to make the journey.

A French astronomer at
the site, Pierre-Jules-César
Janssen (1824—1907), stud-
ied the spectra of the solar

prominences (see 1859).
Meanwhile, a British as-
tronomer, Joseph Norman
Lockyer (1836-1920),
showed that by allowing
light from the edge of the
Sun to pass through a
prism, he could obtain spec-
tra of prominences even
without an eclipse.

Janssen observed a
spectral line that did not
match any of the known
lines in position. He sent a
report on this to Lockyer,
who decided that the line
represented a hitherto un-
known element. The ele-
ment was named helium,
from the Greek word for
“sun.” (Since then, a num-
ber of strange lines have
been found in astronomical
light sources, and other
new elements have been
postulated, but helium—
the first of these—remains
the only one to have proven
truly a new element,
