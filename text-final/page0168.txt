conspicuous crater on the

Moon the name of Tycho,
whom he admired extrava-

was Prolemaeus. Copernicus
is a pretty notable crater,
and Kepler is not bad either.

Lymphatics

Veins and arteries had been
known since Greek times,
but in 1653 a third set of
vessels was discovered. The
Swedish naturalist Olof
Rudbeck (1630-1702) dem-
onstrated their existence in

a dog. These new vessels re-
sembled veins but had thin-
ner walls and carried the
clear watery fluid portion
of the blood (lymph), so that
the vessels were called lym-
phatics.
The lymph is forced
out of the smallest blood

vessels and into the spaces
around the cells, forming
the interstitial fluid. This
drains into the lymphatics
and is carried back into the
blood vessels in various
parts of the body.

Probability

People much given to gam-
bling usually manage to
work out rough-and-ready

ways of measuring the like-
lihood of certain situations
so as to know which way to
bet their money, and how
much, If they did not do

this, they would quickly
lose all their money to
those who did.
