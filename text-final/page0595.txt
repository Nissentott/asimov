cleus). Fermi had made use
of that concept in working
out his theory of the weak
interaction (see 1934).

The Japanese physicist
Hideki Yukawa (1907—
1981) used the ideas of
Heisenberg and Fermi to
build up a theory that
would explain the nucleus.
There had to be a short-
range force like that of the
weak interaction, one that
could be felt only within
the nucleus. This short-
range force would have to
be much stronger than the
weak interaction and in-
deed much stronger than
the electromagnetic inter-
action in order to overcome
proton repulsion. For that
reason, it came to be called
the strong interaction.

Yukawa worked out his
mathematical treatment in
1935. He showed that in
order for the nucleus to
exist, protons and neutrons
had to exchange a particle
possessing mass. The
shorter the range of the
force, the more massive the
particle. He calculated that
the particle exchanged
ought to be about two hun-
dred times as massive as an
electron, or one-ninth as
massive as a proton. Such
intermediate-sized parti-
cles were unknown at the
time, but eventually they
were discovered. Yukawa
was then awarded the

Nobel Prize for physics, in
1949. He was the first Japa-
nese to win a Nobel Prize.

Sulfanilamide

Domagk had found that the
dye Prontosil had certain
antibacterial properties
(see 1932). Prontosil had a
fairly complicated mole-
cule, however, and there
was a reasonable hope that
some smaller fraction of
that molecule might have
the same desirable proper-
ties but be easier to synthe-
size and so more available
in quantity.

In 1935 Domagk man-
aged to break up the mole-
cule of Prontosil into
several fragments, one of
which was sulfanilamide, a
compound already well
known to organic chemists.
Sulfanilamide turned out
to have very pronounced
antibacterial properties.

This heralded the syn-
thesis of a whole family of
similar compounds, collec-
tively called the sulfa drugs,
which were used to combat
infections of various kinds.

Riboflavin

Since the work of Eijkman
on beriberi (see 1896), bio-
chemists had discovered a
number of vitamins that,
like the vitamin B that
cured beriberi, were water-
soluble and contained rings

made up of carbon and ni-
trogen molecules. They
came to be labeled vitamin
B-1 (which cured beriberi),
vitamin B-2, and so on. The
whole was the B-vitamin
complex.

These letter-number
combinations turned out to
be unsatisfactory, however,
because some reported vita-
mins turned out to be false
alarms and others were
simply not given such com-
bination names. The B vita-
mins therefore came to be
known by chemical names.
Thus vitamin B-1 came to
be called thiamin, vitamin
B-2 riboflavin, and so on.

Karrer, who had deter-
mined the structure of vita-
min A (see 1930),
synthesized riboflavin in
1935 and presented the
final proof of its structure.
For this work, he was
awarded a share of the
Nobel Prize for chemistry
in 1937.

Cortisone

The first hormone to be iso-
lated was adrenaline. It
had been obtained by Ta-
kamine (see 1898, Epineph-
rine) from the adrenal
glands. The adrenals con-
sist of two parts, however,
which turned out to be two
different glands. The inner
part, or medulla (the Latin
word for “core”), is what
manufactures adrenaline.
