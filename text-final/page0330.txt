Laws of
Electrolysis

In his youth, Faraday (see
1821) had worked under
Davy (see 1800) and carried
on the elder’s work in elec-
trochemistry. The method
whereby Davy had liber-
ated a number of new met-
als, by passing an electric
current through molten
compounds of those metals,
Faraday named electrolysis
(from Greek words mean-
ing “to loosen by electric-
ity”).

Faraday named a lig-
uid or a solution that could
conduct electricity an elec-
trolyte. The metal rods in-
serted into the liquid or
solution he called electrodes

(from Greek words mean-
ing “the road of electric-
ity"). The positively
charged electrode he called
the anode (high road) and
the negatively charged elec-
trode he called the cathode
(low road). This likened the
flow of electricity to the
flow of water from the
height of the anode to the
depth of the cathode, fol-
lowing Franklin's guess
that electricity flowed from
positive to negative (see
1752). (In fact, that turned
out to be wrong, however,
and electricity flowed from
the negative electrode to
the positive.)

All these names were
suggested to Faraday by
the British scholar William
Whewell (1794-1866), who

also coined the word scien-
tist in the next decade.

In 1832 Faraday an-
nounced what are now
called his laws of electroly-
sis. They are:

1. The mass of sub-
stance liberated at an elec-
trode during electrolysis is
proportional to the quan-
tity of electricity driven
through the solution.

2. The mass liberated
by a given quantity of elec-
tricity is proportional to
the atomic weight of the ele-
ment liberated and in-
versely proportional to the
combining power of the ele-
ment—that is, to the num-
ber of atoms that one atom
of the element will combine
with.
