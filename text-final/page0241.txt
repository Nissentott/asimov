Nile River

The coasts of the continents
were relatively easy to ex-
plore, but the interior repre-
sented greater toil and
greater risks. This was par-
ticularly true of Africa. Its
shores had been the first to
be explored by the Portu-
guese explorers, but its inte-
rior was the last to be
brought into the light of
known geography, so that
for a long time it was
known as the Dark Conti-
nent.

Most paradoxical was
the matter of the Nile
River. On the banks of its
northernmost portion, one
of the two oldest civiliza-
tions of the world flour-
ished, yet neither the
Egyptians nor any of the
civilized people that fol-
lowed them had ever dis-
covered the source of the
Nile. This becomes less sur-
prising when it is under-
stood that the Nile is the
longest river in the world.
It flows in a fairly straight
line from south to north,
and the source is over 4,000
miles from the mouth. The
ancient Egyptians had
made their way upriver for
about 1,500 miles before
giving up the search.

In 1770, however, the
Scottish explorer James
Bruce (1730-1794) made
his way upstream to Khar-
toum in the Sudan. There
two rivers join, the White
Nile coming up from the
southwest and the Blue
Nile from the southeast.
Bruce followed the Blue
Nile and finally found its
source in Lake Tana in
what is now northwestern
Ethiopia.

This seemed at the
time to solve the problem
of the source of the Nile,
but the White Nile, being
the longer of the two, is the
main river, and its source
remained unknown for an-
other century.

Gulf Stream

There are currents in the
water that are as important
to navigation as the winds
are, though they are less no-
ticeable.

Franklin (see 1733) had
traveled from America to
Europe several times and
his ever-inquiring niind be-
came aware of the differ-
ence in speed in the two
directions. He was the first
to study shipsâ€™ reports seri-
ously and to query the expe-
rience of whalers. As a

result he found that there
was a current of warm
water coming up from the
Gulf of Mexico (the Gulf
Stream) and then crossing
the North Atlantic toward
Europe. It sped the ships
sailing eastward to Europe
and slowed those sailing
westward to North
America. Franklin mapped
it and in this way showed
British navigators the
routes to avoid if they
wished to make good time
westward. This was the be-
ginning of the scientific
study of ocean currents.

Water currents did not
concern only navigators.
Labrador and Great Britain
are at precisely the same
latitude on opposite sides
of the North Atlantic
Ocean. However, the Gulf
Stream, a warm-water cur-
rent, bathes the British
coasts, while a cold-water
current from the Arctic
bathes the Labrador coast.
For that reason, Great Brit-
ain has a mild climate and
is populated by tens of mil-
lions, while Labrador is
frigid and is populated by
tens of thousands.
