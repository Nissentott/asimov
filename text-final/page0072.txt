He is best known for
problems that had to be
solved with whole num-
bers, and such problems in-

volve what are still called
Diophantine equations. He
also showed that fractions
could be treated as num-

bers, thus reducing much of
the discomfort they usually
caused.

Alchemy

Creating chemical change
has been part of human life
from the start. Cooking in-
volved chemical changes
and so did fermentation.
The production of pottery
out of clay, metals out of
ore, charcoal out of wood,
and glass out of sand all in-
volved chemical changes.

It was not until the
years after Alexander the
Great (see 320 B.c.), how-
ever, that scholars began to
study chemical change sys-
tematically. This may have
been the result of a fusion
of Greek and Egyptian
thinking, and it flourished
first in Ptolemaic Egypt.

As Euclid, in Egypt,
summarized ancient geom-
etry, and Ptolemy, again in
Egypt, summarized ancient
astronomy, so Zosimus
(240-?), also in Egypt,

about the year 300, summa-
rized ancient alchemy.

The early work in al-
chemy was highly mystical
and not very useful and was
sidetracked eventually ina
vain effort to find some way
of changing "‘base metals,"”
such as lead or iron, to
gold. Nevertheless, inquir-
ing minds, even when mis-
led, could not help making
some discoveries in the
long run, and this the alche-
mists did.

Stirrups

The Greeks and Romans re-
lied on infantry. Stolid,
well-trained foot soldiers,
whether organized into a
phalanx or a legion, could
withstand horsemen, so
that the cavalry was re-
duced to auxiliary impor-
tance in Greek and Roman
times. Cavalry could charge

in an attempt to panic the
enemy, and could chase the
enemy once a panic had set
it, and could fight each
other, but cavalry rarely de-
cided a battle.

The horse and chariot
had faded in importance as
a larger horse was bred ca-
pable of running with the
full weight of an armed sol-
dier on its back. Saddles
made it easier to sit on a
horse’s bony spine, but
riding was still precarious,
and thrusting with a spear
was dangerous, for if the
thrust was parried the rider
might easily be pushed off
the horse. It was safer to
shoot arrows from a dis-
tance.

In India, about 100 B.C.,
the notion arose of having a
leather loop suspended
from the saddle, into which
the big toes could be thrust
in order to steady the rider.
