Telegraph
Plateau

With cables laid across the
Hudson and Mississippi riv-
ers in the 1840s and under
the English Channel and
the Irish Sea in the 1850s
(see 1851), it became natu-
ral to think of a real job,
that of laying a cable under
the Atlantic Ocean to con-
nect Europe and America.
The process of laying
such a cable required some
understanding of what the
floor of the Atlantic Ocean
was like, and the task fell to
the American oceanogra-
pher Matthew Fontaine
Maury (1806—1873). In the
early 1850s he had pre-
pared a chart of ocean
depths, and by 1854 he had
noted that the Atlantic
Ocean was shallower in the
center than on either side.
He concluded that there was
a central plateau, which he
called Telegraph Plateau.

This was the first im-
portant physical finding
concern

tom, and little more was to
be learned for another cen-
tury

Non-Euclidean
Geometry

The non-Euclidean geome-
try worked out by Loba-
chevsky and Bolyai (see
1826) presupposed the pos-
sibility of more than one
line through a point (even
an infinite number of lines),
all parallel to a given line
that did not include the
point. As in Euclidean ge-
ometry, lines of infinite
length were possible.

In 1854 a German
mathematician, Georg
Friedrich Bernhard Rie-
mann (1826-1866), devel-
oped another kind of non-
Euclidean geometry, one in
which it was impossible for

 

  

any two lines to be parallel,
and all lines intersec
What's more, in th
try all lines were finite in
length. In Euclidean geome-
try, the three angles of a tri-
le add up to 360
degrees; in Lobachevskian

geometry, they add up to

sounded like pure abstrac-
