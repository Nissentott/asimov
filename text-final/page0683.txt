guard I had made thou-
sands of revolutions, it was
clear that the perigee was
slightly more affected by
the bulge south of the equa-
tor than by the bulge north
of it. This meant that the
Earth was a little bulgier
(to the extent of about 25
feet) south of the equator
than north.

The shape of the Earth
was, in this way, more accu-
rately determined than
would have been possible
by any reasonable Earth-
bound observations. This
was an indication of the
way we could learn more
about the Earth itself by
going out into space.

Solar Wind

It had been recognized for
some time that solar flares
(see 1859) were highly
energetic phenomena on
the surface of the Sun.
Occasionally, when a solar
flare appeared on the solar
surface, it was followed,
after the lapse of some
days, by a magnetic storm
on Earth. Something was
apparently emitted by the
flares that eventually
reached Earth.

The American physicist
Eugene Newman Parker (b.
1927) had argued the year
before that the Sun con-
stantly emitted charged
particles in every direction

and that these drifted out-
ward through the Solar Sys-
tem, passing Earth. He
called them the solar wind.

A solar flare might
therefore be the source of
an unusually large gust of
such particles, which on ar-
riving at Earth would inten-
sify the usual effects of the
solar wind.

The existence of the
solar wind was verified by
Lunik IT and Lunik III on
their way toward the Moon
in 1959, and later probes
did the same.

Shape of the
Hemoglobin
Molecule

Six years earlier, Sanger
had determined the exact
order of the amino acids in
a long protein chain (see
1952, Insulin Structure),
but even that was not suffi-
cient to describe the struc-
ture of a protein totally.
The amino acid chain bent
and curved and was hooked
together by a variety of
chemical bonds.
Generally, an enzyme
molecule did not work as a
simple amino acid chain. It
was the intricate three-di-
mensional folding of the
amino acid chain that
brought certain amino
acids together and pre-
sented a surface on which

chemical reactions could
take place with great ease
â€”though they could take
place only with the greatest
difficulty otherwise.

The Austrian-born Brit-
ish biochemist Max Ferdi-
nand Perutz (b. 1914)
undertook to work out the
three-dimensional struc-
ture of hemoglobin. The log-
ical way to do this was by
the study of X-ray diffrac-
tion patterns, but the pat-
terns obtained, while
sufficient to be useful in
working out the structure
of small molecules such as
vitamin B-12 or simple
chains such as the DNA
double helix (see 1953),
were not helpful in working
out the intricacies of the
protein molecule.

Perutz found, however,
that if he added a single
atom of a heavy metal like
gold or mercury to each
molecule of protein, these
atoms would strongly dif-
fract X rays. The resultant
pattern was sufficiently pro-
nounced to give better
hints to molecular struc-
ture.

By 1959 he had worked
out the three-dimensional
position of every atom in
the hemoglobin molecule.
His student, the British bio-
chemist John Cowdery Ken-
drew (b. 1917), did the
same for the similar but
somewhat simpler mole-
