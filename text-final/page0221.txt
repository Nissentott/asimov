Transcendental
Numbers

One would think that math-
ematicians had dealt with
all the different kinds of
numbers there were—inte-
gers, fractions, negative
numbers, irrational num-
bers, imaginary numbers,
what else could there be?
In 1744 Leonhard

Euler (see 1736) pointed
out that polynomial alge-
braic equations, consisting
of powers of x, can have all
sorts of solutions—whole
numbers, fractions, irratio-
nals, negatives, imaginar-
ies, complex numbers, and
so on. These are all alge-
braic numbers.
Nevertheless, Euler
pointed out, there are other
numbers that can never be

a solution for any algebraic
equation that can possibly
be written. Such numbers
are transcendental numbers,
from Latin words meaning
“to climb beyond,” because
they climb beyond the
equations, so to speak. We
now know that there are an
infinite number of transcen-
dental numbers.

 

1745

 

Leyden Jar

Hauksbee's glass sphere
(see 1706), first produced
forty years earlier, was sur-
passed as an electricity-
storing device by the work
of a Dutch physicist, Pieter
van Musschenbroek (1692—
1761).

In 1745 he placed
water in a metal container
suspended by insulating

silk cords, and led a brass
wire through a cork into
the water. He built up an
electric charge in the water
but did not realize how
much had accumulated in
the device until an assis-
tant happened to pick it up
and touch the brass wire
outside the cork. The con-
tainer promptly discharged
all of the electric charge it
had accumulated and gave

 

the poor assistant a fearful
shock. It was the first good-
sized artifical electric shock
anyone had ever received.
(The lightning stroke is
worse, of course, but it is a
natural electric shock.)

A German physicist,
Ewald Georg von Kleist
(1700—-1748), independently
produced the same device
at about the same time. He
discovered the strength of
