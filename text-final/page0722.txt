Mapping of
Mercury

Mariner 10 had been
launched on November 3,
1973. On February 5, 1974,
it passed by Venus just
3,600 miles above its cloud
layer and then headed for
Mercury. On March 19,
1974, it passed within 435
miles of Mercury’s surface.
It moved into an orbit
about the Sun in such a
way that it passed ne
Mercury a second and third

 

 

  

million trillion times the
lifetime of our present uni-
verse to date. Still, given
enough protons, a few
might be found to decay in
any given reasonably short

time. On the third ap-
proach, it passed within
200 miles of Mercury’s sur-
face.

Muariner 10 confirmed
Mercury's rotation rate and
temperature and showed
that it had no satellite and
no significant atmosphere

It determined the diameter,

mass, and density of M
cury with greater precision
than had been possible be-
fore. In addition, it allowed
about three-eighths of Mer-
cury’s surface to be
mapped.

 

 

 

period of time. Such proton
decays have been searched

for but have not yet been de-

tected

The photographs it
took of Mercury showed a
landscape that looked very
much like that of the Moon.
There were craters every-
where, the largest being
125 miles in diameter. Mer-
cury is not as rich in “seas”
as the Moon is. The largest
one sighted is about 870
miles across and is called
Caloris (heat). Mercury also
has cliffs that are a couple
of hundred miles long and
about 1! miles high.

In addition Mariner 10
discovered that Mercury
