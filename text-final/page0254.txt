half-century earlier (see
1728).

It struck Herschel (see
above) that he might be
able to detect parallax if he
studied stars that were very
close together in appear-
ance. Both would be in the
same line of sight, but if
one was considerably
brighter than the other, it
might be considerably
closer. In that case, the
brighter star should show
slight parallactic changes
of position in the course of
the year relative to the dim
star.

Herschel began the
study of such stars in 1781,
and as time went on, he did
notice that one of the stars
changed position relative to
the other in a number of
cases. In no case, however,
was this change quite what
one would expect if it had
resulted from the motion of
the Earth. In time, astrono-
mers were forced to the con-
clusion that some double
stars were actually close to
each other in reality and
not merely in appearance
and that they moved about
each other. Herschel had
discovered binary stars, from
a Latin word referring to
objects that exist in pairs.

Newton had presented
his law of universal gravita-
tion, assuming that it was a
force of attraction between
any two objects in the Uni-

verse, but it had actually
been tested only on objects
within the Solar System.
Now for the first time it
could be tested on distant
stars, where it was eventu-
ally proved to be truly uni-
versal.

Crystallography

Crystal is from a Greek
word for “ice” or “frozen.”
Since ice is sometimes
transparent, the word crys-
tal came to be used for any
transparent object. Thus, a
fortune-teller uses a “crys-
tal ball” that is a ball of or-
dinary glass. The planets
were thought to be set in
“crystalline spheres” be-
cause those spheres were
transparent.

When quartz was
found, it had the properties
of rocky material, but it
was transparent. Since bits
of quartz often had straight
edges, planar faces, and
sharp angles, people began
to speak of any solids with
straight edges, planar faces,
and sharp angles as crys-
tals, even when they were
not transparent.

In 1781, a French min-
eralogist, René-Just Hatiy
(1743-1822), was handling
a piece of calcite crystal
that had a rhombohedral
shape (a kind of slanted
cube). Accidentally, he
dropped it and it shattered.
Haiiy noticed that the

pieces all had a rhombohe-
dral shape. He broke more
pieces of calcite and found
that, no matter what the
original shape was, it broke
into rhombohedrals.

Haty suggested that
each crystal was built of
successive additions of
what we now call a unit
cell, which formed, in the
absence of external interfer-
ence, a simple geometrical
shape with constant angles.
He felt that an identity or
difference in crystalline
form implied an identity or
difference in chemical com-
position.

In this way, Hatiy
founded the modern sci-
ence of crystallography.

Axial Inclination
of Mars

The Earth’s axis is tipped
23.5 degrees to the perpen-
dicular of the plane of its
orbit. It is this which gives
Earth its seasons. When the
Earth is in that region of its
orbit in which its North
Pole is tipped toward the
Sun, the northern hemi-
sphere has its summer and
the southern its winter.
When the Earth is in the op-
posite region of its orbit,
with the North Pole tipped
away from the Sun, the
northern hemisphere has
its winter and the southern
its summer.
