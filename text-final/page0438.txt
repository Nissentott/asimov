guanine, and three different
pyrimidines, uracil, cyto-
sine, and thymine. He also
decided that a sugar
molecule was present

but couldn't tell which
one.

Much remained to be
done, but it was a good
start and far more im-
portant than anyone could
tell at the time. This was
some of the work for which
Kossel received a Nobel
Prize in physiology and
medicine in 1910.

Praseodymium
and
Neodymium

Didymium was a rare earth
element that had been dis-
covered by Mosander some
forty years before. Its name
is derived from the Greek
word for “twin" because it
was so like other rare earth
elements. However, the
name turned out to be
more apt than was thought,
for the element was actu-
ally twins, a mixture of
two very similar

elements.

In 1885, after much
careful work, an Austrian
chemist, Carl Auer,
Freiherr von Welsbach
(1858-1929), managed to
separate the two elements.
One he named praseodym-
ium (“green twin,” because
of the color of a prominent

 

line in its spectrum) and
the other he named
neodymium (new twin).

Welsbach
Mantle

Von Welsbach (see above)
was the first to find an im-
portant use for the rare
earth elements in which he
was so interested.

It occurred to him that
gas flames might be made
to give more light if they
were allowed to heat up
some compound that would
itself then glow brightly.

He tried many sub-
stances that would glow at
high heat without melting
and finally found that if he
impregnated a cylindrical
fabric with thorium nitrate,
to which a small amount of
cerium nitrate (a com-
pound of one of the rare
earth elements) had been
added, he would obtain a
brilliant white glow in a
gas flame.

This Welsbach mantle,
when used in a kerosene
lamp, gave such a bright
light that it allowed kero-
sene lamps to compete with
electric light for another
thirty years or so.

Transformer

In the battle between alter-
nating current and direct
current (see 1883), victory
went to alternating current,

because it could be trans-
formed into another cur-
rent of much higher voltage
and of correspondingly
lower amperage (to get
something, you have to give
up something in the real
world). While it is in this
high-voltage state, the cur-
rent can be transported
long distances with com-
paratively little loss. Once
it arrives at its destination,
it can be reconverted into a
low-voltage, high-amperage
current again, in which
form it can do its work best.

For these transforma-
tions from low to high volt-
age and back again, a
device was needed that was
invented in 1885 by an
American electrical engi-
neer, William Stanley
(1858-1916), who was
working for Westinghouse
(see 1868). His transformer
could shift voltage and am-
perage, but only with alter-
nating current and not with
direct current.

Automobile

Until the invention of the
steam engine (see 1712), the
dream of a carriage that
would move without a
horse pulling it (a
“horseless carriage™) had
belonged to the world of
myths and legends. The
steam-engine is supposed
to have been put into ac-
tion as early as 1769, but
such steam-powered vehi-
