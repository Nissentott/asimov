1870

Troy

The ancient non-Biblical
site of most interest to Eu-
ropeans was surely Troy, in
what is now the northwest-
ern part of Asian Turkey. It
was there that the semileg-
endary Trojan War was
fought about 1200 B.c., and
many who had read
Homer's Iliad in the last
twenty-five centuries had
thought there was a histori-
cal basis to it.

One of the believers
was a German busine:
man, Heinrich Schliemann

1890). Born poor, he
d hard to make a for

tune, for the sole purpose of

using it to locate the ruined
i Troy.
In 1870 he went to Tur-
7, managed to choose the
right spot (following the de-
scription in the Iliad), and
uncovered a series of an-
built one on top
of the other. He obtained

 

 

various fascinating arti-
facts, many of them made
of gold.

Although Schliemann
was not the first archaeolo-
ist, and was a very unsci-
entific one, ruining a great

deal more than he found,
his findings w n

tional and rang through the
world. His work was a
great stimulant to archaec
logical research in general.
