lighter energy source, but
even so it was difficult to
force a balloon through the
air against air resistance.

It occurred to a Ger-
man inventor, Ferdinand
Adolf August Heinrich von
Zeppelin (1838-1917), to
streamline a balloon so
that it would meet with less
air resistance. This could
be done by confining it
within a cigar-shaped
metal envelope. The Hall-
Heroult method had made
aluminum cheap (see 1886),
and aluminum had the
combination of lightness
and strength needed to

 

make such a streamlined
balloon feasible.

On July 2, 1900, one of
Zeppelin's cigar-shaped
vessels rose into the air. Be-
neath it was a gondola bear-
ing an internal-combustion
engine and a propeller. For
the first time, an aircraft
was not at the merey of the
wind but could move in
any direction at will. It was
called a dirigible balloon;
that is, “a balloon that
could be directed.” This
was soon abbreviated to di-
rigible, and the device was
also sometimes called a zep-
pelin after its inventor.

Knossos

During classical times,
Crete had lain outside the
current of history and was
little regarded. Yet Homer,
describing the Trojan War,
gave Crete an important
role, and in the Greek
myths, Crete, under its king
Minos, was described as do-
minating Greece in early
times.

A British archaeologist,
Arthur John Evans (1851—
1941), felt there might be
some historical fact in that
myth and, beginning in
1894, he engaged in archae-
ological excavations in
Greece. By 1900 he had dug
up the site of Knossos, the
capital of Crete in Minos’s
legendary time. (Evans
called it the Minoan civili-
zation after the king.) He
showed that a complex and
advanced civilization had
indeed existed for nearly
two thousand years before
the Trojan War, and that it
had indeed dominated the
islands of the Aegean and
parts of the Greek main-
land for a long period.
