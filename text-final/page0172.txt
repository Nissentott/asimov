Capillaries

Harvey's discovery of the
circulation of the blood (see
1628) had an important
flaw. According to Harvey,
the blood traveled from the
heart through the arteries,
into the veins, and back to
the heart. But how did the
blood get from the arteries
to the veins? There was no
visible connection, and Har-
vey was forced to maintain
that the connection con-
sisted of blood vessels that
were too small to see.

The microscope was
now an important tool,
however, and a pioneer in
this field was the Italian
physiologist Marcello Mal-
pighi (1628—-1694). The thin
wing-membranes of the bat
contained what was virtu-
ally a two-dimensional net-
work of blood vessels.
Malpighi studied it under
the microscope in 1660 and
saw the tiniest arteries and

veins connected by vessels
too small to see without the
microscope. He called the
tiny vessels capillaries, from
a Latin word meaning
""hair-like.” Harvey's theory
was complete, but Harvey
hadn’t lived to see it. He
had died three years before.

Static Electricity

When Thales (see 585 B.c.)
studied the magnetic prop-
erties of loadstone, he is
also supposed to have stud-
ied amber, which, when
rubbed, attracts light ob-
jects. Whereas magnets at-
tract only iron, rubbed
amber attracts many
things.

William Gilbert, who
showed that Earth was a
magnet (see 1600), found
that rock crystal and a vari-
ety of gems showed the
same attractive force when
rubbed that amber did.

Since the Greek word for

amber was elektron, Gilbert
called these substances elec-
trics, and the phenomenon
came to be called electricity.
Because the electricity in
electrics seemed to stay put
if left undisturbed, it was
referred to eventually as
static electricity, from a
Greek word meaning “to
stand.”

The first to demon-
strate static electricity on a
large scale was Guericke,
who had invented the air
pump (see 1645). The elec-
trical phenomenon was pro-
duced by rubbing, and
Guericke in 1660 fashioned
a globe of sulfur that could
be rotated on a crank-
turned shaft. When it was
stroked with the hand as it
rotated, it accumulated
quite a lot of static electric-
ity. It could be discharged
and recharged indefinitely,
and Guericke could pro-
duce sparks from his electri-
fied globe.
