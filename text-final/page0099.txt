Canary Islands

The Canary Islands are off
the shore of Morocco,

which is in northwestern
Africa. The King of Maurita-
nia (located where Morocco
is now) had sent an expedi-
tion there in 40 B.c. and

sciousness. However, in
1312, a Genoese vessel
reached the Canary Islands,

and though they didnâ€™t stay
either, this visit was known
to Europe and remem-

and abortive step toward
European expansion over-

Dissection

The stirrings of humanism
allowed scholars to grow
more interested in science.
In the medical schools of
Italy, it even became possi-
ble to dissect cadavers once
again. The greatest of the

new group of anatomists
was the Italian Mondino de
Luzzi (ca. 1275-1326), who
taught at the medical
school of Bologna

In 1316 he published
the first book in history to

 

be devoted entirely to anat
omy

 

He remained under

the influence of the Greek
and Arabic writers and

clung to them sometimes in
