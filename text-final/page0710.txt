ture of insulin (see 1952). In
1969 the American bio-
chemist Gerald Maurice
Edelman (b. 1929) worked
out the structure of a
gamma globulin, a type of
protein that exists in the
blood and out of which vari-
ous antibodies are formed.
(Antibodies react with par-
ticular foreign proteins, so
that they are essential to
the body's immune mecha-
nism.) For this, Edelman re-
ceived a share of the Nobel
Prize for physiology and
medicine in 1972.

Also in 1969, D. C.
Hodgkin (see 1955) com-
pleted our knowledge of the
insulin molecule by work-
ing out its three-dimen-
sional structure.

And still in 1969, the
Chinese-born American bio-
chemist Choh Hao Li (see
1943) synthesized the en-
zyme ribonuclease, putting
every one of its 124 amino
acids into a chain in the
right order. Ribonuclease,
which catalyzes ribonucleic
acid’s breakdown into
smaller fragments, was the
first enzyme to be synthe-
sized.

Artificial Hearts

In comparison with most
living organs, the heart is
simple. It is primarily a
pump designed to push the
blood through the vessels of

the circulatory system. It is
not difficult to imagine that
an artificial pump the size
of the heart and similar in
structure but powered from
without might do the job.
The first attempt to
place such an artificial
heart inside a human being
was made in 1969. The
American surgeon Denton
Cooley implanted a plastic
heart designed by the Ar-
gentine-born American Do-
mongo Liotta. The patient
lived for nearly three days
with the artificial heart be-
fore it was replaced with a
transplanted natural heart.

Coronary
Bypass

The heart receives blood
from the coronary arteries,
which branch off from the
aorta near the point where
the aorta leaves the heart.
In other words, the very
first share of the blood, as it
emerges from the heart on
its way to the body gener-
ally, is fed to the heart it-
self. There seems justice
here, since the heart’s labor
on behalf of the body is
both enormous and essen-
tial.

Unfortunately, the cor-
onary arteries have a ten-
dency to accumulate rough
plaques on their inner sur-
face, plaques that are rich

 

in cholesterol. (This is par-
ticularly true when people
eat too much of a cholester-
ol-rich diet.) These plaques
narrow the bore of the ar-
teries and allow less blood
to reach the heart. The
roughness also increases
the likelihood of clot forma-
tion, which may stop the
blood flow altogether.

Starving the heart of
blood causes the severe
pains of angina pectoris,
and of course any serious
stoppage causes a heart at-
tack and death. A perfectly
healthy heart can be immo-
bilized because of such cor-
onary mishaps.

In 1969 a surgical tech-
nique was developed of
using veins or sometimes
arteries from the patient’s
own body to lead the blood
around the clogged por-
tions of the coronaries, re-
newing the heart’s blood
supply. If more than one
such portion is bypassed,
we speak of a double by-
pass, a triple bypass, and
S0 on.

Since 1969 coronary by-
pass operations have be-
come extremely common,
and while they do not neces-
sarily lengthen life, they
make what remains of it
much more pain-free and
also make it possible to in-
dulge in exertion freely
again. This is a great boon
to many.
