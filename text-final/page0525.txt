The first thought was
that the Main Sequence rep-
resented the line of evolu-
tion of stars; that they
started as large, cool con-
glomerations of gas (red
giants) that condensed and
grew hotter till they
reached the top of the Main
Sequence as the hottest
stars there were. They then
gradually cooled and grew
dimmer, ending as red
dwarfs, finally becoming
too cool to glow altogether.

This view turned out to
be incorrect, but Russell’s
diagram, based on observa-
tion, was correct. It merely
had to be interpreted in bet-
ter fashion. Giving Hertz-
sprung credit for priority,
it is usually called the
Hertzsprung-Russell dia-
gram, or the H-R diagram
for short.

White Dwarfs

A star that didn't fit into
the Main Sequence (see
above) was the dim com-
panion of Sirius, which had
first been postulated by Bes-
sel (see 1844) and first ob-
served by Clark just over
half a century before (see
1862).

From the strength of
the companion'’s attraction
to Sirius, the companion
had to be about the mass of
the Sun. At the distance of
Sirius, a star with the mass

of the Sun that was as dim
as the companion was
should be very cool indeed
and therefore red in

color. Yet the companion
didn't seem to be red, but
white.

The American astrono-
mer Walter Sydney Adams
(1876—1956) managed to
get its spectrum in 1914, de-
spite the blaze of nearby
Sirius. The companion
turned out to be a hot star,
as hot as Sirius and hotter
than our Sun. To be our
Sun's mass and to be hotter
than the Sun, too, the com-
panion should have been
blazing out as a first-magni-
tude star, but it wasn’t. In
fact it is too dim to see with-
out a telescope. The only
way of explaining that was
to suppose that Sirius's
companion was a very
small star, more nearly the
size of the Earth than of the
Sun—even though it had
the mass of the Sun.

Had the discovery been
made a few years earlier, it
would have been dismissed
as preposterous. However,
now that science had ac-
cepted Rutherford's nu-
clear atom (see 1911), it
seemed possible that under
some conditions atoms
might break down and the
nuclei approach each other
more closely than in ordi-
nary matter. In the case of
broken-atom degenerate

matter, densities might eas-
ily be a million times that
of ordinary matter.

Sirius’s companion
(now more commonly
known as Sirius B, while
Sirius itself is sometimes
called Sirius A), being both
tiny and white-hot, was
called a white dwarf. It was
the first of this class to be
discovered, but white
dwarfs were eventually
found to be quite common,
though only those rela-
tively close to us can be
seen because of their low
total luminosity.

Jupiter IX

The tale of Jupiter's satel-
lites did not end with the
discovery of Jupiter VI and
Jupiter VII (see 1904).

In 1908 the French as-
tronomer Philibert Jacques
Melotte discovered Jupiter
VIII, which was still farther
from Jupiter than VI and
VII were. Jupiter VIII cir-
cled Jupiter at an average
distance of 14,600,000
miles.

Then in 1914 the Ameri-
can astronomer Seth
Barnes Nicholson (1891—
1963) discovered Jupiter
IX. Its average distance
from Jupiter is 14,700,000
miles and it circles Jupiter
in two years and one
month. No other known sat-
ellite anywhere in the Solar
