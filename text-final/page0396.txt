Dry Cell

Batteries in use up to this
time, including storage bat-
teries, were made up of lig-
uids inside a container.
They had to be, since the
chemical reactions re-
quired to produce an elec-
tric current proceeded in
solution. Batteries con-
taining fluid had to be han-
dled with care. They could
be easily tipped and
spilled, and the fluid was
usually corrosive.

In 1867, however, a
French engineer, Georges
Leclanché (1839-1882), de-
vised a cell and, experi-
menting over the course of
twenty years, gradually

converted its fluid into a
stiff paste by adding flour
and plaster of Paris.

In the end, while such
a cell was not really dry, it
was not so wet that it
would spill. It could be
thrown about, placed on its
side, and turned upside
down without being ad-
versely affected. It came to
be called a dry cell. It was
these dry cells that came to
be used in myriads of small
devices from flashlights to
children’s toys.

Typewriters

Although printing had
come into use four centu-
ries before, letters or stories

still had to be written by
hand. (The text of a piece of
writing before it is pub-
lished is still called a manu-
script, from Latin words
meaning “handwritten.”)
Attempts had been made to
devise machines that could
print letters when certain
levers were struck, but they
usually proved extremely
cumbersome and worked
much more slowly than a
person could write.

The first writing ma-
chine that was reasonably
compact and, with prac-
tice, could be made to print
at least as quickly as people
could write was built by an
American inventor, Christo-
pher Latham Sholes (1819—
