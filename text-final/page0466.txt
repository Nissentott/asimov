sulfate (see 1896) was a
Polish-born French chemist,
Marie Sklodowska Curie
(1867—1934). She was the
wife of Pierre Curie (see
1880).

In 1897 she made use
of her husband’s discovery
of piezoelectricity to mea-
sure the intensity of radia-
tion given off by a variety
of uranium compounds.
She showed that the inten-
sity was always in propor-
tion to the quantity of
uranium present.

This demonstrated that
the radiation did not come
from the compound as a
whole, but from the ura-
nium atom specifically. It
was an atomic phenome-
non and not a molecular
one.

Alpha Rays and
Beta Rays

The radiations given off by
uranium were of more than
one kind. Some were de-
flected only slightly in a di-
rection that indicated them
to be positively charged.
Some were deflected much
more sharply in the oppo-
site direction and were
therefore negatively
charged. Both had to con-
sist of streams of particles,
and the particles of the for-
mer were clearly the more
massive.

The British physicist

 

Ernest Rutherford (1871—
1937) noted this in 1897. He
called the massive, posi-
tively charged radiation
alpha rays, and the lighter,
negatively charged radia-
tion beta rays, after the first
two letters of the Greek
alphabet. Those names
have remained in use ever
since.

Nickel as
Catalyst

The metal nickel combines
with carbon monoxide to
form a compound that is
liquid at ordinary tempera-
tures and boils at 43°C. In
1897 the French chemist
Paul Sabatier (1854-1941)
wondered if other volatile
nickel compounds could be
formed by combining the
metal with other gases. He
chose ethylene for his at-
tempt, since like carbon
monoxide, it has a double
bond.

He failed, but found
that some of the ethylene
had, in the presence of
nickel, changed to ethane.
The double bond in ethyl-
ene had thus added two hy-
drogen atoms. That
happens easily if a metal
such as powdered platinum
is used as a catalyst. Saba-
tier had now shown that
powdered nickel, which
was much cheaper, would
do the same.

Sabatier went on to
perfect the technique, and
nickel catalysis went on
eventually to make possible
the formation of edible fats,
such as margarine and
shortenings, from inedible
plant oils, such as cotton-
seed oil.

For this work Sabatier
was awarded a share of the
Nobel Prize in chemistry in
1912.

Mosquitoes and
Malaria

Smith'’s discovery of the
manner in which ticks
served to communicate dis-
ease (see 1893) turned the
minds of pathologists in the
direction of stinging insects
as possible disease-spread-
ers.

The British physician
Ronald Ross (1857-1932)
devoted himself to collect-
ing, feeding, and dissecting
mosquitoes until in 1897 he
discovered the malarial
parasite that had been iden-
tified by Laveran (see 1880)
in the anopheles mosquito.
This meant that malaria
might well be fought by
wiping out the breeding
places of these mosquitoes,
by making use of mosquito
netting, and so on.

For this, Ross received
the Nobel Prize in physi-
ology and medicine in
1902.
