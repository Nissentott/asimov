The Museum at Alexandria
was the site of important
early work on anatomy by
Herophilus (ca. 355—ca. 280
B.c.) and his successor, Era-
sistratus (fl. 250 B.c.). Both
were particularly inter-
ested in the brain and the
nerves. About 280 B.c., Her-
ophilus divided nerves into

made were of the tides. The
Mediterranean is a virtu-

the time some of the high
tidal water flows through
the narrow Strait of Gi-
braltar and raises the sea
level a couple of inches, it
is time for it to flow out
again.

The Greek physician Praxa-
goras (4th century B.c.) dis-

kinds of vessels we know as
arteries and veins. How-
ever, he thought arteries
carried air (they are usually
empty in corpses). That

words meaning "air-car-

the fact that the convolu-

were more numerous than
those in other animals and
suggested that this was re-

telligence. Unlike
Herophilus, he did not
think the arteries carried
blood.
