nard (b. 1922) performed
the first successful heart
transplant in history. The
patient received another
person’s heart and went on
to live with it for an addi-
tional year and a half

A period followed when
heart transplants were per-
formed in some numbers,
but their benefits proved
dubious and the ethical
problems enormous. Their
popularity subsided.

Clones

It is possible to produce
complete plant from a por-
tion of one in a way that
does not involve sexual re-
production. A plant twig,
for instance, can be grafted
to the branch of another
tree, even when the other
tree is of another species.
The twig may well grow
and flourish there, and such
a twig is called a clone,
from the Greek word for
“twig.”

Simple animals, not
too specialized, can regen-
erate an entire organism
from a relative scrap.

 

a

Sponges, fresh-water hy-
dras, flatworms, and star-
fish are all noted for this.
The new organisms may
also be called clones, by
analogy.

Among vertebrates,
cloning does not occur
spontaneously. Suppose,
though, that the nucleus of
a living skin cell of one indi-
vidual is placed into an
ovum of another individ-
ual, the ovum's own nu-
cleus having been removed.
The chromosomes of the
skin cell may then replicate
and produce new cells with
the genetic equipment of
the introduced skin cell.
The ovum may thus pro-
duce an organism, not of its
own original species but of
the species from which the
skin cell was taken. This,
too, would be a clone.

The technique of re-
placing one cell nucleus
with another is tricky. It
had first been successfully
carried through fifteen
years earlier by the Ameri-
can biologists Robert Wil-
liam Briggs (b. 1911) and
Thomas J. Ki

 

 

 

In 1967 the British biol-
ogist John B. Gurden ap-
plied this technique of a
nuclear transplantation to
transferring a cell from the
intestine of a South African
clawed frog to an egg cell of
another individual of the
same species. From that
ovum, with its alien nu-
cleus, a normal new indi-
vidual developed—a clone
of the one from which the
nucleus was taken. This
was the first clone pro-
duced of a vertebrate.

Amphibian ova are
naked and unprotected,
however. The ova of rep-
tiles and birds are pro-
tected by shells, and the
ova of mammals remain
within the body. These re-
quire much more compli-
cated techniques, and such
cloning has not vet been
achieved.

 

 

Hahnium

In 1967 the formation of ele-
ment number 105 was re-
ported in the United States,
and it was named hahniun,
after Otto Hahn (see 1917).
