The planet Uranus, discov-
ered by Herschel (see 1781),
was naturally observed fre-
quently and carefully by
many astronomers. In 1821
the French astronomer
Alexis Bouvard (1767—
1843) had shown that Ura-
nus’s position in the sky
had drifted somewhat from
the position to be expected
if the gravitational influ-
ence of the Sun and various
planets were taken into ac-
count.

One possibility was
that an as-yet-unknown
planet existed beyond Ura-
nus whose gravitational in-
fluence had not been taken
into account.

A British astronomer,
John Couch Adams (1819—
1892), attempted to calcu-
late where such a distant
planet might be in the sky
based on the discrepancy in
Uranus’s position. He made
some reasonable assump-
tions as to its mass and its
distance from the Sun, and
by October 1843, he had a
possible position located.
Unfortunately, he could not
interest the Astronomer
Royal, Airy (see 1825), in
his work.

Meanwhile, a French
astronomer, Urbain-Jean-
Joseph Leverrier (1811—
1877), was attempting the
same task independently,
and he ended with a posi-

tion very similar to that of
Adams. He wrote to a Ger-
man astronomer, Johann
Gottfried Galle (1812—
1910), and asked him if he
would check that region of
the sky,

As it happened, Galle
had a new map of that por-
tion of the sky, and when
he started looking, on Sep-
tember 23, 1846, he found
the planet almost at once,
for it was fairly bright (as
seen through the telescope).
It was not on the map.

Because of its greenish
color, the new planet was
named Neptune after the
Roman god of the sea. Al-
though Galle actually saw
the planet first, the credit
for its discovery is divided
between Adams and Lev-
errier. The whole story is
usually regarded as the
greatest victory that New-
ton's law of gravitation was
to achieve, for a tiny appar-
ent deviation from that law
was enough to lead to the
discovery of a giant planet.

Later in 1846, the Brit-
ish astronomer William
Lassell (1799-1880) discov-
ered a satellite of Neptune,
which he named Triton
after a son of Neptune (Po-
seidon) in the Greek myths.
It was a large satellite,
larger than our Moon, and
was the last large satellite
to be discovered.

Vulcan

The planet Mercury has a
moderately elliptical orbit.
At the point in its orbit that
marks its closest approach
to the Sun, called its perihe-
lion, Mercury moves for-
ward very slowly because
of the pull on it of other
planets.

Leverrier (see Neptune,
above) discovered in 1845
that, even when all plane-
tary pulls were taken into
account, Mercury's perihe-
lion advanced just a bit
more rapidly than it
should.

He thought there might
be a small planet closer to
the Sun than Mercury was,
whose gravitational pull
was not being taken into ac-
count, He named it Vulcan
after the Roman god of fire,
and beginning in 1846,
there were attempts to lo-
cate it.

All attempts to find
Vulcan failed, however, and
it was only seventy years
later that a satisfactory ex-
planation of the anomalous
advance of Mercury’s orbit
was put forward.

Biot had shown that some
substances were capable of
twisting the plane of polar-
ized light (see 1815). He
