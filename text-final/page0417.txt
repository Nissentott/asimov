search the neighborhood of
Mars for any signs of little
sparks moving about the
planet. He worked inward
toward Mars'’s surface and,
by August 11, his telescope
was trained so close to
Mars that its glare was be-
ginning to make it impossi-
ble to see anything else. He

decided to give it up and as-
sume that satellites were
not present, but his wife,
Angelina Stickney Hall,
urged him to try for one
more night.

Hall agreed, and the
next night he spotted a
small satellite. Five nights
of clouds followed, and

then on August 17 he noted
tellite. The satel-
lites were small indeed, the
smallest that had yet been
discovered, but they were
there. Hall named them
Phobos (Greek for “fear”)
and Deimos (Greek for “ter-
ror”), after the two sons of
Mars (Ares), the god of war.

Enzyme

At this time biological cata-
lysts were called ferments,
whether they existed in in-
tact cells or could be iso-
lated as nonliving
substances. The German
physiologist Wilhelm
Friedrich (Willy) Kuhne
(1837-1900) clung to a vi-
talist position and felt that
“ferment” belonged to liv-
ing systems only.

In 1878 he suggested
calling substances that
could exert a catalytic ef-
fect when separated from
living tissue enzymes (from
Greek words meaning “'in

yeast,” because enzymes
acted like materials in the
living cells of yeast).

In less than two de-
cades, however, the distinc-
tion between biological
catalysts inside and outside
cells was to be lost, and the
word enzymes, originally
implying an inferior status,
came to be applied to all
such catalysts indiscrimi-
nately.

Varves

Forty years before, Agassiz
had shown that an Ice Age
had existed in the past (see
1837). Careful studies since

had indicated the presence
of several ice ages sepa-
rated by warm interglacial
periods. However, the
times when the ice had
come and gone, or the
lengths of these ice ages
and interglacial periods,
were shrouded in uncer-
tainty.

In 1878 a Swedish geol-
ogist, Gerard Jakob de Geer
(1858-1943), studying the
sediments in glacier-fed
lakes, found that layers of
fine silt and coarser sedi-
ment alternated, depending
on whether the layers were
laid down in the winter or
in the summer
