Human
Evolution

Darwin, when writing his
book on evolution (see
1858), had deliberately re-
frained from discussing
human evolution in order
to avoid controversy. It was
impossible, however, to
suppose that biological evo-
lution had shaped life in
general but had somehow
refrained from touching
human beings. It quickly
turned out, then, that there
was no point in ignoring
the most important (to
human beings) of all as-
pects of evolution.

Now, in 1871, Darwin
published The Descent of
Man, in which he applied
the principles of evolution
to humanity specifically.
He pointed out the vestigial
organs in man as evidence
of descent from nonhuman
animals: the trace of a
point to human ears, the ex-
istence of useless muscles

that once moved those ears,
the four small bones at the
bottom of the spine that
were once tailbones, and so
on. There were still no fos-
sil remnants, however, that
could give information as
to the details of human an-
cestry. (Even the Neander-
thals were too like
ourselves to be useful in
this respect.)

Dry Plates

Until now, photography
had had to make use of solu-
tions smeared on plates or
films. These solutions were
very touchy and one had to
be an expert to get good
photographs.

In 1871 an English
chemist, Joseph Wilson
Swan (1828-1914), found
that heat increased the sen-
sitivity of the solutions, and
that even if they were
dried, the result would be
beneficial. This made possi-
ble the use of dry plates,
which greatly increased the

ease with which photo-
graphs could be taken,

It also turned out that
if the sensitive silver com-
pound was mixed with gela-
tin rather than with
collodion, exposure times
could be reduced to sec-
onds or even to fractions of
a second.

Plant Strains

In 1871 an American natu-
ralist, Luther Burbank
(1849-1926), began his
life’s work of cultivating
plants and watching for
new strains. He specialized
in producing new strains of
fruit and, for example, de-
veloped sixty varieties of
plums in his lifetime. He
also developed new varie-
ties of flowers. His work,
which caught the public
eye, beautifully illustrated
the capacity for variation
in organisms and helped
support Darwin’s theory of
evolution by natural selec-
tion.
