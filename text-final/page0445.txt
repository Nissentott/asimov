mass action of Guldberg
and Waage (see 1867) and
fit in well with Gibbs’s
chemical thermodynamics
(see 1876). It also worked as
a guidepost to direct scien-
tists in how best to bring
about desired changes in a
system.

Chromosome

Flemming's book describ-
ing chromatin and the
changes it underwent dur-
ing cell division had ap-
peared six years before (see
1882).

In 1888 the German
anatomist Heinrich
Wilhelm Gottfried von
Waldeyer-Hartz (1836—
1921) suggested that the
stubby threads of chromatin
that appeared during cell
division be called chromo-
somes. This has become one
of those scientific terms
that is well known to the
public at large.

Greenland
Ice Cap

Though the greenland coast
had first been seen by Euro-
peans nine centuries before,

no one up to this point had
explored the interior. It
was the last significant Arc-
tic landmass that remained
to be probed.

In 1888 the Norwegian
explorer Fridtjof Nansen
(1861—1930) landed on the
eastern shore of Greenland
with five others. All six
managed to cross to the in-
habited western shore in a
six-week trek. It was the
first time Greenland had
ever been crossed.

The crossing seemed to
indicate that the entire inte-
rior of Greenland was bur-
ied under a huge ice cap, a
last remnant of the Ice Age.
That one ice cap is now
known to contain about 8
percent of all the ice in the
world.

Photography

Photography was now
about half a century old,
yet it remained almost en-
tirely the province of ex-
perts and specialists,
because it took consider-
able knowledge and skill to
take and develop a photo-
graph.

The American inventor
George Eastman (1854
1932) simplihed the pro-
cess. He substituted a flex-
ible film for the large and
inflexible piece of glass on
which photographic emul-
sion was spread and dried
With a film that could be
rolled compactly, cameras
could be made much
smaller.

In 1888 Eastman devel-
oped a camera that
weighed only about 2
pounds. He called it the
Kodak, a meaningless name
but one Eastman thought
would be catchy and easily
remembered. It had the
film rolled up in it, and all
the owner had to do was to
point the camera, press a
button, then send the cam-
era to Rochester. Eventu-
ally, the photograph and
the newly loaded camera
were sent back. The Kodak
slogan was “You press the
button—we do the rest.”

There were many im-
provements to come, but
the Kodak started the pro-
cess that allowed anyone
and everyone to take photo-

  

graphs. The camera entered
the home and began to
make itself universal
