dense Venusian veil for a
close-up look at the surface,
resolving details as small
as 400 feet across and re-
turning the best images
ever.

The arid plateaus on
Venus are the size of
Earth’s continents, punctu-
ated by mountains as high
as 38,000 feet (9,000 feet
taller than Mount Everest)
and a few large craters up
to 30 miles across. An an-
cient “river” bed that may
have carried liquid sulfur
travels in an undulating
course up and down hills
across 4,800 miles, graphic
testimony to ages-old con-
vection patterns in the un-
derlying mantle.

Volcanic domes half a
mile high and 12 miles
wide dot the Venusian land-
scape. Volcanic ash is
strewn across the planet’s
surface, more than half of
which is covered with lava
flows, some as long as 125
miles. It appears that the
present shape of Venus's
landscape resulted from
convective upwelling of
molten mantle rather than
the tectonic plate activity
that has sculpted Earth's
surface.

Magellan provided sci-
entists with considerable
evidence that the volcanoes
on Venus are active. Large
crater-free areas appear to
have been recently “‘resur-
faced’ with lava. The dark

(unweathered) color of lava
at the top of Maat Mons,
the second-highest peak,
suggests that it was depos-
ited there within the past
decade or so. Some moun-
tains appear to be newly
built, and there are dra-
matic fault lines.

Such activity would
qualify the planet for mem-
bership in an exclusive club
with Earth and the moons
Io and Triton—the only
worlds where volcanic ac-
tivity is known.

First Asteroid
Photograph

On October 29, the Galileo
space probe, sent into space
in 1989 and on its way to a
rendezvous with Jupiter in
1995, traveled within 1,000
miles of the asteroid 951
Gaspra and relayed the first
black-and-white photo-
graphs ever taken of an as-
teroid in space. Gaspra
orbits the Sun between
Mars and Jupiter.
Irregularly shaped—
one astronomer said it
looked like a dented foot-
ball—Gaspra is marked
with deep, criss-crossing
grooves and heavily pitted
with more than 600 meteor-
ite craters; it is 12 miles
long and 8 miles wide.
Because of a defect in
Galileo's antenna, photos
taken the following year

were three times sharper
than the 1991 images, and
in color.

Gamma Ray
Bursts

While scanning the skies
for violations of the Nu-
clear Test-Ban Treaty in
the 1970s, U.S. government
detectors recorded bursts of
gamma rays from outside
the Solar System. Astrono-
mers wanted to know
more; as the most powerful
type of radiation, gamma
rays may be the first signals
we receive from extremely
distant heavenly bodies. In
April 1991, the space shut-
tle Atlantis put the 17-ton
Gamma Ray Observatory
(GRO) into orbit 280 miles
above Earth. Its mission
was to make the first sur-
vey of gamma-ray sources
throughout the universe
and particularly to study
such explosive energy
sources as SUpernovas, qua-
sars, neutron stars, pulsars,
and black holes.

Early data from GRO
suggested that the flash-
bulb-like bursts, which re-
lease more energy in a
tenth of a second than the
Sun releases in ten thou-
sand years, resulted from
collisions of neutron stars
with comets, gas clouds, or
other stars. After six
months, however, the GRO
