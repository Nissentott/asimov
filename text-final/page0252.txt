 

The Industrial Revolution and the Early
19th Century (1781—1850)

The year 1781, when James
Watt made a steam engine
capable of turning a wheel,
marked a new era. Steam-
generated power meant
that machines no longer
had to be tied to natural en-
ergy sources like wind and
flowing water. And with ro-
tary motion, engines could
now be used to improve the
speed and efficiency of
many types of machines.
Factories were built and
the size of machines in-
creased, as did the scale of
production. More and more
people left rural areas and
agricultural pursuits to
work in growing urban cen-
ters. Another key area of
technological advance was
transportation, which in
turn supported industry by
more quickly moving
greater numbers of people,
goods, and supplies than
ever before. Great strides
were made in the develop-
ment of electricity. In 1800
Alessandro Volta created a
primitive battery. The phe-

nomenon of electromagne-
tism was discovered in
1820 when scientists saw
that wires carrying an elec-
tric current had magnetic
properties. Probing for
more knowledge about the
phenomenon, Michael Fara-
day showed that electrical
forces could produce mo-
tion and create lines of
force. Electricity was put in
the service of chemistry
when Humphry Davy
passed an electric current
through compounds that
could not be broken up by
other means, isolating for
the first time the elements
sodium, potassium, bar-
ium, strontium, calcium,
and magnesium; this was
the beginning of electro-
chemistry. Chemistry con-
tinued to be an area of
great achievement. In 1789
Antoine Lavoisier formu-
lated the law of conserva-
tion of mass, and in 1799
Joseph-Louis Proust stated
the law of definite propor-
tions, allowing chemists to

distinguish between mix-
tures and compounds,
When he proposed his
atomic theory in 1803, John
Dalton improved on the
Greeks’ idea that all matter
was composed of tiny, indi-
visible particles by intro-
ducing the concept of
atomic weight. In 1811
Amedeo Avogadro came up
with the hypothesis that all
gases at the same volume,
pressure, and temperature
were made up of the same
number of particles; in the
process he coined the word
molecules to describe the
combinations of atoms that
made up a gas. In physics
some of the most important
work focused on the nature
of heat and its conversion
into other forms of energy.
In 1847 Hermann von
Helmholtz enunciated the
first law of thermodynam-
ics—that the total amount
of energy in the Universe is
constant. In 1848 Baron
Kelvin established the con-
cept of absolute zero and in-
