Supersonic
Transport

Once the sound barrier had
been broken (see 1947) it be-
came possible to build com-

mercial jet planes that
would routinely carry pas-
sengers at speeds greater
than sound

In 1970 such supersonic
transport (usually abbrevi-
ated SST) came into use.
The United States decided
not to build them for
sons of noise and environ-
mental damage, but Great
Britain, France, and the So-
viet Union did build them.
Although they have worked

well technologically, they
have never proved a com-
mercial success.

Mapping Mars

On May 30, 1971, the
United States launched the
Mars probe Mariner 9, and
on November 13, 1971, it
arrived at Mars and went
into orbit, the first human-
made object to be placed
into orbit about another
planet

Mars was experiencing
a planetwide dust storm as

Mariner 9 approached, but
fortunately it was poss
to have the probe study its
small satellites. They were
irregular potato-shaped
bodies, with craters as
“eyes.”” The longest diame-
ter of Phobos was 17 miles,
that of Deimos, 10 miles.
Eventually, when the
dust storm died down, Mar-
iner 9 was able to take
more than seven thousand

which served to map it com-

nals, althought there was a
huge canyon stretching for
thousands of miles. It was
named Valles Marineris.
There were numerous
craters, crowded mostly
into one hemisphere, with
volcanoes and jumbled ter-
rain in the other. The
