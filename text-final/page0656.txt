this served to ascertain the
exact route by which life
was formed, but it all
helped make it seem likely
that life did start by some
route that involved the
action of chemical and
physical laws, so that no su-
pernatural cause need be
sought.

X-Ray
Diffraction of
DNA

The fine structure of DNA
had to be worked out if in-
deed such molecules were
the carriers of genetic infor-
mation. Chargaff had made
a start by showing that the
number of purine groups
was equal to the number of
pyrimidine groups (see
1948), but there was much
more to be done.

Since nucleic acids
were long-chain polymers
of nucleotides, there ought
to be certain periodic regu-
larities in the molecule (as
in crystalsâ€”see 1914) that
would show up in X-ray dif-
fraction.

In 1952 the English bio-
physicist Rosalind Elsie
Franklin (1920-1958) made
careful X-ray diffraction
studies of DNA, from which
she deduced that the mole-
cule ought to be helical
(like a spiral staircase),

 

with the phosphate groups
that bound the units to-
gether located on the out-
side of the helix.

Franklin was a slow
and careful worker, how-
ever, and did not wish to an-
nounce a result without
carefully checking every
step. This, combined with
the fact that her coworkers
tended to ignore her be-
cause she was a woman, re-
sulted in the fruits of her
labors going to benefit oth-
ers.

Insulin
Structure

The use of paper chroma-
tography (see 1944) had
made it possible to deter-
mine the number of units of
each amino acid in a partic-
ular protein molecule. If
the molecules were broken
down to fragments made
up of two, three, or four
amino acids connected to-
gether, these could also be
isolated and identified.
Once the fragments
were identified, one could
reason out the structure of
longer stretches of the mole-
cules by arguing that a cer-
tain long stretch would
give rise to shorter pieces,
all of which would be found
among the fragments, but
would not give rise to
shorter pieces that were not

found there. In this way, lit-
tle by little, working back-
ward, one could work out
the precise order of amino
acids in the entire protein
molecule.

A British biochemist,
Frederick Sanger (b. 1918),
used this painstaking
method and, by 1952, could
show that the molecule of
the protein hormone insu-
lin consisted of some fifty
amino acids distributed
among two interconnected
chains. He was also able to
demonstrate the exact
order of the amino acids
that made up each chain.

For this, he received
the Nobel Prize for chemis-
try in 1958.

Virus Nucleic

.
Acid
There was no doubt by this
time that nucleic acid was
the genetic carrier in plant
and animal cells and even
in bacteria. That left vi-
ruses.

Viruses consist of an in-
ternal core of nucleic acid,
either DNA or RNA, or
sometimes both, and an
outer shell of protein. In
1952 Alfred Hershey (see
1945) showed that when
bacteriophages attacked
the bacterial cells that were
its natural prey, it was the
DNA that actually entered
