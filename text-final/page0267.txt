Industrial
Revolution

Great Britain's economic
position was improving
enormously with its inge-
nious new textile machin-
ery and the manner of
powering it by steam. It
was easy for the British
leaders to see that if they
could retain a monopoly on
this Industrial Revolution,
Britain might easily be-
come the strongest power
in the world—economi-
cally, at any rate.

For this reason, what
we would today call an
“iron curtain”’ was
clamped down. Blueprints
of the new machinery were
not allowed to leave the
country, and neither were
engineers who were experts
in the new technology.

The new nation of the
United States wanted the
new technology to aid in its
economic independence

 

 

 

from Great Britain, without
which its political indepen-
dence wouldn't amount to
much. It therefore did its
best to steal the knowledge
by encouraging defectors. It
found its man in Samuel
Slater (1768-1835).

Slater was an engineer
who knew the new technol-
ogy intimately, but who
also knew that he could ad-
vance only so far in the
class-ridden society of
Great Britain. The United
States was offering money
for his knowledge and he
decided to go for it. He
couldn't take any blue-
prints with him, of course,
so he painstakingly went
about memorizing every de-
tail of the machinery. He
then disguised himself as a

arm laborer and sneaked

out of the country. In 1789
he arrived in the United
States and made contact
with rich merchants in
Rhode Island.

In 1790, working from

 

memory, Slater began
building the first American
factory based on the new
machinery, in Pawtucket,
Rhode Island.

In this way, the Indus-
trial Revolution came to
the United States, and once
the process of proliferation
began there was no stop-
ping it. It continues to this
day. Of course, when other
nations try to make use of
our technology in the same
way that we made use of
Great Britain's, we are,
very naturally, indignant.

 

 

Metric System

Throughout history, every
nation, sometimes every re-
gion within a nation, has
developed its own system
of measurements. As long
as trade was slow and com-
munication was limited,
that was merely an annoy-

 

ance. However, as the eco-
nomic interdependence of

Europe increased ra
