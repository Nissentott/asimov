There is evidence that they

neanderthalensis and are
considered one of the two
known subspecies of Homo
sapiens. We moderns are
the other.

The Neanderthals lived
from 200,000 B.c. to 30,000

were scavenged by preda

rotted. The fact that Nean
derthals buried their dead,
thus preserving them from
scavengers, 1f not from
