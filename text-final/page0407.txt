low and the temperature is
high, these facts scarcely
matter, but as pressure
goes up and temperature
goes down, the facts grow
increasingly important.

In 1873 van der Waals
introduced a modified equa-
tion that gases followed
much more closely than
they do the simpler, unmod-
ified one. Only perfect gases
(which have zero-volume
molecules and no intermo-
lecular attraction—and
which don'’t exist in reality)
follow the unmodified equa-
tions.

As a result of van der
Waals's work, it could be
seen that the Joule-Thom-
son effect—that gases cool
as they expand (see 1852)—
only holds below a certain
temperature. For most
gases, that doesn’t matter,
because the temperature
below which the effect
holds is quite high. In the
case of hydrogen, however,
that temperature is quite
low, so that attempts to lig-
uefy hydrogen by means of
the Joule-Thomson effect
would fail if the gas was
not sufficiently cooled to
begin with.

In 1910 van der Waals
received a Nobel Prize in
physics for this work.

Leprosy

Leprosy, a deadly and dis-
figuring but slow disease,
had been known and

dreaded from ancient
times. A Norwegian physi-
cian, Gerhard Henrik Arm-
auer Hansen (1841-1912),
was in charge of a leper hos-
pital in Norway in 1873
when he found that a spe-
cific bacterium was the
cause of the disease. As a re-
sult, leprosy came to be
called Hansen's disease.

This was the first occa-
sion on which a particular
microorganism was found
to be the cause of a particu-
lar disease. Many other
cases followed.

Transcendental
Numbers

An algebraic number is one
that can serve as a solution
to a polynomial equation
made up of x and powers of
x. All integers and all frac-
tions can serve as solutions
to such equations and so can
certain irrational numbers.

Those irrational num-
bers that cannot serve as so-
lutions are called
transcendental numbers
(from Latin words meaning
"“to climb beyond," since
they climb beyond the alge-
braic numbers to further
heights). The trick is, how-
ever, to prove that a
particular number is
transcendental and that no
conceivable polynomial
equation can yield it as a re-
sult.

In 1873 a French math-

ematician, Charles Hermite
(1822-1901), succeeded in
showing that e (a very im-
portant quantity in
mathematics, equal to
2.71828 .. .) is transcen-
dental. This was the first
transcendental number to
be identified.

Platelets

Red blood corpuscles had
been known since Swam-
merdam had discovered
them over two centuries be-
fore (see 1658). White blood
cells, or lericocytes (from

the Greek for “white cell”),
are larger, but there are far
fewer of them in the blood,
and they had not been stud-
ied carefully till the British
physician Thomas Addison
(1798-1866) had done so
three decades before.

A third type of formed
object in the blood had first
been reported in 1842.

Even smaller than red
blood corpuscles and not as
numerous (though more nu-
merous than white blood
corpuscles), they were first
studied carefully by a Cana-
dian physician, William
Osler (1849-1919), who re-
ported on them in 1873.
They were called platelets
from their shape. Eventu-
ally they were found to be
intimately involved with
blood clotting and also
came to be called thrombao-
cytes (from the Greek for
“clot cells™).
