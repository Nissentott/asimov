Mossbauer
Effect

Ordinarily, when an atom
emits a gamma ray, it re-
coils. The wavelength of the
gamma ray depends in part
on the extent of this recoil.
Since this varies somewhat
from atom to atom, the
gamma rays emitted show
a spread of wavelength.
The German physicist
Rudolf Ludwig Méssbauer
(b. 1929) studied conditions
under which atoms that
were part of a crystal
would emit a gamma ray in
such a way that the recoil
would be spread over all
the atoms making up the

 

crystal. The recoil is then
vanishingly slight, and the

 

 

gamma ray wavelength
shows no spread due to
that recoil. As a result, the
crystal emits a sharply
monochromatic beam ol
gamma rays, and this, dis-

covered in 1938, is called
the Méssbauer effect.

Gamma rays emitted
in this way by one crystal
will be easily absorbed by
another crystal of the same
type, but if the wavelength
varies even slightly in ei-
ther direction, absorption
will not take place. For this
work, Mdssbauer received a
share of the Nobel Prize for
physics in 1961.

 

Solar X Rays

The fir|

possible to detect X rays

ing [rom astronomical
objects. Such X rays could
not be dete

sorbed them.

In 1958 the American
astronomer Herbert Fried
i (b, 1916) observed the

means ol rocket-borne

instruments, and detected
X rays coming from the
Sun's corona.
Two years belore, he
had shown that solar flares
emitted X rays, but that
was not surprising in view
of the fact that flares were

 

clearly very energetic solar
explosions. X rays from the
apparently quiet corona
were more surprising, but
this supported the claim of
the Swedish physicist
Bengt Edlen (b. 1906), who
in 1940, as a result of study-
ing the ultraviolet radia-

1 from the Sun, had
claimed that the corona

must have a temperature ol

 

 

a million degrees or so
This does not mean
that the Solar corona is a
great reservoir ol heat. It is
1 volume of extraordinarily
thin gas, where the individ
t deal

ual atoms have a gre

   

of heat individually (henc
the temperature), but
