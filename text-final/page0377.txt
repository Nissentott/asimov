understanding that atoms
were more than tiny little

balls.

 

 

Oil Wells

Petroleum (from Latin
words meaning “rock oil"),
sometimes called simply
oil, is a complex mixture of
hydrocarbons, formed, it is
believed, from the fat con-
tent of myriads of microor-
ganisms in the distant past.

In the Middle East,
where petroleum is particu-
larly common, some was
found even on the surface.
There the smaller mole-
cules evaporated, leaving
behind a tarry substance
variously called pitch, bitu-
men, and asphalt. This was
used in waterproofing.

From pitch one could also
sometimes extract an in-
flammable liquid called
naphtha (from a Persian
word meaning “liquid”),
which could be used in
lamps.

There was a limit to
what could be obtained on
the surface, however. It was
also possible to dig for it.
Two thousand years before,
the Chinese had dug for
brine and occasionally ob-
tained oil.

An American railway
conductor, Edwin Lauren-
tine Drake (1819-1880),
had invested in a firm that
thered oil for medicinal

 

 

purposes, from seepages
near Titusville, Pennsylva-
nia. It occurred to Drake,
who knew about the brine-
drilling, that oil could be
drilled for as brine was.
He studied drilling
methods and, in 1859, set
about using those methods
at Titusville. He drilled 69
feet into the ground and, on
August 28, struck oil. He
had drilled the first oil
well, which was soon pro-
ducing 400 gallons per day
Other drillings fol-
lowed, and other oil wells

 

The first consequence of
this was that kerosene
