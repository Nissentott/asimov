Vaccination

Inoculation had been used
to fight smallpox for some
eighty years (see 1713), but
it was dangerous.

The English physician
Edward Jenner (1749-
1823) knew that in his na-
tive Gloucestershire there
were tales to the effect that
anyone who caught cowpox
(a very mild disease, preva-
lent among cows, that
somewhat resembled small-
pox) was thereafter im-
mune not only to cowpox
but also to smallpox. (Since
milkmaids almost invari-
ably caught cowpox early
and then never got small-
pox, they retained a clear
complexion. This in itself
may have been enough to
fuel the romantic clich√© of
the time concerning pretty
milkmaids.)

Finally Jenner decided
to test the matter. On May
14, 1796, he found a milk-
maid who was undergoing
an attack of cowpox. He
took the fluid from a blister
on her hand and injected it
into an eight-year-old boy

named James Phipps who,
of course, got cowpox. Two
months later, Jenner inocu-
lated the boy with small-
pox in the manner usual for
those days. The boy did not
get smallpox. Two years
later, he found someone
else with active cowpox
and tried again. It worked
this time also, and he felt it
safe to announce his discov-
ery.

The Latin word for cow
is vacea, so C()\\'pox lS vac-
cinia. Jenner coined the
word vaccination to de-
scribe his use of cowpox in-
oculation to create
immunity to smallpox. In
this way, he founded the sci-
ence of immunology.

Such was the dread of
smallpox that the new
technique was instantly
adopted and quickly spread
all over Europe. It was the
first case of a serious and
frightening disease that
could be reliably pre-
vented.

Nebular
Hypothesis

Kant's suggestion (see
1755) that the Solar System
had formed from the con-
densation of a vast nebula
of dust and gas had gone
mostly unnoticed.

In 1796, however,
Laplace (see 1783) had
published a popular
nonmathematical book on
astronomy and, in the ap-
pendix, had made a similar
suggestion, describing it in
much greater detail. As the
condensing cloud spun
faster and faster, he ex-
plained, first one ring of
gas, then another and an-
other were given off. The
rings condensed to form the
planet, The planets, in con-
densing, gave off smaller
rings that formed the satel-
lites.

Laplace felt that cer-
tain nebulas visible in
space were themselves con-
tracting and represented
planetary systems in the
process of formation. His
suggestion was therefore
