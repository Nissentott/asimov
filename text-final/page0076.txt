Silk

Chinese legends have it
that silk culture was intro-
duced in China in 2640 B.C.,
but this may be taken with
a certain skepticism.
During the time of the
Roman Empire, silk
reached the Western world
over the Silk Road, which
ran the width of Asia. With
every tribe en route charg-
ing to let the silk through,

 

600

it arrived in Rome worth
its weight in gold. Since the
Roman aristocracy insisted
on silk and on other exotic
luxuries from the East,
however, the trade balance
was heavily against

Rome, and this undoubt-
edly contributed to its
decay.

Then a neo-Persian Em-
pire was formed, which
was so hostile to the Ro-
mans that silk was not al-

lowed to pass through at
all.

Justinian (see 537)
therefore arranged to have
two Persian monks who
had lived in China go there
and bring back silkworm
eggs secreted in hollow
bamboo canes. In 552 Con-
stantinople began silk pro-
duction itself, and from
that time to this the West
has had its own silk.

 

Moldboard
Plows

The Slavs of eastern Eu-
rope were hard-working
peasants who were exposed
in their vast plains to inva-
sion from the north and the
east. Both the Goths and
the Huns dominated them,
and later on, so would
other invaders. (The word

slave may have come from
Slav because they seemed
so easily enslaved.) Never-
theless, they endured and
multiplied and contributed
an important advance.
About 600, they are
supposed to have invented
the moldboard plow. This
had a knife blade, or
cotilter, that cut deep into
the ground, a plowshare
that cut grass and stubble

at ground level, and a
shaped moldboard above
the plowshare that lifted
and turned the soil, This
was a useful device for
damp, moist ground. It
wasn't needed in the light
Mediterranean soil, but as
it slowly spread through
eastern and northern Eu-
rope, food production took
a jump and population
grew.
