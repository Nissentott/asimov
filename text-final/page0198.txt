1698

 

Miner’s Friend

England, short of wood,
turned increasingly to coal,
but coal mines in England’s
damp climate tended to fill
with water, and the water
had to be pumped out at
the cost of much labor, in
volving both human and an-
imal muscle.

An English engineer,
Thomas Savery (1650?—
1715), knew of the power of
the vacuum as demon-
strated by Guericke (see
1645). It occurred to him
that one could create a
vacuum by filling a vessel
with hot steam and then
cooling it so that the steam
turned to a few drops of
water. If the vessel were
connected to a tube reach-
ing down into the water at
the bottom of the mine, the
water could be sucked up
as much as 33 feet (see
1643). It could then be
blown out by more steam,
which would fill the vessel
—and be cooled again to

suck up another batch of
water.

Savery built such
pumps in 1698 and called
them the Miner's Friend. A
few even came to be used.
However, they made use of
high-pressure steam, and
the technology of the day
was not able to handle such
steam safely. Besides, it
took a great deal of fuel to
heat water to form the nec-
essary steam, and most of
the coal obtained with the
help of the Miner's Friend
had to be used in operating
the device.

Nevertheless, Savery's
pump got people to think-
ing about using steam
power, and much was to
come of that.

Scientific
Voyages

Voyages undertaken for ex-
ploration, settlement, or
trade might also produce
scientific knowledge as a

side effect, as Columbus’s
first voyage did when he
observed magnetic
declination (see 1492), or
Magellan’s when the Magel-
lanic Clouds were observed
(see 1678). In 1698, how-
ever, an ocean voyage was
undertaken, for the first
time, that was for the spe-
cific purpose of scientific in-
vestigation and nothing
more.

The ship was the Par-
amour Pink and it was
under the command of Hal-
ley (see 1678). He remained
at sea for two years, mea-
sured magnetic declina-
tions all over the world,
and prepared the first map
of the world showing the
wiggling lines of equal dec-
lination. He also did his
best to determine accurate
latitudes and longitudes for
the various ports he
stopped at.
