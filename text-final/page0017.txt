continually to prevent leaks
and breakdowns.

All this irrigation (from
Latin words meaning "'to
water inward’’) more or
less guarantees a good har-
vest and an ample food sup-
ply, at the cost of
unremitting labor.

This labor cannot be
done alone, nor can it be
done by various people,
each in his or her own way
and at his and her own
time. Irrigation requires co-
operation. Many farms de-
pend upon it, and the labor
of many has to be super-
vised to make a coherent
whole, so that the levees
are in good shape every-
where.

As a result, the farms
depend upon control by ca-
pable leaders who can su-
pervise the work and allot
the tasks, encourage the in-
dustrious and capable, and

punish the idle or incompe-
tent. In short, irrigation
leads to the formation of
what we call government, so
that a cluster of farms sur-
rounding a defensible city
becomes a city-state, with a
ruler and established rules
of behavior.

The first such city-
states formed along the
lower courses of the Eu-
phrates and Tigris rivers in
what is now southern Iraq
(but was then known as
Sumeria) about 5000 B.c.
Other city-states developed
at nearly the same time
along the Nile River in
Egypt. It almost never
rains in Egypt, but the Nile
remains a reliable water
supply and overflows regu-
larly once a year when the
rainy season takes place far
to the south, nearer its
source. The Nile (lood de-
posits fertile mud over the
farms on its banks.

Scales

Trade is bound to lead 1o
measurement—so much of
this for so much of that.
You can heft things by
hand, but that is subjective
and buyer and seller will
never agree. The easiest
way to be abjective is 1o
hang two pans from oppo-
site ends of a rod that is
held up in the middle. The
thing being weighed is
placed in one pan, and stan-
dard weights are placed in
the other until the two pans
are in balance. The princi-
ple is so simple and the de-
vice itself so easy to make
that it may have been used
as early as 5000 B.c. in
Egypt and have been rea-
sonably accurate.

From the early days of
Homo habilis 1o 4000 B.c. or
thereabouts, a period of
two million years, tools and
weapons were made of
stone, wood, or bone. Stone
is the most durable of these
and the most likely to re-
main as evidence of long-

past human activity. As a
result, that long period is
known as the Stone Age, a
term first used by the
Roman poet Titus Lucre-
tius Carus (95-55 B.c.) and
reintroduced by a Danish

archacologist, Christian Jiir-

gensen Thomsen (1788-
1865), in 1834.
The Stone Age is di-

vided into the Paleolithic,
the Mesolithie, and the Neo-
lithic (from Latin words
meaning “Old Stone,"”
“"Middle Stone,” and " New
Stone," respectively) based
on advancing techniques of
handling the stone.
