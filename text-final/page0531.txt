after passing close to the
Sun and bending in its path
very slightly as it did so, so
that each star would be
seen a bit farther from the
Sun than it really was. This
would appear if the same
region of the sky was photo-
graphed when the Sun was
in another part of the sky.
However, World War I
was raging and there was no
way any eclipse expedition
could be safely organized.
In fact, it was difficult to
get word of Einstein’s
views out of Germany. So
the world had to wait.

Black Holes

After Einstein's equations
for general relativity were
published, the first to work
out solutions for them was
a German astronomer, Karl
Schwarzschild (1873—
1916). He also calculated
the gravitational phenom-
ena in the neighborhood of
a star with all its mass con-
centrated to a point.

In order for an object
to move infinitely far from
a body as the result of a sin-
gle initial impulse, that ini-
tial impulse must produce
a speed that will carry the
object away so rapidly that
its speed will not decline as
quickly as does the gravita-
tional pull (which declines
with the square of the in-
creasing distance). In that
case, the gravitational pull

will never be intense
enough to bring the object
to a complete halt. This es-
cape velocity equals 7 miles
per second for Earth but
only 1.5 miles per second
for the Moon.

In general, the escape
velocity from an object’s
surface increases with the
mass of the attracting ob-
ject and also with its den-
sity. Over a century earlier,
Laplace (see 1783) had
pointed out that if an ob-
ject was sufficiently mas-
sive and dense, even light
wouldn’t have sufficient ve-
locity to escape.

Schwarzschild studied
the case of a star with a
mass compressed more and
more strongly till the star’s
volume sank to zero, so
that the gravitational pull
at its surface got higher
and higher without limit.
Schwarzschild calculated
the distance from such a
point-mass at which light
would barely have the
speed to escape. This is the
Schwarzschild radius. Once
anything approached closer
to the star than the
Schwarzschild radius, it
could never escape again.
Not even light could.

Since nothing could es-
cape, not even light, such a
star would behave like a
bottomless hole in space, so
to speak. It would be a
black hole, a name given to
it half a century later.

Electrons and
Chemical Bonds

Once Moseley had ad-
vanced his notion of atomic
numbers (see 1914), it was
understood that the neutral
atom contained as many
electrons in its outskirts as
the value of the atomic
number. A hydrogen atom
had one planetary electron,
a uranium atom had nine-
ty-two, and the other ele-
ments had numbers in
between.

What's more, study of
the characteristic X rays of
elements, which had been
initiated by Barkla (see
1906), gave rise to the no-
tion that the electrons ex-
isted in successive shells,
Clearly, it was the electrons
in the outermost shell that
were most exposed and
were therefore most capa-
ble of being removed, or of
being shifted from ene
atom to another. The Ger-
man chemist Richard Wil-
helm Heinrich Abegg
(1869-1910) had already
suggested in 1904, even be-
fore the details of electron
shells had been worked out,
that chemical reactions
were the result of electrons
being transferred from one
atom to another.

An American chemist,
Gilbert Newton Lewis
(1875-1946), went into the
matter in greater detail. He
