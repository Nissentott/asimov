Size of Earth

Even after the Earth was
known to be spherical,
there was the question of
how large that sphere
might be. It was bound to
be huge, since no traveler
had ever been totally
around it. There was al-
ways more Earth, unknown
and as yet unvisited, up
ahead.

But then a Greek
scholar, Eratosthenes (ca.
276—ca. 194 B.Cc.), working
at Alexandria, found a way
to measure the Earth'’s cir-
cumference without leaving
Egypt. At the summer sol-
stice, he had been told, the
Sun at noon cast no
shadow at the city of Syene
(modern Aswan), which
was far south of Alexan-
dria. That meant that the
Sun was then directly over-
head at Syene. At the same
time, though, the Sun was

7 degrees from the zenith in
Alexandria. This difference
had to result from the fact
that the Earth curved be-
tween Syene and Alexan-
dria. Knowing the north-
south distance from Syene
to Alexandria, Eratosthenes
could use mathematics to
calculate how far it would
take the curvature of the
Earth, worked out between
Syene and Alexandria, to
take him all the way
around the Earth.

He came out with a
length of 25,000 miles for
Earth’s circumference. He
was correct.

The ancients, however,
thought his figure was too
high and preferred to ac-
cept a lower one.

Chronology

No two political groupings
among the ancients
counted the yearsin the

same way. Usually it was
by strictly local methods—
a given year was “the year
when so-and-so ruled the
city,” or “the seventh year
of King so-and-so.”” Not
only was it difficult to
match the chronologies of
one political unit with an-
other, but even within a
given political unit things
were hazy if you forgot the
order of the rulers or how
long each had ruled.
Eratosthenes (see
above) was the first person
to try to make sense out of
chronology and to match
one system with another.
He did his best to stretch
dating back to the time of
the Trojan War.
Meanwhile, Alexander
the Great's general Seleu-
cus I (ca. 358-281 B.c.) had
marched into Babylon in
312 B.c. and counted that as
year | of the Seleucid Era.
The years were counted up-
