Mechanism of
Evolution

While the fact that biologi-
cal evolution had taken
place was suspected by
many scientists, until now
no one had suggested a
mechanism that would
allow it to take place. Why
should some catlike crea-
ture in the course of genera-
tion after generation slowly
change, some into lions,
some into tigers, and some
into pussycats?

The first to attempt an
answer was Lamarck (see
1801) in his book Zoological
Philosophy, published in
1809. Here he suggested
that particular animals
might use a part of the
body steadily, or not use it,
and that those parts might
develop slightly or degener-
ate slightly as a result, and
that such developed or de-
generated parts could be in-
herited by their young,
which, by use or disuse,
would continue the process.

Thus some antelopes,
by stretching upward to
reach leaves, would gradu-
ally develop slightly longer
necks and legs, which
would be inherited by the
young, which, also strain-
ing, would continue the pro-
cess so that the giraffe
would evolve. Other ante-
lopes, by dint of constantly
fleeing from predators,
strengthened their leg mus-
cles and became very fleet
as the generations pro-
gressed. Water birds, by
using their feet to push
water backward, developed
webs, while moles, who
didnâ€™t need eyes under-
ground, gradually lost
them.

This sort of thing is re-
ferred to as the inheritance
of acquired characteristics.
Experiments would show
that acquired characteris-
tics were not inherited. Nev-
ertheless, the advancement
of a mechanism for evolu-
tion, even if a wrong one,
heightened interest in the
matter.

Aerodynamics

The dream of active (light
had exercised the human
imagination for millenia.
Usually, however, human
beings could only think of
imitating the birds. The
Greek myth of Daedalus
had that legendary inven-
tor building a frame to
which he stuck feathers in
wax and which he moved
in birdlike fashion with his
arms.

The first person to con-
sider the principles that
would really keep objects
in the air was a British sci-
entist, George Cayley
(1773-1857). He visualized
flying devices with fixed
wings that presented appro-
priate surfaces to the air
tails with control surfaces
to allow turning and brak-
ing, and praopulsive mecha-
nisms. He described all this
in publications that began
to appear in 1809.

In these he founded the
science of aerodynamniics
While the state of technol-
