In the period after World
War II, new knowledge and
new technology empowered
individuals in ways that
could have been the stuff of
science fiction only decades
earlier. The Space Age
began in 1957 with the
launch by the Soviet Union
of the satellite Sputnik I.
When the Soviets sent up
the Moon probe Lunik I in
1959, for the first time in
history a human-made ob-
ject rested on the surface of
another world. U.S. astro-
naut Neil Alden Armstrong
was the first human being
to set foot on any werld
other than Earth when in
1969 he stepped onto the
surface of the Moon. The
first human-made object
was placed in orbit around
another planet in 1971
when Mariner 9 arrived at
Mars during a dust storm.
The same year the Soviet
Union placed in orbit the
prototype of a space sta-
tion. Even as space opened
to scientists, so did our
planet and the makeup of
the human body. In 1953
two American physicists de-
scribed the crust of Earth
as divided into tightly
joined plates—six large
ones and numerous smaller
ones—along the boundaries
of which earthquake activ-

ity and volcanoes are con-
centrated. The study of
plate tectonics revolution-
ized geology. Some of the
most dramatic scientific ad-
vances in the late twentieth
century have been in genet-
ics. In 1944 Oswald Theo-
dore Avery had shown that
deoxyribonucleic acid
(DNA)—not protein—made
up the genes of the chromo-
somes. Then in 1953 Fran-
cis Crick and James Dewey
Watson, using data and
X-ray photographs from
earlier studies, suggested
that DNA was arranged as
a double helix and that it
underwent replication
without changing its struc-
ture except for occasional
mutations. Further steps to-
ward working out the ge-
netic code took place over
the next decade, and other
techniques led to the begin-
ning of genetic engineering.
Many of the medical thera-
pies that we now take for
granted were developed
since 1945. Organ trans-
plants, artificial organs,
and other supports and sur-
gical therapies for organs
were developed starting in
the mid-1950s. The first suc-
cessful kidney transplant
took place in 1954, and cor-
onary medicine began to
make dramatic advances in

1953, as the first workable
heart-lung machine made it
possible to perform open-
heart surgery without en-
dangering the patient’s life.
Perhaps nothing altered the
way Americans worked and
communicated during this
period as much as the com-
puter, which began to be
mass-produced and used in
industry during the early
1950s. The most important
technological advance of
the century was almost cer-
tainly the transistor, a
small, rugged device that
transmitted current more
efficiently than radio tubes.
By 1975 microchip circuitry
had become so small that
personal computers began
to be used not only by sci-
ence and business but by the
general public as well. The
development of the personal
computer and of fiber-optic
technology as the optimal
means of conducting sound
waves was seen to have enor-
mous potential for commu-
nications. The twentieth
century is closing with a vi-
sion of enormous channels
of information—visual, fac-
tual, aural—flowing into of-
fices, schools, homes, and
even personal devices that
could potentially link us all
together in a vast communi-
cations network.
