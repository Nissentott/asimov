tral Europe because of Ger-
man anti-Semitism, and
the brains that Germany
thus rejected and the allies
absorbed were eventually
to prove of inestimable
help to the allies. Szilard
patented the notion of a nu-
clear chain reaction and of-
fered it to Great Britain.

The nuclear reactions
known in 1932 and for sev-
eral years afterward were
not suitable for nuclear
chain reactions, however. It
took a fast, energetic neu-
tron to eject two neutrons,
but those two ejected neu-
trons were too slow, too
lacking in energy, to con-
tinue the chain.

In 1939, however, when
Szilard heard of nuclear
fission, which was brought
about by slow neutrons, he
realized that a nuclear
chain reaction and a nu-
clear bomb were finally pos-
sible, and he promptly
began a campaign to per-
suade American scientists
to keep their researches
into such things secret. To
a large extent, he suc-
ceeded.

Francium

Only three elements re-
mained undiscovered: num-
bers 61, 85, and 87. In 1939
the French physicist Mar-
guerite Perey (1909-1975),
working with the radioac-

tive element actinium, dis-
covered a type of beta
activity that was not quite
like that of any known iso-
tope. She tracked it down
and found that it resulted
from the breakdown of an
isotope of element number
87. She named it francium,
for her native country.

As it turned out, the
most nearly stable isotope
of the element is francium-
223, which has a half-life of
only 22 minutes. Of all the
elements between 1 and 92,
francium is the only one
that possesses no isotope
with a half-life of as much
as half an hour.

Neutron Stars

Zwicky had suggested the
possible existence of a neu-
tron star (see 1934). In 1939
Oppenheimer (see 1937) an-
alyzed the possibilities
mathematically, in the
light of what was known of
nuclear reactions. Never-
theless, the matter re-
mained strictly theoretical,
for no such object had actu-
ally been observed, or
would be for another thirty
years.

Magnetic
Moments

The magnetic properties of
atoms and molecules had
been determined by the

P

studies of molecular beams
undertaken by Stern (see
1933) and by Rabi (see
1938).

The Swiss-born Ameri-
can physicist Felix Bloch
(1905-1983) worked out
methods for determining
the magnetic properties of
molecules within liquids
and solids. From this work,
he calculated the magnetic
moment of the neutron.
This was important, be-
cause the neutron is not an
electrically charged parti-
cle and should therefore
have no magnetic field. Yet
Bloch demonstrated that it
had.

This was the first indi-
cation that the neutron
might be a composite parti-
cle, made up of more funda-
mental particles that did
have electrical charges.

The fact that the neu-
tron had a magnetic mo-
ment, incidentally, showed
that such a thing as an anti-
neutron could exist, which
would have a magnetic
field pointed in the direc-
tion opposite to that of the
neutron.

The magnetic moment
of the neutron was indepen-
dently worked out at about
the same time in another
way by the American physi-
cist Edward Mills Purcell
(b. 1912). As a result, Bloch
and Purcell shared the
Naobel Prize for physics in
1952.
