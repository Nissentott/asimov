  

the substances they were
studying. In 1823 the Ger-
man chemist Justus von
Liebig (1803—-1873) was
studying a class of sub-
stances known as fulmi-
nates. Silver fulminate, for
instance, has a molecule in
which there is one atom
each of silver, carbon, nitro-
gen, and oxygen.

At the same time, an-
other German chemist,
Friedrich Wéhler (1800—
1882), was studying a class
of substances known as iso-
cvanates. Silver isocyanate
also has a molecule con-
taining one atom each of sil-
ver, carbon, nitrogen, and
oxgyen.

Both chemists submit-
ted their reports for publi-
cation to a journal of which
Gay-Lussac (see 1804, Sci-
entific Ballooning) was edi-
tor. He noticed that the
molecular formulas were
the same, yet the com-
pounds had quite different
properties. He told Berze-
lius (see 1803), who pre-
pared both compounds and
found that it was true:
same formula, different
properties. Berzelius re-
ferred to such unlike twins
as isomers (from Greek
words meaning “‘equal

This was the first indi-
cation that counting the
atoms in a molecule was
not enough; it was also nec-
essary to consider the ar-
rangements of those atoms.

The more complicated the
molecule, the more likely it
was that there would be nu-
merous isomers. Since the
molecules in living tissue
tend to be far more compli-
cated than the molecules in
the inanimate world, iso-
merism became particu-
larly important to organic
chemists.

Liquefying
Gases

Generally speaking, there
are two ways of making a
gas condense into a liquid.
You can cool it. This de-
prives the gas of energy,
and its molecules sink to-
ward each other and cling
together. You can also put
it under pressure. This
forces the molecules to-
ward each other until they
cling. Naturally, if you use
cold and pressure, you do
better still.

Michael Faraday (see
1821) was the first to use
cold and pressure in a sys-
tematic attempt to liquefy
gases. He used a strong
glass tube bent into a boo-
merang shape. In the closed
bottom, he placed some
substance that, when
heated, would liberate the
gas he was trying to lig-
uefy. He then sealed the
open end. He placed the
bottom end in hot water.
This liberated the gas in
greater and greater quanti-

ties and, since the gas was
in the limited space within
the tube, it developed
greater and greater pres-
sure.

The other end of the
tube Faraday kept in a bea-
ker filled with crushed ice.
At that end the gas would
be subjected to both high
pressure and low tempera-
ture and would liguefy. In
1823 Faraday liquefied the
gas chlorine in this man-
ner. (Chlorine’s normal lig-
uefaction point is —34°C.)
Using this method, Faraday
liquefied several other
gases, 100.

Electromagnets

Three years earlier, Ampére
(see 1820) had shown that a
wire helix (or solenoid,
from a Greek word mean-
ing “pipelike,” because
such a helix looks like a
pipe with its walls made of
turns of wire) acts like a
bar magnet when electric-
ity flows through the wires.

In 1823 an English
physicist, William Stur-
geon (1783-1850), placed
an iron bar within a sole-
noid of eighteen turns. He
found that the iron seemed
to concentrate the mag-
netic field and make it
stronger.

Sturgeon varnished the
iron bar to insulate it and
keep it from short-circuit-
ing the wires. He used one
that was bent into the
