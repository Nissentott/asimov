Tryptophan

By now, some thirteen dif-
ferent amino acids had
been isolated, each of
which were among the
building blocks of protein
molecules. Still another
was isolated in 1900 by the
British biochemist Freder-
ick Gowland Hopkins
(1861—-1947). He called it
tryptophan, from Greek
words meaning “appearing
through trypsin,” because
he had obtained it from pro-
tein molecules that had
been broken down by the di-
gestive enzyme trypsin.

A French physiologist,
Francois Magendie (1783—
1855), had shown, in 1815,
that animals could not be
kept alive if gelatin was the
only protein fed them. Hop-
kins found that tryptophan
did not occur in gelatin,
and he suggested that tryp-
tophan could not be formed
in the body from other sub-
stances but had to be pres-
ent as such in the diet.

All the amino acids
that are found as part of
protein molecules are essen-
tial to life, but only some
are essential as such in the
diet. It is to these latter
that the term essential

 

amino acids refers. Hopkins
originated this concept,
and it proved an important
finding in the field of dietet-
ics and food chemistry.

Free Radicals

Organic chemists find it in-
teresting to try to synthe-
size compounds of unusual
structure. The Russian-
born American chemist
Moses Gomberg (1866—
1947) tried to attach a car-
bon atom to four different
benzene rings. There is
scarcely room around a sin-
gle carbon atom for four
such bulky groupings, and
a number of chemists had
tried and failed. Gomberg,
however, succeeded in
forming small quantities of
this compound, called tetra-
phenylmethane.

He next tried to attach
six benzene rings to two
carbon atoms hooked to-
gether, thus forming hexa-
phenylethane. This he could
not do, but he did get a
strongly colored compound
that did not have the prop-
erties to be expected of hex-
aphenylethane.

Gomberg studied the
colored compound care-
fully and, in 1900, came to
the conclusion that he had
a half-molecule. The hexa-
phenylethane tended to
break in two and leave him
with two single carbon
atoms, each with three ben-

zene rings attached—triphe-
nylmethyl.

Ordinarily the carbon
atom is attached to four dif-
ferent groups, but in this
case it was attached to only
three, while the fourth
bond was unoccupied.
When compounds form,
there may be moments
when a carbon atom loses a
fourth attachment and has
not yet gained a substitute
attachment, but this usu-
ally lasts such a brief time
that it isn't noticeable.

Such groupings with a
carbon bond unattached
are called radicals. Some-
thing like triphenylmethyl,
which lasts for a percepti-
ble time, is called a free radi-
cal. The explanation for the
existence of such free radi-
cals was not advanced for
over three decades more.

Dirigible
Balloons had been in opera-
tion for over a century, and
it was easy to see that if one
could place a steam engine
in a balloon's gondola and
attach a propeller to it, the
balloon might be guided in
any desired direction, even
dead against the wind.
However, steam engines
are very heavy, and sup-
porting one by balloon
would not be easy.

The coming of Otto's in-
ternal-combustion engine
(see 1876) offered a much
