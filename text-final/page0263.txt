 

However, a prize was
offered for the first person
who could accomplish the
feat, and in 1786 a French
doctor, Michel-Gabriel Pac-
card (1757-1827), along
with a porter, Jacques Bal-
mat, won the prize.

As often happens once
one person accomplishes a
feat previously considered
impossible, others at once
find out they can duplicate
it. Paccard’s climb initiated
a virtual frenzy of moun-
tain-climbing (among

British aristocrats particu-
larly). Sometimes this was
for scientific purposes, but
often it was merely for the
excitement and adventure
of it, as was the case with
ballooning.

Charles’s Law

Amontons had discovered
the relationship between
the volume of gas and its
temperature (see 1699). For
some reason, the discovery
was neglected. Charles (see
1783) rediscovered the rela-
tionship in 1787, however,
and the French chemist
Joseph-Louis Gay-Lussac
(1778-1850) again rediscov-
ered it five years later. The
relationship is sometimes
called Charles’s law and
sometimes, Gay-Lussac’s
law. Amontons remains for-
gotten.

The amount by which a
gas shrank as the tempera-

ture decreased by 1 degree
Celsius was '73 of its vol-
ume at 0 degrees. If the law
held for all temperatures, a
gas must shrink to zero vol-
ume at —273° C, which
would be an absolute zero.
This would be true, how-
ever, only if gases remained
gases as the temperature
decreased, and whether
this was so or not was not
known.

Chemical
Nomenclature

Language often stands in
the way of scientific ad-
vance. This was especially

true in chemistry, since
chemists had inherited
from the alchemists a be-
wildering array of names
for various substances. The
alchemists had deliberately
attempted to in e their
reputations by speaking
metaphorically and mysti-
cally, and since no two
used the same metaphors,
chemists could scarcely un-
derstand each other when
they reported their work.
Through the 1700s, at-
tempts had been made to
systematize the use of
chemical terms and names
for substances. Finally in
1787 Lavoisier (see 1769)
and several coworkers pub
