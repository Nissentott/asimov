Conservation of
Energy

Mayer } gested a law
of conservation of energy,
and Joule had collected the
data that made such a law
reasonable (see 1843). Both
lacked the necessary cre-
dentials as physicists to be
convincing.

In 1847, however, the
German physicist Hermann
Ludwig Ferdinand von
Helmholtz (1821-1894),
whose credentials were im-
peccable, gathered the nec-
essary data and published
his conclusion that the law
of conservation of energy
existed. In other words, the
total amount of energy in
the Universe was constant;
none could be created and
none could be destroyed.
Similarly, in any closed sys-
tem—any portion of the

   

ad sugg

 

 

Universe from which en-
ergy could not leave and
into which energy could
not enter—the total
amount of energy was con-
ant and could be neither
created nor destroyed. (To
be sure, no subsection of
the Universe can be per-
fectly isolated from all en-
ergy loss or gain.)

Naturally, although en-
ergy can be neither gained
nor lost, it can be converted
from one form to another.
Electricity, magnetism,
chemical energy, kinetic en-
ergy, light, sound, and heat
can all be interconverted.

The law of conserva-
tion of energy is also known
as the first law of thermody-
namics and it is usually
viewed as the most basic of
all the laws of nature.

Puerperal Fever

It had long been under-
stood that some diseases
were contagious, although
no one knew exactly what
caused the contagion.

In the case of puerperal
fever (from Latin words
meaning “childbearing,”
and more familiarly known
as childbed fever), there
were suspicious signs of a
certain type of contagion. A
woman giving birth who
was treated by a doctor

 

 

who was also treating other

child-bearing women was
much more likely to get the
disease than a woman
treated by a midwife who
was not treating anyone
else.

Some grew suspicious
that doctors were somehow
carrying the disease from
patient to patient. The pa-
tients, being in a weakened
