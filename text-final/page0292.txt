Polarized Light

Bartholin’s discovery that
Iceland spar showed double
refraction and produced
two rays of light (see 1669)
had never been properly ex-
plained.

In 1808 a French physi-
cist, Etienne-Louis Malus
(1775—1812), was playing
idly with a crystal of Ice-
land spar and found that

the sunlight reflected from
a window produced only a

single ray of light after pass-

ing through the crystal.
What's more, as he turned
the crystal, the ray of light
faded and the other one ap-
peared. When the crystal
was at right angles to its
original direction, only the
other ray of light appeared,
the first having disap-
peared.

Malus felt that light
might have different poles,
as magnets do, and that
one beam of light had its
poles at right angles to the
other. He therefore called
the rays polarized light, and
the name stuck even
though his theory was
wrong.

Polarized light turned
out to be enormously useful
to chemists.
