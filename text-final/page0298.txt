water to which a little bit
of sulfuric acid had been
added. If the starch had
been boiled in water with-
out the sulfuric acid, noth-
ing much would have
happened. With the sulfuric
acid, the starch was de-
stroyed, and in its place, a
substance was produced
that was freely soluble in
water and that tasted
sweet. It was a form of
sugar, and it was named
glucose, from the Greek
word for “sweet.”

Several discoveries
were made here. First, glu-
cose was studied for the
first time, and (as was even-
tually discovered) it is one
of the key substances of liv-
ing tissue. Second, it was
the first hint that starch
was built up of glucose
units and could be broken
down to glucose again.
Third, the sulfuric acid that
made the breakdown to glu-
cose possible was not itself
consumed in the reaction.

In later years, Berze-
lius (see 1803) gave the phe-
nomenon of participation-
without-being-consumed
the name of catalysis (from
Greek words meaning “'to
break down"). Sulfuric acid
was an example of a cata-
lyst that brought about the
breakdown of starch.

Catastrophism

Cuvier (see 1798) continued
to find important and inter-
esting fossils. In 1812 he re-
ported the fossil remains of
a creature that clearly must
have had wings and been
able to fly but whose skele-
ton showed it to have been
a reptile. It was named
pterodactyl, from Greek
words meaning “wing-fin-
ger,” because the mem-
brane of its wing was
stretched out along one
elongated finger.

Cuvier could see that
fossils represented crea-
tures that were extinct and
that the deeper the stratum
and the older the remains,
the less the fossils resem-
bled modern organisms.
Nevertheless, he couldn't
bring himself to accept the
idea of evolution.

Instead, in a book enti-
tled Inguiry into Fossil Re-
mains, published in 1812,
he advanced the notion
that there had been numer-
ous creations, each one
ended totally by some ca-
tastrophe and followed by a
new creation of life closer
to that of the present.

This view, called cata-
strophism, is usually consid-
ered the opposite of James
Hutton's uniformitarian-
ism, and for a long time the
two were considered mutu-
ally exclusive. However, it
is quite possible that
Earth’s history shows peri-

ods of uniformitarianism
interspersed by episodes of
catastrophism (though
none of the catastrophes, so
far, seem to have been com-
plete).

Cuvier was the first to
go into detail on the appear-
ances of ancient forms of
life, and he attempted to
classify them, as far as pos-
sible, by using the same sys-
tem used for living species.
In this way, he is consid-
ered to have founded pale-
ontology, the study of
ancient extinct forms of

life.

Universe as
Machine

In 1812 Laplace (see 1783)
suggested that if the mass,
position, and velocity of
every particle in the Uni-
verse were known, then the
entire past and future of
the Universe could be calcu-
lated.

In other words, he
viewed the Universe as a
vast automatic machine
that, once set in motion,
would follow an unswerv-
able path. On the one hand,
this would explain how
God, with supernatural
knowledge, could know all
the past and the future, but
on the other hand, it would
remove any need for God,
except to create the whole
thing and set it in motion.

This idea of a mecha-
