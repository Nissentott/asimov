large balls near the two
light balls, one on either
side. The force of gravity be-
tween the large balls and
light balls twisted the wire.
Cavendish measured the
twist and from that calcu-
lated the gravitational
force between the two ob-
jects, That gave him the
gravitational constant,
and that in turn gave him
the mass of the Earth.

The Earth turned out

to have a mass of
6,600,000,000,000,000,000,000
tons. Based on the known
volume of the Earth, this
made the average density
of the Earth five and a half
times that of water.

So precise was Caven-
dish’s experiment that this
first-time calculation was
very close to the value ac-
cepted today.

Comparative
Anatomy

The greatest anatomist of
his day was a Frenchman,
Georges Cuvier (1769—
1832). In a book published
in 1798, he studied the anat-
omy of various animals to
show how they compared
with one another and did
so with such excellence
that he is considered the
founder of comparative
anatomy.

 

He introduced a new
broad classification into the
taxonomic scheme of Lin-
naeus (see 1735). Lin-
naeus’s broadest division
was that of class, but Cu-
vier grouped various
classes into phyla (singular
phylum, from a Greek word
for “tribe").

Cuvier's eye for detail
was such that he could tell
whether fossil remains rep-
resented animals that be-
longed to one or another of
the known phyla even
though they were not mem-
bers of any living species.

Everything he discov-
ered seemed to imply the
existence of biological evo-
lution, but Cuvier remained
frmly in the antievolution
camp.

Population
Pressure

It seems obvious that popu-
lation increases in times of
peace, health, and prosper-
ity and declines as a result
of war, disease, and famine,
but the first to try to ana-
lyze the matter dispassion-
ately was a British
economist, Thomas Robert
Malthus (1766—1834). In
1798 he published a book,
Essay on Population, in
which he pointed out that
population tended to in-
crease in geometric progres-

sion (2,4, 8, 16 .. ) while
the food supply tended to
increase in arithmetic pro-
gression (2,3,4,5...).As
a result, population would
always outstrip the food
supply no matter what
happened, and the surplus
number of people would
have to be stripped away
by famine, war, and dis-
ease.

This imparted a certain
inevitability to disaster and
misery, which could only
be removed by lowering the
birthrate. In a second edi-
tion, Malthus suggested de-
layed marriage and sexual
continence as a way of
bringing this about. It
doesn’t take much of a
cynic to realize that in the
long run this won't work,
but any suggestion that
there are ways of lowering
the birthrate without de-
priving people of the plea-
sures of sex is always met
with strong disapproval
on the part of the blue-
nosed.

Malthus did not grasp
the role technological ad-
vance could play in ward-
ing off disaster, even
though he wrote at a time
when the Industrial Revolu-
tion was in its early stages.
Because of such advances,
the world population is
now five times what it was
in Malthus's day and the
Malthusian consequence
has not yet been paid. But
