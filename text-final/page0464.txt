charge that was oscillat-
ing and therefore produc-
ing it?

Arrhenius had main-
tained that atoms or groups
of atoms could carry elec-
tric charges (see 1884), and
Lorentz (see 1895) had won-
dered if it might be electric
charges within the atom
that did the oscillating. If
that were the case, then
placing a light source
under the influence of a
strong magnetic field ought
to affect the oscillating
charges and introduce
changes in the spectral
lines.

Lorentz had a student,
the Dutch physicist Pieter
Zeeman (1865-1943), who
undertook the experiment,
and indeed, the magnetic
field split the spectral lines
into three components.
This Zeeman effect could be
used to study the fine de-
tails of atomic structure
and to yield information on
the structure of stars as
well.

As a result, Lorentz
and Zeeman shared the
Nobel Prize in physics in
1902.

Ferments and
Enzymes

Kuhne had suggested that
the term ferments be re-
stricted to catalysts within
living cells while those that

 

could be isolated as nonliv-
ing molecules be consid-
ered enzymes (see 1878).

In 1896 a German
chemist, Eduard Buchner
(1860-1917), wondered if
the enzymes in yeast would
work if they were extracted
from the living cell.

To do this, he ground
up yeast cells with sand
until not one of them was
left alive. He then filtered
the material, obtaining a
clear, cell-free liquid. He
added sugar to preserve it
against bacterial contami-
nation and found that be-
fore long carbon dioxide
was forming vigorously.
The clear extract from the
yeast was doing the job of
fermenting sugar just as
the intact cells would have,
and Buchner had demon-
strated the opposite of
what he had expected.

From this point on, the
term enzymes was applied
to all biochemical cata-
lysts, in or out of a cell, and
another bastion of vitalism
had fallen.

For this work, Buchner
was awarded the Nobel
Prize in chemistry in 1907.

Acoustics

In 1896 an American physi-
cist, Wallace Clement Ware
Sabine (1868-1919), com-
pleted the study of a new
lecture room that had been
built at Harvard University

the previous year. The lec-
ture room had a flaw; the
lecturer could not be heard
because of excessive rever-
beration. Sabine had inves-
tigated every angle of the
problem, even photo-
graphing sound waves that
were made visible by the
changes in light refraction
they produced.

As a result of his stud-
ies, Sabine founded the sci-
ence of architectural
acoustics. In the process he
showed how to design a
hall that would make the
sounds of voice and music
clear. For the purpose, he
made use of mathematical
equations that related ab-
sorptivity of sound by vari-
ous materials and the
volume of the room to the
amount of reverberation.
