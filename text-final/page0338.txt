These distances made
the Universe suddenly
much larger than astrono-
mers till then had dreamed.
The entire Solar System
shrank to a dot in space in
comparison to the distance
of even the nearest stars.

Cell Theory

Hooke had first seen the
empty remains of cells in
cork (see 1665). Since then,
biologists had often seen
cells in living tissue, seen
them as small bodies
marked off and enclosed by
cell membranes in animals,
and by thin, cellulose-con-
taining cell walls in plants.
Brown had even seen the
nuclei within cells (see
1831).

In 1838 the German
botanist Matthias Jakob
Schleiden (1804—1881)
made the necessary leap of
understanding and an-
nounced that all living
plant tissue was made up of
cells. The next year,
Schwann (see 1836) ex-
tended the notion to ani-
mals as well. Both
Schleiden and Schwann
felt that the cell nuclei
were of importance in con-
nection with cell reproduc-
tion but could not divine
the details. Those details
were not to be worked out
for another forty years.

The Schleiden-

Schwann cell theory helped
scientists enormously in en-
larging their understanding
of life.

Yeast Cells

The discovery of substances
such as diastase (see 1833)
and pepsin (see 1836),
which were organic cata-
lysts but nonliving, turned
the attention of chemists to
yeast. Some thought that
yeast might not be alive ei-
ther, but it was indisput-
able that yeast actually
grew in quantity as it was
used, and that was charac-
teristic of life.

Finally, in 1838, a
French engineer, Charles
Cagniard de la Tour (1777—
1859), settled the matter.
He studied yeast under the
microscope and actually
saw some of the globules
budding and forming new
globules. He realized he
had been watching yeast
cells, and that they were liv-
ing things.

Protein

1t sometimes happens that
the chief contribution of a
particular scientist is the in-
vention of an important
word. Thus the Dutch
chemist Gerardus Johannes
Mulder (1802—1880)
worked on the chemical
structure of albuminous

substances, which seemed
to consist of molecules
more complex than those of
carbohydrates or fats. He
came to believe that such
substances were made up
of a basic building block of
carbon, hydrogen, oxygen,
and nitrogen, to which
were added varying num-
bers of sulfur and phospho-
rus atoms.

In 1838 he gave this
basic building block the
name protein, from the
Greek word for “first,”
since it seemed the founda-
tion of substances that were
of first importance to living
tissue. Eventually the word
came to be used for the sub-
stances generally, and to
this day, protein is what we
call one of the two types of
substances that are indeed
of first importance to living
tissue.

Morse Code

The idea of a telegraph had
occurred to a number of
people, including Henry
(see 1823) and the British
inventor Charles
Wheatstone (1802—1875). It
was just a matter of setting
up a long wire and sending
electricity through it in
pulses by opening and clos-
ing a key. Combinations of
pulses could be interpreted
as letters and words.
