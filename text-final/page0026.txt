of an Egyptian word mean-
ing “big house.” (This is
similar to our present habit
of saying “the White
House” when we mean the
president.)

It was customary for
the important citizens of
the nation to build them-
selves elaborate burial
tombs, since Egyptian reli-
gion dealt in detail with life
after death, and it was felt
that, to insure immortality,
the body had to be pre-
served. The tombs were
oblong objects called
mastabas. (Nowadays, to
insure the immortality of
our presidents, we build co-
lossal presidential librar-
ies.)

In about 2686 B.c.,
when Djoser, the second
king of the Third Dynasty
came to power, he decided
to build a particularly elab-
orate tomb as a memorial
to his greatness. He had a
counselor named Imhotep
who supervised the build-
ing of six mastabas of
stone, one on top of the
other, each smaller than
the one below. The result
was basically pyramidal in
shape, but it was set back

periodically as modern sky-
scrapers sometimes are. Be-
cause these setbacks were
like steps a giant would use
in climbing to the top, the
structure is called the Step
Pyramid. The base is an ob-
long about 400 feet by 350
feet, and the top is almost
200 feet high.

The Step Pyramid was
the first large stone struc-
ture ever built and is the
oldest structure built by hu-
mans that remains substan-
tially intact today.

The Step Pyramid set a
fashion, and for a couple of
centuries afterward the
pharaohs kept the people
busy in their spare time
building more and more
elaborate pyramids. Larger
and larger stones were
used, and the climax came
when the Pharaoh Khufu
(Cheops to the Greeks) su-
pervised construction of the
Great Pyramid, the largest
of all, in about 2530 B.c.

When that pyramid
was finished, its square
base was 755 feet on each
side, so that it covered an
area of 13 acres. The four
sides sloped upward evenly
(for the notion of steps had

been abandoned) to a point
481 feet high. It was solidly
composed of slabs of rock—
2,300,000 of them, it is esti-
mated, with an average
weight of 2'4 tons apiece.
Each had to be brought
some 600 miles, by water,
of course, from quarries far
up the Nile.

In among these rocky
slabs were passages leading
to a chamber near the cen-
ter of the huge pile, which
was to contain the king'’s
coffin, his mummy, and
his treasures after his
death.

The fad for such large,
vainglorious structures did
not persist for long. They
took too much time and too
much work even for Egypt.
The urge to build big ob-
jects, some useful, some
symbolic, some vainglori-
ous, has never left human-
ity, however. Some of the
medieval cathedrals finally
surpassed the pyramids in
height (after 3,500 years or
so) and today, of course, we
have our skyscrapers, our
huge bridges and dams,
and so on.
