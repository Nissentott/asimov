Fermi-Dirac
Statistics

Bose and Einstein had
worked out the Bose-
Einstein statistics a year
earlier, but the statistics
now turned out to hold only
for those particles (like the
photon) that had spins of in-
tegral values: 0, 1, 2, and so
on. Particles like the proton
and electron had spins of
half-values: 2, 1'%, and so
on.

Once Pauli had worked
out the exclusion principle
(see 1925) for particles with
half-value spins, it was
clear that Bose-Einstein
wouldn’t work for particles
with such spins. A new set
of statistics would there-
fore have to be worked
out.

Taking the lead in
working out that problem,
in 1926, was an Italian
physicist, Enrico Fermi
(1901—1954). Dirac (see
1930) also contributed, so
that the result is known as
the Fermi-Dirac statistics.
All particles subject to
these statistics, like the
proton and electron, are
called fermions in honor
of Fermi.

Galactic
Rotation

Twenty-two years before,
Kapteyn had observed that
there were two star streams
moving in opposite direc-
tions (see 1904). In 1926 the
Swedish astronomer Bertil
Lindblad (1895-1965), ana-
lyzing these motions care-
fully, showed that they
were just what would be ex-
pected if we viewed the Gal-
axy as rotating about its
center.

Shortly thereafter, the
Dutch astronomer Jan Hen-
drik Oort (b. 1900) came to
the same conclusion.

Liquid-Fuel
Rockets

The Chinese had made use
of rockets in the Middle
Ages, and Isaac Newton,
with his law of action and
reaction (see 1687), had
shown that rockets were
one way of traveling
through outer space. Until
the twentieth century, how-
ever, rockets had made use
of gunpowder as the fuel
and had depended on the at-
mosphere for oxygen.

A crucial change was
introduced by the Ameri-
can physicist Robert Hutch-
ings Goddard (1882-1945).
He had been interested in

rocketry since his teens,
and it occurred to him that
a rocket would be more
powerful and under better
control if it made use of a
liquid fuel such as gasoline
and carried its own oxi-
dizer in the form of liquid
oxygen.

On March 16, 1926,
Goddard fired his first
liquid-fuel rocket. It was
about 4 feet high, 6 inches
in diameter, and was held
in a frame like a child’s jun-
gle gym. It rose 200 feet
into the air. It didn’t seem
like much, but that little
rocket marked the first step
in the expansion of the
human range beyond the at-
mosphere.

Enzyme
Crystallization

Although Payen had iso-
lated an enzyme for the
first time nearly a century
before (see 1833), scientists
still didn’t understand the
chemical nature of en-
zymes.

From the fact that en-
zyme action could be de-
stroyed by gentle heating,
it might be supposed that
enzymes were proteins.
However, Willstatter (see
1906) had purified enzyme
solutions as far as he could
while still retaining the en-
zyme action and had then
