Diderot caught fire and
made a huge project out of
it. He used collaborators
but in the end did most of
the work alone. The first
volume appeared in 1751.

Diderot's product was
the first modern encyclope-
dia. It took a completely ra-
tional view of the world
and clearly opposed the
shibboleths of state and

church at that time. It im-
pressed intellectuals as the
supreme product of the Age
of Reason.

Lightning Rod

The Leyden jar (see 1745)
had become a favorite play-
thing of many scientists.
One of them was Benjamin
Franklin.

In 1747 Franklin re-
jected du Fay's notion of
two electrical fluids (see
1733). He thought there
was only one, which could
exist in an excess (above
normal) or in a deficiency
(below normal). Excess re-
pelled excess, since neither
could accept the otherâ€™s.
Similarly, deficiency re-
pelled deficiency, since nei-
ther could offer anything to
the other. Excess, however,
attracted deficiency, and
the electrical fluid poured
from the excess to the defi-
ciency, neutralizing both

and leaving each un-
charged.

Franklin suggested that
the excess be called positive
electricity and the defi-
ciency negative electricity.
There was no telling which
variety of electricity, vitre-
ous or resinous, was posi-
tive and which negative.
Franklin guessed arbi-
trarily and happened to
guess wrong. That makes
no difference, however. The
names can be used and the
literal meanings forgotten.

Franklin noted the
manner of discharge of the
Leyden jar. When the elec-
trical charge was drawn
off, it emitted a spark of
light and a erackle of
sound. Franklin was struck
by the similarity to a tiny
lightning stroke and an

equally tiny crack of thun-
der. He at once reversed the
thought. During a thunder-
storm, did Earth and sky
set up a gigantic Leyden
jar, and was the lightning
and thunder an equally gi-
gantic discharge?

He decided to experi-
ment. In 1751, he flew a
kite in a thunderstorm. The
kite carried a metal point
to which a long silk thread
was attached. At the bot-
tom of the thread, near
Franklin (who held onto the
silk by way of a second i
thread that remained dry), 4
was a metal key. As the
thunderclouds gathered
and the silk thread began to
show signs of electrical
charge (the separate fibers :
repelled each other), Frank- -
lin put his knuckle near the
