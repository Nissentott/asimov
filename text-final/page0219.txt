each half could grow into a
complete organism, and if
two hydra were grafted to-

single individual. This
showed that such proper-
ties, thought to be exclusive
to plants, clearly existed in

  

animals, loo, if the animals
were sufficiently primitive

Celsius Scale

For nearly thirty years, the
Fahrenheit scale (see 1714)
had been commonly used
for temperature measure-
ments. It had some disad-
vantages, however. For
instance, the freezing point
of water was set at 32 de-
grees, a curiously uneven
number.

It makes a huge differ-
ence, both to scientists and
to human beings generally,
whether water is liquid or
solid, whether a pond is fro-
zen over or not, whether it
snows or rains. In 1742,
therefore, the Swedish as-
tronomer Anders Celsius
(1701-1744) suggested that
the freezing point of water
be set at 0 degrees, so that a
positive reading meant
water and a negative read-

ing meant ice. The boiling
point of water would then
be set at 100 degrees,
rather than 212.

This new scale was at
first called the Centigrade
scale (from Latin words
meaning “‘a hundred steps”
—that is, from the freezing
point to the boiling point of
water), but this was con-
verted to Celsius scale by in-
ternational agreement in
1948. The entire world has
now adopted the Celsius
scale with only one signifi-
cant exception—the United
States.

Goldbach’s
Conjecture

A mathematician who
lhinks some statement
seemns true but can't prove

it’s true may then advance
it as a conjecture. Fermat'’s
Last Theorem (see 1637) is
not a conjecture; Fermat
stated flatly that he had a
proof—though he may have
been mistaken, to be sure.

The most famous ac-
tual conjecture is one made
by a German mathemati-
cian who worked in Russia,
Christian Goldbach (1690—
1764).

To explain it, we begin
by saying that a prime num-
ber is any number greater
than 1 that can only be di-
vided by itself and 1. There
are an infinite number of
primes. The first few are
2,3,5,7,11, 13, 17; 19;
and 23.

It seemed to Goldbach
that any even number
greater than 2 could be ex-
pressed as the sum of two
