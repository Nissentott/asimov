Intelligence
Quotient

While abnormal psycholog-
ical phenomena have long
interested physicians and
scientists, the normal mani-
festations of the mind were
what interested the French
psychologist Alfred Binet
(1857—1911).

He strove to devise

tests that would measure
the ability of the human
mind to think and reason,
independently of learning
and education in one field
or another.

To do this, he asked
children to name objects,
follow commands, re-
arrange disordered things,
copy designs, and so on. In
1905 he and his associates
published the first batteries
of tests designed to mea-
sure intelligence.

Standards were set em-
pirically. If a particular test
was passed by some 70 per-
cent or so of the nine-year-
olds in the Paris school sys-
tem, then it represented the

nine-year-old level of intel-
ligence.

The phrase intelligence
quotient (often abbreviated
1Q) became popular. It rep-
resents the ratio of the men-
tal age to the chronological
age, with 100 considered av-
erage. Thus, a six-year-old
who can pass a ten-year-
old’s test has an IQ of 10/6
X 100, or 167.

Binet's initial efforts
gave rise to batteries of
tests designed to measure
personalities, attitudes, ap-
titudes, and potentialities
as well as intelligence—
and their value is almost
certainly overestimated.
