chance of guessing cor-
rectly, and (unlike Franklin
on the electric charge—see
1752), he guessed right. The
natural sugars all happen
to belong to the D-series.
While engaged in this
work, Fischer also studied a
group of substances called
purines, with molecules
that consisted of a double
ring of atoms made up of
five carbons and four nitro-
gens. They were eventually
found to make up an im-
portant part of certain key
biochemical substances.
For his work on sugar
structure and on purines,
Fischer received the Nobel
Prize for chemistry in 1902.

Cocaine

Cocaine is an alkaloid ob-
tained from the leaves of
the coca bush, which origi-
nally grew wild in Peru and
Bolivia. The Incas chewed
the leaves to suppress feel-
ings of pain and weariness
and so be able to endure
the strains of life better.
Europeans eventually
discovered cocaine without
understanding at first that
it was strongly addictive
and therefore dangerous.
One of the first to study it
was an Austrian physician,
Sigmund Freud (1856—
1939). He did not follow it
up but passed on his infor-
mation to an Austrian col-
league, Carl Koller (1857—

1944). Freud suggested that
cocaine might be a pain-
relieving agent, but Koller
went further and studied
its uses as a local anesthe-
tic (one that would deaden
pain in a particular area of
the body without produc-
ing unconsciousness).

In 1884, after having
experimented on animals,
Koller performed an eye
operation on a patient—the
first using local anesthesia.
It was successful. Eventu-
ally, local anesthetics were
developed that were more
effective, and safer, than
cocaine.

Bacterial
Staining

Bacteria can be stained
with synthetic dyes, just as
Flemming had shown that
ordinary cells can be (see
1882).

In 1884 a Danish bacte-
riologist, Hans Christian
Joachim Gram (1853-
1938), stained bacteria with
a dye. He found that, when
treated with iodine and an
alcohol wash, the stain
could be removed from
some kinds of bacteria but
not from others.

The bacteria that re-
tained the dye were called
Gram-positive, while those
that lost it were Gram-nega-
tive. The importance of this
became apparent once anti-

bacterial agents were devel-
oped and it was found that
some attacked the Gram-
positive varieties and some
the Gram-negative ones.

Steam Turbine

Turbines had been devised
(see 1827), but none were
capable of withstanding the
high temperatures to which
they would be subjected if
they were to be turned by
jets of steam and of with-
standing the simultaneous
stress of rapid rotation
while preventing steam
from escaping prematurely.

In 1884, however, the
British engineer Charles Al-
gernon Parsons (1854—
1931) constructed the first
successful steam turbine.
Such devices could be used
to power ships, which
could then attain unusually
high speeds. They could
also be used in electric gen-
erators.

Linotype

Ever since the invention of

_printing (see 1454), ad-

vances had been made in
the speed with which it
could be carried through.
The greater the speed, the
more printed matter would
be produced, the more
would be read, and the
more would be desired, es-
pecially as literacy in-
creased the world over.
