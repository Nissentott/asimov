Latent Heat

Black (see 1754) found in
1762 that if a mixture of ice
and water was heated, the
heat was absorbed but the
temperature did not
change. All the heat went
toward melting the ice into
water, the water being at
the same temperature as

ice but containing more
heat. The same happened
to an even greater extent
when water was boiled into
vapor.

Black called this latent
heat (from a Latin word for
“hidden’), since the heat
was there but did not make
itself apparent in the form
of temperature. The latent

heat was not lost, of course,
for when water vapor was
condensed to water, or
water was frozen to ice, the
latent heat was given off
again.

An understanding of la-
tent heat was important in
the improvement of the
steam engine a few years
later.

 

1763

 

Pollination

The existence of sexuality
in plants must have seemed
strange, since plants, being
essentially immobile, can-
not indulge in the kind of
sex that animals do.

In 1763, however, a
German botanist, Josef
Gottlieb Kohlreuter (1733

1806), pointed out the man-
ner in which plant pollen
can be blown by the wind
to reach female organs in a
purely random manner. Be-
cause of this randomness,
plants that depend on wind
pollination must produce
pollen in vast amounts.

He also pointed out
that a more efficient pro-

cess is to have bees or other
similar animals do the job.
A bee enters a flower in
search of nectar (the bribe
to make it enter). Pollen
coats the bee's fuzzy cov-
ering, and when the bee vis-
its the next flower, that
pollen rubs off on the pistil.
