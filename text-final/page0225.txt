volume of his Natural His-
tory, he suggested that
Earth (and presumably the
other planets) had been
formed by the collision of
the Sun with another mas-
sive body (which he called
a comet).

Buffon then tried to de-
cide how old the Earth was
by calculating how many
years it would take an ob-

ject the size of the Earth to
cool from the temperature
of the Sun to the tempera-
ture of the Earth today.
This, he eventually an-
nounced, could be as much
as 75,000 years; Earth had
grown cool enough to sup-
port life about 40,000 years
before, and it would exist
for another 90,000 years be-
fore becoming too cold

to support lite any
longer.

To be sure, Buffon'’s es-
timates of these values
were much smaller than
the time periods scientists
were to accept later on, but
he was the first important
scientist to suggest that the
Earth might be much older
than the 6,000 years allot-
ted it by Ussher (see 1650).

Nickel

Although Brandt had iso-
lated cobalt fourteen years
before (see 1737), the prob-
lem of copper ore that did
not yield copper persisted.
Some of this sort of ore
didn’t yield cobalt, either,
and the miners called it
kupfernickel (Old Nick's cop-
per, with reference to the
devil).

In 1751 a Swedish min-
eralogist, Axel Fredrick
Cronstedt (1722—1765),
who had studied under
Brandt, tackled kupfer-
nickel and isolated from it
a white metal that was nei-
ther copper nor cobalt.
Cronstedt called it nickel,

taking the second half of
the miners’ name.

Cronstedt discovered
that nickel, like iron but
less strongly, was attracted
by a magnet. It was the
first time that anything but
iron had been found to be
attracted by a magnet. As a
matter of fact, magnets
were eventually found to at-
tract cobalt as well.

Indeed, iron, cobalt,
and nickel are very similar
metals. This was the first
hint that elements might be
grouped into families and
that some sort of order
might be imposed on
them—but that did not
take place for another
century.

 

Encyclopedias

The growing accumulation
of knowledge and the grow-
ing self-confidence of the
scientists of this period
(which called itself the Age
of Reason) made it natural
to think of preparing a mul-
tivelume summary of all
knowledge for the general
public, under headings ar-
ranged in alphabetical
order. This would be an en-
cyclopedia, from Greek
words meaning “general ed-
ucation.”

A rather modest sugges-
tion to this effect was made
by a bookseller to a prolific
French free-lance writer,
Denis Diderot (1713—1784)
