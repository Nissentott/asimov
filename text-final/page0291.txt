Sodium and
Potassium

By this time, some thirty-
eight substances were
known that are today recog-
nized as elements; most of
them being metals. There
were some substances that
were known to be oxides—
combinations of oxygen
with a metal—but the com-
bination could not be bro-
ken up and the free metal
could not be isolated. None
of the ordinary chemical
methods used to isolate
other metals would work.

It was known, however,
that an electric current
would break up water mole-
cules into hydrogen and ox-
ygen when more customary
chemical methods failed
(see 1800). An electric cur-
rent might do the same for
the recalcitrant oxides.

Davy (see 1800, Nitrous
Oxide) grew interested in
the problem and con-

structed a battery with
over two hundred and fifty
metallic plates, the strong-
est ever built to that time.
On October 6, 1807, he
passed an electric current
through molten potassium
carbonate and liberated a
metal, which he called pot-
assium. The little globules
of shining metal, when
added to water, tore the
water molecule apart as the
metal eagerly recombined
with oxygen, and the liber-
ated hydrogen was heated
to the point where it burst
into flame. A week later, he
isolated metallic sodium
from sodium carbonate.
The next year, by simi-
lar methods, Davy isolated
the elements barium, stron-
tium, calcivm, and magne-
sium. All were active
elements that held on to ox-
ygen tightly and would not
have been isolated easily by
non-electric techniques.
These discoveries ex-
cited the scientific world

enormously and greatly
stimulated research into
electrochemistry.

Steamboat

Since Fitch’s failure to
make his steamboat suc-
ceed (see 1787), the notion
had not been taken up
again. But then the Ameri-
can inventor Robert Fulton
(1765-1815) tackled the
project, In 1807 he built the
Clermont, 133 feet long.
This vessel performed well,
steaming up the Hudson
from New York to Albany
in 32 hours, maintaining an
average speed of nearly 5
miles per hour. Soon he
had a fleet of steamboats in
operation, and unlike Fitch,
he was commercially suc-
cessful. For this reason, Ful-
ton is usually considered
the inventor of the steam-
boat,
