 

Science in the Ancient World
(3500 B.C.—A.D. 475)

 

While other Middle Eastern
cultures were major powers
in the ancient world, Egypt
was the first nation. Begin-
ning in 3100 B.C., city-
states along 500 miles of
the River Nile shared a
common language and cul-
ture. Around the same
time, the first European civ-
ilization developed on the
island of Crete. By 2500
B.C., Chinese civilization
arose along the Yellow
River, and agriculture
began to develop in Central
America. The science and
technology of these early
times was initially practi-
cal—metallurgy for tools
and weapons; astronomy
for telling time and know-
ing when to plant and har-
vest; mathematics and
geometry for measurement,
navigation, and architec-
ture. A quantum leap in
communications was made
around 1500 B.c., when
Phoenician traders created
the alphabet—symbols
used not for ideas but for
the sounds that make up
words. This revolutionary
method made writing and
reading much easier. Be-
fore the ascendancy of the
Greeks, the Phoenicians

were the supreme seafar-
ers of the Mediterranean—
and beyond. By 1100 B.c.,
they were using star con-
stellations to guide their
oar-powered ships into ter-
ritories in the western
Mediterranean and be-
yond. The greatest scien-
tific contribution of the
Greeks, whose culture
began to flourish around
800 B.c., was their ap-
proach. In their search for
general principles that
would describe how the
world worked, they
evolved theories based on
what they could prove. Un-
like the great cultures that
had preceded them, the
Greeks separated science
from religion and supersti-
tion. Their astronomical in-
vestigations yielded results
that far surpassed earlier
knowledge, and they were
the first to consider mathe-
matics apart from the prac-
ticalities of calculation

and measurement, devel-
oping over a period of
eight hundred years meth-
ods of reasoning in geome-
try and algebra that form
the basis for modern math-
ematics. Practical appli-
cations were not, of

course, ignored. For
example, among the nu-
merous discoveries and in-
novations of Archimedes
were an explanation of the
principle of buoyancy and
the theory of how levers
work. Besides laying out
the system of rational
thought we call logic, Aris-
totle is recognized as the
father of the life sciences.
He examined and classi-
fied more than five hun-
dred species of animals,
and his student Theophras-
tus did the same for a simi-
lar number of plant
species. The Greek physi-
cian Hippocrates is called
the father of medicine be-
cause, in the fifth century
B.C., he rejected the idea
that illness was a result of
supernatural intervention.
Greek physicians were the
first to dissect the human
body, beginning about 500
B.c. By 100 B.c., Greece
had declined and Rome
was supreme in the Medi-
terranean world. The
Romans were not innova-
tors, but they did find
practical uses for Greek
knowledge—especially in
engineering and construe-
tion—and as the Roman
