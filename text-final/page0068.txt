Earth’s Zones

Anyone who traveled was
bound to find that the cli-
mate was different in differ-
ent places. In the north
European forest, it was
colder than it was in
Greece, with longer, snow-
ier winters. In Egypt it was
warmer than in Greece,
and cold weather was rare.

The idea was formal-
ized by the Roman geogra-
pher Pomponius Mela (1st
century A.p.) about A.p. 25.
(From now on, any dates
not marked B.c. will be o.p.)
Pomponius Mela, accepting
a spherical Earth, sug-
gested that it be divided
into a North Frigid Zone
and a South Frigid Zone in
the neighborhood of the

poles, a Torrid Zone in the
neighborhood of the Equa-
tor, and a North Temperate
Zone and a South Temper-
ate Zone in between. This
notion still holds today,
even though variations in
climate are far more com-
plicated than would be
thought from a consider-
ation of zones alone.

Pharmacology

The Greek physician Peda-
nius Dioscorides (ca. 40—ca.
90) served in the Roman ar-
mies and had an opportu-
nity to study the plant life
in large parts of the Medi-
terranean world. He was in-
terested chiefly in the
medical applications of
plants, and in his book De
Materia Medica, he de-
scribed about six hundred

 

plants and nearly a thou-
sand drugs. This was the
first important work on
pharmacology (from Greek
words meaning “the study
of drugs”).

Steam Power

Although Alexandria was
now Roman and well past
its great days, the Museum
and the Library still ex-

isted, and a Greek engineer,

Hero (1st century), worked
there at about this time.
Hero constructed a hollow
sphere to which two bent
tubes were attached, the
openings pointing in oppo-
site directions. When water
was boiled in the sphere,
the steam escaped through
the tubes and, as a result of
what we now call the law
of action and reaction,
caused the sphere to rotate
rapidly. (The modern lawn
