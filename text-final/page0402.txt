groups of cells, different

from the cells in the body of

the gland. These groups
came to be called the islets
of Langerhans.

At the time, they may
have seemed a detail of no
great importance beyond
making it possible to gain a
degree, but the time was to
come when they proved of
enormous value.

Celluloid

Something is plastic if it is
capable of being molded or
shaped with relative ease.
In that sense, clay, plaster,
wood, rubber, and glass are
all plastic. However, the
noun plastic these days has
come to be applied to a
group of synthetic organic
substances that posses

 

plastic properties. The first
of these was pyroxylin, pre-
pared by Parkes seventeen
years earlier (see 1855).
Pyroxylin had no com-
mercial use at the time.

Then a prize of ten thou-
sand dollars (a fortune in
those days) was offered for
a substance cheaper than
ivory but just as good, for
the manufacture of billiard
balls.

An American inventor,
John Wesley Hyatt (1837-
1920), wanted the prize
money and had heard of py-
roxylin. Hyatt improved on
Parkesâ€™s method of prepar-
ing it and in 1869 patented
his method of manufactur-
ing billiard balls out of this
material, which he named
celluloid.

He did not win the
prize, but celluloid enjoyed
a minor boom as a material
for baby rattles, shirt col-
lars, photographic film, and
other products. It was light,
flexible, waterproof, and
zasily cleaned. Its one great
flaw was that it was flam-
mable. Celluloid was the
first commercially success-
ful plastic.

 

Stock Ticker

In 1869 an American teleg-
rapher, Thomas Alva Edi-
son (1847-1931), came to
New York seeking employ-
ment. While he was in a
broker's office waiting to be
interviewed, a telegraph
machine transmitting gold
prices broke down. Edison
was the only one present
who saw how to fix it.

He went on to devise
something better, and in-
vented a stock ticker of a
type that was used for
many decades. This he pro-
ceeded to sell to a large
Wall Street firm. He
wanted to ask five thousand
dollars but lost his courage
and asked the president to
make him an offer. The
president offered forty thou-
sand.

That launched Edison
on his career as probably
the greatest inventor the
world has ever seen.
