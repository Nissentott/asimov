an asteroid with an un-
usual orbit a masculine
name, he followed the prec-
edent of Witt (see 1898).

Other asteroids were
eventually discovered that
accompanied Achilles in its
triangular position, and
still others at a point 60 de-
grees from Jupiter in the
other direction, so that
there were two equilateral
triangles adjacent to each
other. All were named after
various heroes of the Tro-
jan War, so that they could
be lumped together as the
Trojan asteroids. The posi-
tion at the third apex of a
triangle where the other
two are occupied by larger
bodies is now called the Tro-
jan position.

Alpha Particles

By now it was understood
that beta rays were streams
of speeding electrons (beta
particles), while gamma
rays were electromagnetic
radiation of still shorter
wavelength and higher fre-
quency than X rays, The na-
ture of the alpha particles
that made up the alpha
rays remained to be deter-
mined.

In 1906 Rutherford (see
1897), working with a Ger-
man assistant, Johannes
Hans Wilhelm Geiger
(1882—1945), managed to
determine the ratio of the
electric charge to the mass

 

in the case of the alpha par-
ticles. This ratio turned out
to be equal to that in a he-
lium atom from which two
electrons had been re-
moved.

Later Rutherford fired
alpha particles at a double
wall of glass with a vacuum
between. The alpha parti-
cles had energy enough to
penetrate the first partition
but, in the process of pene-
tration, lost so much en-
ergy that they were unable
to penetrate the second.
They therefore remained in
the vacuum between, and
after enough had accumu-
lated, Rutherford found
that the thin gas that had
appeared in the vacuum
was indeed helium, judging
from the spectrum.

Alpha particles and
helium were thus related,
but not identical. After
all, streams of helium
atoms would not pene-
trate glass.

Characteristic
X Rays

X rays had been discovered
eleven years earlier and
were still of profound inter-
est to physicists. The Brit-
ish physicist Charles Glover
Barkla (1877—-1944) studied
the manner in which X rays
were scattered by gases and
found that the higher the
molecular weight of the
gas, the greater the scatter-

ing of the X rays. From this
he deduced, in 1904, that
the more massive the
atoms and molecules, the
more charged particles
they contained, since it was
the charged particles that
did the scattering. This was
the first indication of a con-
nection between the num-
ber of charged particles in
an atom and its position in
the periodic table.

He further showed,
from the manner of scatter-
ing, that X rays were trans-
verse waves like light, not
longitudinal waves like
sound, This was the final
proof that they were exam-
ples of electromagnetic ra-
diation.

In 1906 Barkla went on
to something still more im-
portant. He showed that
when X rays were scattered
by particular elements,
they produced a beam with
a particular degree of pene-
tration. The higher the
atomic weight of an ele-
ment, the more penetrating
the characteristic X rays
they produced. He went on
to describe two types of
such X rays: the more pene-
trating he called K radia-
tion and the less
penetrating he called L radi-
ation.

At the time it was diffi-
cult to know what to make
of this, but before long,
characteristic X rays were
to be important in rational-
izing the periodic table.
