The Jacquard looms
spread rapidly throughout
France and eventually
through Great Britain as
well. The holes in the card
were a primitive kind of
yes-no mechanism; a cen-
tury and a half later a
much more subtle type of
yes-no mechanism would
serve as the basis for digital
computers.

Ceres

The German astronomer Jo-
hann Daniel Tietz, in Latin
Titius (1729-1796), had
suggested in 1766 that it
was possible to work up a
simple arithmetical series
that would give the rela-
tionship of the distance of
the various planets from
the Sun. Six years later, the
German astronomer Jo-
hann Elert Bode (1747—
1826) popularized that se-
ries, which came to be
known as Bode's law.
Bode's law didn’t seem
to have much scientific sig-
nificance. Still, when Ura-
nus was discovered (see
1781), it turned out to be
just where Bode's law pre-
dicted a planet would be.
That rather impressed as-
tronomers. It so happened
that Bode's law also pre-
dicted that a planet ought
to exist in the space be-
tween Mars and Jupiter,
but no such planet was
known. It might be that it

 

was a small one and had
gone unnoticed.

For that reason, an-
other German astronomer,
Heinrich Wilhelm Mat-
thaus Olbers (1758—1840),
began to organize a group
that would take different
portions of the sky and
search them for any mov-
ing object that might be
that planet.

While the preparations
were under way, an Italian
astronomer, Giuseppe
Piazzi (1746—1826), who
wasn't looking for the
planet, came across it while
he was working at an obser-
vatory in Sicily. It was a
dim object, not quite visi-
ble to the unaided eye, that
changed position from
night to night. The discov-
ery was made on January 1,
1801, the first day of the
nineteenth century.

Piazzi began to follow
its course. Since it moved
more rapidly than Jupiter
and more slowly than
Mars, its orbit must lie be-
tween the orbits of those
two long-known planets.
Since it was much dimmer
than either of those planets,
it must be far smaller, too,
and we now know that it is
about 640 miles in diame-
ter, smaller by far than
even Mercury, till then the
smallest known planet.
That was why it had not
been noted earlier.

Nevertheless, it fit

Bode's law, and Piazzi
named it Ceres, alter the
Roman goddess most
closely associated with Sic-
ily.

Invertebrates

Linnaeus (see 1735) and
others in the past three-
quarters of a century had
elaborated the taxonomy of
vertebrates (those animals
with backbones—mam-
mals, birds, reptiles, am-
phibia, and fish) in
considerable detail.

The less familiar and
more diverse animals with-
out backbones (inverte-
brates) were less carefully
considered. Linnaeus had
lumped them all into the
class Vermes (Latin for
“worms”’).

The French naturalist
Jean-Baptiste de Lamarck
(1744-1829) tackled the
problem in publications be-
ginning in 1801. He divided
the invertebrates into
groups and created such di-
visions as the crustaceans
(crabs and lobsters) and
echinoderms (starfish and
sea urchins). He distin-
guished between the eight-
legged arachnids (spiders
and scorpions) and the six-
legged insects. In fact, La-
marck was the first to use
the terms vertebrate and in-
vertebrate, and he popular-
ized the term biology for the
study of life.
