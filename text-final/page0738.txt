and south poles that do not
seem to exist separately.
Objects possessing magne-
tism always have both a
north and a south pole. If
an object could be found
that was only a north pole
or only a south pole (mag-
netic monopoles), then Max-
well's equations could be
made completely symmetri-
cal.

By the Grand Unified
Theory (see 1973, Proton
Decay), it would seem that
magnetic monopoles must
exist but must be so mon-
strously massive that there
could only have been
enough energy to form
them in the immediate in-
stants following the big
bang. Still, if they were
formed then, they should
still exist today, and scien-
tists should be able to de-
tect them.

Therefore, the physicist
Blas Cabrera devised a
setup that would produce
an electric current if a mag-
netic monopole were to
pass through it, and on Feb-
ruary 14, 1982, it produced
such a current.

That single detection
has not yet been repeated,
however, either by Cabrera
or by anyone else, so the ex-
istence of the magnetic
monopole remains in ques-
tion.

Jarvik Hearts

Artificial pumps to replace
the human heart, at least
temporarily, had been at-
tempted (see 1969), but the
best so far was devised by
an American physician,
Robert K. Jarvik (b. 1946).
On December 1, 1982, a Jar-
vik heart was placed into

the chest of a retired den-
tist, Barney Clark, who
lived 112 days with it.
Other patients were later
similarly treated.

On the whole, though,
the Jarvik heart was unsat-
isfactory. It required an out-
side energy source, so the
patient was not freely mo-
bile, and the quality of life
was in general poor.

Laser Printers

The first printers developed
for word-processors were
essentially automatic type-
writers that typed about a
line per second and were as
noisy as typewriters.

In 1982 IBM put laser
printers on the market.
They printed silently and
did some 30 lines per sec-
ond.
