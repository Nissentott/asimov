Palestine came to an end,
and a Jewish nation, Israel,
came into existence on May
14, 1948, for the first time
in nearly nineteen centu-
ries.

Yugoslavia, under
Josip Broz, universally
known as Tito (1892—1980),
broke away from Soviet in-
fluence and established a
Communist regime hostile
to the Soviet Union. The So-
viet Union sent its army
into Czechoslovakia on Feb-
ruary 25, 1948, to make
sure it remained firmly pro-
Soviet.

1949

West Berlin, which was
inside the borders of East
Germany but under West-
ern rule, was blockaded on
July 24, 1948, by the Sovi-
ets, who controlled East
Berlin and East Germany.
The United States began an
airlift to supply West Ber-
lin.

In India Gandhi was as-
sassinated on January 30,
1948, by a Hindu extremist.

Korea became indepen-
dent, but as two separate
nations, a pro-Soviet North
Korea and a pro-American
South Korea under Syngh-
man Rhee (1875-1965).

The Chinese civil war
continued, with the Com-
munists gaining the upper
hand.

The first crossing of the
Atlantic Ocean by jet
planes took place in 1948,
and air-conditioners were
installed in automobiles for
the first time.

Books in 1948 included
Sexual Behavior in the
Human Male by Alfred
Charles Kinsey (1894—
1956), a monumentally dull
book of statistics that be-
came a best-seller because
the statistics dealt with
sex.

 

Icarus

Witt had discovered Eros,
an asteroid whose orbit car-
ried it well within the orbit
of Mars (see 1898). Since
then, a number of asteroids
had been discovered that
could approach Earth more
closely than any planet did.
These were called Earth-
grazers. Some had been dis-
covered that approached
the Sun more closely than
even Venus did. These
were called Apollo-objects,
after the first asteroid of
this type, Apollo, which
had been discovered
in 1937.

In 1949 Baade, who

had discovered the asteroid
Hidalgo (see 1920), discov-
ered an asteroid that was
an Earth-grazer, since it
could come as close as
4,000,000 miles from Earth,
and an Apollo-object too.
Indeed, it approached the
Sun more closely than Mer-
cury did, skimming by at a
distance of only 17,700,000
miles every 1.12 years.
Baade named it Icarus,
after the character in Greek
mythology who lost his life
when he flew on wax wings
too close to the Sun.

Nereid

Kuiper, who had discov-
ered Miranda (see 1948), re-
ported another far distant
satellite in 1949. For a cen-
tury only one satellite had
been known for Neptune, a
large one named Triton.
Now Kuiper detected a
much smaller one, which he
called Nereid. 1t circled Nep-
tune in the most eccentric
orbit of any known satellite.

Atomic Clock

Ever since Huygens had in-

vented the pendulum clock

(see 1654), scientists had de-
pended on accurate time
