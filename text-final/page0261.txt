1785

 

Clusters and
Nebulas

William Herschel (see 1781)
studied the various fuzzy
objects that Messier had
listed (see 1771) and found,
in 1785, that some of them
were not nebulas but clus-
ters of stars, densely
packed (at least by the stan-
dard of our own uncrowded
stellar neighborhood) into a
roughly spherical shape.
We call them globular clus-
ters now and know that
some consist of hundreds of
thousands of stars.

There were some nebu-
las that Herschel couldn't
resolve into constituent
stars. He wondered, like Im-
manuel Kant (see 1755), if
they might not be large col-
lections of stars too far off
to resolve.

In addition, he discov-
ered dark areas in the
Milky Way, small regions
that contained no stars but
that were surrounded on all
sides by countless numbers
of them. Herschel thought
they were holes, which hap-
pened to be pointed in our
direction so that we could
see through into a cylinder
of starlessness.

Galaxy

Herschel reported in 1785
on his attempt to deter-
mine the shape of the con-
glomeration of stars of
which we were part. To
count all the stars all over
the sky was, of course, im-
practical. He therefore took
samples. He chose 683 re-
gions, well scattered, and
counted the stars he could
see in each one. (This was
the first application of sta-
tistical methods to astron-
omy.)

He found that the num-
ber of stars per unit area of
sky rose steadily as one ap-
proached the Milky Way,
was maximal in the plane
of the Milky Way, and mini-
mal in the direction at
right angles to that plane.
This, he thought, would be
explained if the star system
were lens-shaped, with the
Milky Way marking out the
long diameter of the lens
all around.

Such a lens-shaped star
collection had been sup-
posed by earlier astrono-
mers, but Herschel had
now made it a matter of
close observation. For the
first time, the Galaxy truly
took shape, although even
then no astronomer had a

conception of its true size
or of the vast number of
stars it contained. Herschel
thought it contained a hun-
dred million stars—an
enormous underestimate.,

Uniformitar-

o
ianism
Buffon’s attempt to esti-
mate the age of the Earth
(see 1749) had been strictly
speculative. Another at-
tempt was now made by a
British geologist, James
Hutton (1726—1797), who
wished to base it on actual
observation. He spent vears
studying the rocks of every
part of Great Britain care-
fully.

It seemed to him, as a
result of his studies, that
there had been an exceed-
ingly slow evolution of the
Earth's structure. Some
rocks had been laid down
as sediment and slowly
compressed; some had
emerged as lava and then
been slowly worn down by
wind and water.

The great point he
made was that these
changes were taking place
very slowly and had been
doing so in the past. There-
fore, by measuring the rate
