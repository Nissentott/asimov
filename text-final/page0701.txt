days, just two-thirds of the
period of revolution, so that
Mercury showed the same
side to Earth every second
revolution.

Spacewalks

In 1965 human beings were
able to leave their orbiting
rockets and, held by a
tether, remain free in space
—within their spacesuits,
of course. This was referred
to as a spacewalk.

The first to take a
spacewalk was the Soviet
cosmonaut Aleksei Leonov,
who left the rocket ship
Voskhod II on March 18,
1965. The American astro-
naut Edward Higgins
White II (1930-1967) left
his ship, Gemini 4, on June
3, 1965.

Space
Rendezvous

Maneuverability in space
was increasing rapidly. On
December 15, 1965, the
American satellite Gemini
VII, having been in space
for fourteen days, ap-
proached within several
feet of the previously
launched Gemini VI. This
was the first space rendez-
VOUS.

Communications
Satellites

On April 6, 1965, the
United States launched
Early Bird, the first commu-
nications satellite intended
primarily for commercial
use. It made available 240
voice circuits and one tele-
vision channel. In this year
the Soviet Union also
began to send up communi-
cations signals.

Venus Probe

The Soviet Union was mak-
ing repeated efforts to ex-
plore Venus. During the
course of 1965, one of its
Venus probes struck Venus
and became the first hu-
man-made object to reach
another planet.

Holography

Gabor had worked out the
theoretical basis of hologra-
phy (see 1947), a system of
photography that recorded
the interference patterns of
an ordinary and a reflected
beam of light. Holography
made it possible to set up a
real image in space, some-
thing that amounted toa
three-dimensional photo-
graph.’

Once the laser had
been invented (see 1960)
and come into use, it
proved an ideal light source

for the purpose. In 1965
Emmet N. Leith and Juris
Upatnieks, at the Univer-
sity of Michigan, were able
to produce the first holo-
grams.

Microfossils

Until this time the earliest
fossils had been found in
rocks of the Cambrian era
and were a little over 600
million years old. However,
the Earth is 4,500 million
years old. This meant that
the first seven-eighths of
Earth’s history seemed to
show no signs of life. This
seemed unlikely, since the
earliest fossils were already
well developed and quite
specialized forms of life
that could not have come
into existence without a
long evolutionary history.
The trouble was, though,
that prior to the Cambrian
era, organisms had not yet
developed shells and other
hard parts, and softer tis-
sues do not fossilize easily.
In 1965, however, the
American paleontologist
Elso Sterrenberg Bargh-
oorn (1913-1984) worked
with tiny bits of carbonized
material in very ancient
rocks and showed that they
might represent bacteria
living in the early eons of
Earth’s history. When these
bits of material were even-
tually studied by electron
microscope, they showed
