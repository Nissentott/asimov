had thought there might be
some small quantity of gas
in the atmosphere that was
more dense than nitrogen,
and more inert, too, but had
not pursued the matter.
Ramsay repeated the

experiment, and he too
found himself with a small
bubble of gas left over. He
had spectroscopic tech-
niques, however, which
Cavendish had not had.
Ramsay heated the bubble
of gas, studied the spectral

 

lines it emitted, and found
them to be in positions that
fitted no known element.
Clearly here was a hith-
erto-unknown gaseous ele-
ment, which made up
about 1 percent of the atmo-
sphere. It was completely
inert and would not react
with any substance. It was
also denser than nitrogen.
The presence of this new
gas as an impurity in the ni-
trogen obtained from air
gave the nitrogen an abnor-

mally high atomic weight,
whereas nitrogen obtained
from chemicals without
any admixture of this impu-
rity gave the true atomic
weight.

The discovery was an-
nounced on August 13,
1894, and the new gas was
named argon, [rom the
Greek word for “inert.” As
a result, Rayleigh received
the Nobel Prize in physics
and Ramsay the Nobel
Prize in chemistry in 1904.

 

The Early 20th Century (1895—1945)

Discoveries made and theo-
ries formulated at the turn
of the century set off a se-
quence of research that
challenged existing ideas
from the structure of the
atom to the structure of the

 

universe. Investigations on
the subatomic level began
in the late 1890s with the
discovery of X rays by Wil-
helm Conrad Roentgen and
radioactivity by Marie and
Pierre Curie. In 1900 Max

Planck opened the era of
modern physics with his
quantum theory, which
stated that energy was
given off not continuously
but in discrete pieces he
called quanta. The year
