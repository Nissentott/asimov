Plant
Classification

There is a natural tendency
for people interested in nat-
ural history to classify ani-
mals and plants. Aristotle
(see 350 B.c., Animal Classi-
fication) classified the for-
mer, and Theophrastus (see
320 B.c.) classified the lat-
ter. The ancients, however,

had limited access to living
things because so much of
the world was beyond their
ken.

The first to do a mod-
ern job of classification was
an English naturalist, John
Ray (1627-1705). Starting
in 1686, he published what
eventually came to be a
painstaking three-volume
classification of 18,600 dif-
ferent plant species. While

such work might seem to
be mere listing, the basis
for the classification re-
quires a good deal of inge-
nuity, and on the whole,
Ray made good decisions in
these matters. Classifica-
tions such as his made the
matter of biological evolu-
tion seem an overwhelming

likelihood

Laws of Motion

In the nearly eighty years
since Kepler had come up
with the elliptical orbits of
the planets (see 1609), scien-
tists had been trying to
work out what it was that
kept the planets in their or-
bits and made the orbits el-
lipses. It was clear that the
Sun had to attract the plan-
ets somehow, but what was
the attraction and how did
it work?

A number of scientists
got pretty close to what

turned out to be the truth,
notably Hooke (see 1657),
who was a great enemy of
Newton (see 1666). When
Hooke boasted to Halley
(see 1678), who was a great
friend of Newton, that he
(Hooke) had the answer.
Halley went to Newton to
check the matter with him.
Newton said that he had
worked out the answer in
1666 (see 1669, Calculus)
but had never published it.
Halley, in great excitement
urged publication.

Newton could do this

 

now with much greater con-
fidence than he could have
done it twenty years ear-
lier. For one thing, he now
had calculus, which made
some calculations easy that
would have been difficult
before. For another, he had
Picardâ€™s figures on the
Earth's size (see 1684), and
accuracy in that respect
was necessary to his calcu-
lations.

Newton took eighteen
months to write the bock
and, in 1687, published Phi-
losophiae Naturalis Prin-
