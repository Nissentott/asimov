Phonograph

In 1876 Edison had opened
the first industrial research
laboratory, at Menlo Park,
New Jersey. In 1877, the
same year in which he im-
proved the telephone
mouthpiece in a crucial
manner, he also made what
he always said was his fa-
vorite invention—the pho-
nograph (from Greek words
meaning “sound-writing"").

He put tinfoil on a eyl-
inder, set a free-floating
needle skimming over it as
the cylinder turned, and
connected a source that
would carry sound waves
to the needle. The needle,
vibrating in time to the
sound waves, impressed a
wavering track on the tin.
Afterward, following that
track, the needle repro-
duced the sound waves in a
form that was a bit dis-
torted but recognizable.

We all know what the
phonograph, and its much
improved descendants,
have done to bring music
(good and bad) into the
home.

Martian Canals

Every thirty years or so,
Mars and Earth happen to
pass each other where their
orbits are closest. Mars is
then only 35,000,000 miles
from Earth, and astrono-
mers get ready to study it

carefully. One of these close
approaches (or conjunc-
tions) took place in 1877,
and one of those interested
was the Italian astronomer
Giovanni Virginio Schia-
parelli (1835-1910).

For one thing, he tried
to map Mars. Even
35,000,000 miles is a large
distance, and the Martian
atmosphere tends to ob-
scure things (to say nothing
of our own atmosphere), so
that earlier attempts to
map the shadowy markings
on Mars had not been very
successful; different astron-
omers saw different mark-
ings. Schiaparelli, however,
recorded what he saw with
so good a telescope and so
clear an eye that, for once,
other astronomers saw the
same markings he did.
Schiaparelli gave the mark-
ings classical names, and
others were content to use
those names.

Schiaparelli did more.
At this time, and at later,
less favorable conjunctions
of Mars, he detected rather
narrow, dark markings. He
thought they were bodies of
water, so he called the nar-
row ones channels. The Ital-
ian word for channels was
canali, and this was mis-
translated back into En-
glish as canals.

The difference is that
channels refers to natural
bodies of narrow water,
while canals are made by

intelligent beings. The no-
tion came into being, then,
that Mars was a dying
world, with its water
slowly leaking into space;
and that it was home for a
superintelligent race, for
whom the canals were a
huge engineering develop-
ment designed to bring
water from the polar ice
caps to the agricultural
tropics. It was nearly a cen-
tury before that notion was
to be quashed once and for

all.

Martian
Satellites

By now, Jupiter was known
to have four satellites, Sa-
turn seven, Uranus four,
and Neptune one. Of the
inner planets, Earth had
one satellite, but no satel-
lites were known for Mer-
cury, Venus, or Mars.

At the 1877 conjunc-
tion of Earth and Mars, the
American astronomer
Asaph Hall (1829-1907)
seized the opportunity to
make certain that Mars had
no satellites. If it did have,
they would have to be
small and dim, and might
well be very close to Mars,
whose light would tend to
obscure them. Without all
three of those qualifica-
tions, they would certainly
have been seen by now.

Hall therefore began to
