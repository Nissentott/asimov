other by means of an elec-
trified resin rod, the two
cork balls attracted each
other.

Du Fay decided there
must be two electrical flu-
ids and he called them vitre-
ous (from a Latin word for
“glass”) electricity and resin-
ous electricity. One form of
electricity attracted the
other, but each repelled it-
self. This was similar to the
well-known magnetic prop-
erty that like poles repelled
each other but unlike poles
attracted each other. Thus
began the process of de-
tecting similarities and in-
terconnections between

electricity and magnetism,
which was to become par-

ticularly important a cen-

tury later.

Flying Shuttle

In weaving, a shuttle, with
the yarn (the woof)
attached, must be led
across a long series of other
yarns (the warp), in and
out, to form a strong textile
material.

In 1733 a British ma-
chinist, John Kay (1704-
1764), invented the flying
shuttle, a device whereby
the weaver, by pulling a
cord, could activate a
driver that would send the

shuttle flying across the
loom. Pulling the cord in
the opposite direction
would send it on its return
journey. The vertical

(warp) yarns were automat-
ically separated so that the
flying shuttle could pass
quickly in and out through
them.

This was one of the
early examples of a factory
process being mechanized
so that one person could do
more work much more
quickly with far less effort.
It pointed the way to the
coming Industrial Revolu-
tion.
