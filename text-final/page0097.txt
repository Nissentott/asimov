while the crossbow was
being cranked up once, the
longbow could be fired five
or six times. If equal num-
bers of archers with long-
bows and crossbows were

to encounter each other,
the crossbow archers would
be riddled.

The disadvantage of
the longbow, however, was
that the archer had to exert
a force of 90 to 100 pounds
to draw the bow and to

maintain that pull evenly

English longbow archers

 

He put the longbow to the
test against the Scots at the
Battle of Falkirk on July 22,

ever adopted this obvious
weapon. As a result, the En-
