Its existence made per-
nicious anemia easily
treated without the neces-
sity for eating excessive
amounts of liver.

Cortisone and
Arthritis

The American physician
Philip Showalter Hench
(1896â€”1965) was interested
in rheumatoid arthritis, a
painful and crippling dis-
case. Pregnancy and at-
tacks of jaundice relieved
its symptoms, so he conjec-
tured that it was not a
germ disease but a disorder
of metabolism.

Hench tried various
substances, including hor-
mones, in the search for
something that would re-
lieve the symptoms. A de-
cade earlier, the
adrenocortical hormones
had been isolated by Ken-
dall (see 1935, Cortisone),
and it occurred to Hench
that these ought to be tried.
His role as a colonel in the
Army Medical Corps during
World War II delayed him,
but after the war he began
working with the new hor-
mones. He tried Compound
E, also called cortisone,
which had been isolated in
1946, and in 1948 found
that it worked well. For

 

this he received a share,
along with Kendall, of the
Nobel Prize for medicine
and physiology in 1950.
Cortisone proved to be
a tricky substance, how-
ever, to be used only with
great care and judgment.

Tetracyclines

In 1948 a new antibiotic,
chlortetracycline, discov-
ered four years earlier by
the American botanist Ben-
jamin Minge Duggar
(1872-1956), was placed on
the market as Aureomycin.
Its molecule was made up
of four rings of atoms, and
it was the first of a family
of such antibiotics with the
general name of tetracy-
clines. They were effective
over a wide range of micro-
organisms and had low tox-
icity. They are now the
most useful and least dan-
gerous of the antibiotics.

Tissue
Transplantation

It is important for the body
to have weapons against
foreign proteins, since these
may well represent por-
tions of parasites or their
toxins that will cause sick-
ness or death. The body
needs an immune mecha-
nism that can produce anti-
bodies that will combine

with the foreign proteins
and render them harmless.

At times, however, for-
eign proteins help preserve
life. A piece of tissue from
one person may be trans-
ferred to another because
the person receiving the tis-
sue badly needs it. If the
person receiving it then ac-
tivates an immune mecha-
nism to fight it off and
reject it, it may mean
death.

The American geneti-
cist George Snell (b. 1903)
studied this phenomenon.
He believed the capacity of
an organism to reject tissue
from another organism in-
volved genetic factors.
Working with mice, by
1948 he had located the
sites of specific genes (histo-
compatibility genes) that
were concerned in the mat-
ter of acceptance or rejec-
tion. This was a step
toward making tissue trans-
plantation practical.

For this he received a
share of the Nobel Prize for
medicine and physiology in
1980.

Virus Culture

A great many of the ad-
vances in the fight against
bacterial infection over the
previous three-quarters of a
century had resulted from
the ability to grow pure
bacterial cultures in the
