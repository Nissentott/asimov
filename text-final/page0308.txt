higher the atomic weight,
the smaller the specific
heat. This means that if the
specific heat of a new ele-
ment is determined (which
is usually easy to do), an
idea of its atomic weight
can at once be obtained
Since the atomic weight
might be hard to determine
in any other way, this dis-
covery greatly aided Berze-
lius in continuing to im-
prove his table of atomic
weights (see 1818).

 

Steamship

The steamboats designed
and built by John Fitch (see
1787) and later by Robert
Fulton (see 1807) were de-
signed for river travel. Riv-
ers are, after all, gentler
than the open sea, and
banks are always close at
hand in case of accident.

In 1819, however, the
American steamship Savan-
nah (an ocean-going vessel
is a ship, not a boat), sailed

from Savannah, Georgia, to
Liverpool, England, in five
and a half weeks. It was not
much of a steamship, for it
bore sails that did the
major work, while the
steam engine on board was
at work only one-twelfth of
the time. Still, it bore the
promise of things to come.

Electro-
magnetism

There are many resem-
blances between electricity
and magnetism. Both have
opposites (positive and neg-
ative in electricity, north
pole and south pole in mag-
netism). In both cases, op-
posites attract and similars

repel, and in both cases, the
strength of the attraction
or repulsion declines with
the square of the

distance.

For that reason, many
scientists thought there
might be a connection be-
tween the two phenomena.
The results of one experi-
ment were published by the
Danish physicist Hans

Christian @rsted (1777—
1851) in 1820.

As part of a classroom
demonstration, he had
brought a compass needle
near a wire through which
a current was passing. The
compass needle twitched
and pointed neither with
the current nor against it
but in a direction at right
angles to it. When @rsted
