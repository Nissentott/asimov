Decimal
Fractions

Mathematicians had found
fractions difficult to handle
ever since the days of the
Sumerians. Special rules
had to be worked out to
deal with them. In 1586,
however, Stevin (see 1583)
showed that they could be

made part of ordinary posi-
tional notation. To the
right of the units column
(on the other side of a deci-
mal point) could be the
tenths column, then the
hundredths column, and so
on. Thus 2'2 would become
2.25; 2's would become
2.125; 27/s would become
2.875; and so on.

The disadvantage of

such decimal fractions is
that some never end. Thus
23 is 2.3333333 . . . forever;
2% 1s 2.8333333 . . . forever;
and so on. Despite this, dec-
imal fractions greatly sim-
plified computations
involving fractions.

Falling Bodies

Aristotle had stated that
the heavier an object was,
the more rapidly it would
fall. It seemed reasonable
to say so. Why shouldn’t a
heavier body fall more rap-
idly? It is clearly being at-
tracted to Earth more
strongly, or it wouldn’t be

heavier. Furthermore, any-
one who watches a feather,
a leaf, and a stone falling
will see at once that the
stone falls faster than the
leaf, which in turn falls
faster than the feather.
The trouble is that
light objects are impeded
by air resistance, and in
order to avoid that one

should consider only rela-
tively heavy objects. Thus,
if one observes the falling
of a rock that weighs 1
pound and another that
weighs 10 pounds, air resis-
tance is insignificant in ei-
ther case. Do we then see
that the 10-pound rock nev-
ertheless falls faster than
the 1-pound rock?
