Transistor

When radio was in its in-
fancy, crystals were used as
rectifiers, allowing alternat-
ing current to pass in only
one direction. These were
unreliable, however, and
such crystal sets were
quickly replaced by sets
containing radio tubes (see
1904), which had now been
in use in various electronic
instruments, including the
new computers, for over
forty years.

Radio tubes have to be
large enough to enclose a
vacuum, however. They are
fragile, spring leaks, and
frequently have to be re-
placed. They are also ener-
gy-hungry, and one must
wait for the filament to
heat up before the machine
starts working.

In 1948 three physi-
cists, William Bradford
Shockley (b. 1910), Walter
Houser Brattain (1902~
1987), and John Bardeen
(b. 1908)—all American,
though Shockley was Brit-
ish-born—discovered a new
kind of crystal. It consisted
chiefly of germanium,
which conducted an elec-
tric current less well than
metals but better than such
insulators as glass and rub-

ber. Germanium—and sili-
con, which ina few years re-
placed germanium, since
silicon was both cheaper
and better—were consid-
ered examples of semicon-
ductors.

If traces of certain im-
purities were added to the
semiconductor, the crystal
could serve as a rectifier or
as an amplifier. It could, in
short, perform any function
that tubes could.

These semiconductors
were solid (hence solid-state
devices) and required no
vacuum, so that they could
be made quite small. They
were rugged, so that they al-
most never needed replac-
ing. They used very little
energy, and they required
no heating, so that they
began working at once. A
fellow worker, the Ameri-
can electrical engineer
John Robinson Pierce (b.
1910), suggested that the
device be called a rransis-
tor, because it transmitted
current across a resistor.

With time, transistors
replaced tubes completely.
Transistors and the im-
provements that followed
may well prove to be the
most significant technologi-
cal advance of the rwenti-
eth century.

Long-Playing
Records

Until now, records had re-
volved at the rate of 78
times a minute. In 1948 the
Hungarian-born American
physicist Peter Carl Gold-
mark (1906—1977) devel-
oped a record that turned
only 335 times a minute.
Between that and nar-
rowing the track, or needle
groove, six times more
music could be placed on a
single record than had been
possible earlier. An entire
symphony could now fit on
one record.

Cybernetics

The American mathemati-
cian Norbert Weiner (1894—
1964) spent World War IT
working on antiaircraft de-
fense. To shoot down an at-
tacking airplane, one must
know the speed and direc-
tion of the plane's move-
ments, the speed and
direction of the wind, the
speed of the projectile
aimed at the airplane, and
other factors as well. To do
all this accurately and well,
computers were needed
that were far better than
those available at the time.
