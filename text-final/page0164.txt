large as the United States
New Guinea is only 100
miles from northeastern
Australia, and Tasmania is
only 230 miles from south-

eastern Australia, but both
somehow managed to miss
it.

 

In 1644 Tasman did fi-
nally spot a portion of the

Australian coast and called
it New Holland, but he
didn't explore it further.

Barometer

It had long troubled mining
engineers and others that
pumps could not lift water
more than 33 feet above its
natural level. The usual
pump produced a partial
vacuum, which the water
rushed upward to fill, but
apparently the rush had its
limits. The Italian physicist
Evangelista Torricelli
(1608—-1647) worked for
Galileo in that scientist's
last years, and Galileo sug-
sted that his assistant in-
vestigate this pumping
problem.

It occurred to Torricelli
that the water was lifted
not because it was pulled

   

up by the vacuum, but be-
cause it was pushed up by
the normal pressure of air,
After all, the vacuum in the
pump produced a low air
pressure and the normal air
outside the pump pushed
harder

In 1643, to check this
theory, Torricelli made use
of mercury. Since mer-
cury'’s density is 13.5 times
that of water, air should be
able to lift it only Y135 times
as high as water, or 30
inches. Torricelli filled a
6-foot length of glass tubing
with mercury, stoppered
the open end, upended it in
a dish of mercury, un-
stoppered it, and found the
mercury pouring out of the

 

 

tube, but not altogether:
30 inches of mercury re-
mained in the tube, as
expected.

Above the mercury in
the upended tube was a
vacuum (except for a small
quantity of mercury vapor).
It was the first one ever arti-
ficially created—a Torricel-
lian vacuum.

Torricelli noticed that
the height of the mercury
column varied slightly
from day to day and sur-
mised correctly that the
atmosphere possessed a
slightly different pressure
at different times. He had
invented the first barome-
