Pellagra

Pellagra was a disease that
was endemic in the Ameri-
can South after the Civil
War. It didn’t seem conta-
gious, and Funk had specu-
lated that it might be a
vitamin-deficiency disease
(see 1896).

The Austrian-born
American physician Joseph
Goldberger (1874-1929)
noted that it struck wher-
ever the diet was monoto-
nous and limited and did
not include much in the
way of milk, meat, or eggs.

In 1915 he conducted a
dramatic experiment on
prisoners in a Mississippi
jail. Volunteers (who were
promised pardons in re-
turn) were placed on a lim-
ited diet lacking meat or
milk. After six months, they
developed pellagra, which
was relieved by adding
milk and meat to their diet.

During this time Gold-
berger's study group went
to great lengths to try to
contract pellagra by con-
tact with the patients, their
clothing, and their excre-
tions. They failed. Pellagra
was definitely not conta-
gious. Goldberger spoke of
a P-P (pellagra-preventive)

factor in the diet, but its
chemical nature was as yet
unknown.

Thyroxine

About a quarter of a cen-
tury earlier, the thyroid
gland in the throat had
been shown to be responsi-
ble for the overall rate of
metabolism of the body, so
that the human engine
raced, so to speak, when
the thyroid was overactive
and slowed to a crawl when
it was underactive.

Once Starling had ad-
vanced the hormone con-
cept (see 1902 and 1905), it
was clear that the thyroid
must do its work by way of
a hormone. It was known
that the thyroid contained
a characteristic protein
called thyroglobulin, which
was unique in possessing io-
dine, an element not till
then known to be essential
to life,

The American biochem-
ist Edward Calvin Kendall
(1886—1972) studied thyro-
globulin looking for some
simple component that
would do the work of the
thyroid gland in trace quan-
tities and that would there-
fore qualify as the hormone

involved. In 1915 he iso-
lated what he called thyrox-
ine. In the course of
subsequent years, it turned
out to be an iodine-
containing amino acid re-
lated to the tyrosine found
in proteins. It was the hor-
morie.

Bacteriophages

No type of cell is immune
to the ravages of the subcel-
lular parasites called vi-
ruses. Even the smallest
cells, those of bacteria, can
be victimized. The British
bacteriologist Frederick
William Twort (1877—-1950)
discovered, in 1915, a type
of virus that infested and
killed bacteria. The discov-
ery was made again, inde-
pendently, some time
afterward by a Canadian-
born bacteriologist, Felix
d’Hérelle (1873-1949).
D’Hérelle named the vi-
ruses bacteriophages (Greek
for “bacteria-eaters”’).
