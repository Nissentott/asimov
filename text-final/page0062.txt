threatened by the nomads
of central Asia, who were
only too ready to raid the
hard-working Chinese peas-
antry and carry off their

ps for food and them for

 

slaves.

It struck Shih Huang
Ti that the best thing to do
would be to build a wall
across the countryside, a
large wall, tall and wide,
not so much to keep the no-

Parchment

Throughout ancient times,
papyrus had been the mate-
rial on which people had
written, but Egypt was the
only source, and the papy-
rus reed could not be grown
quickly enough to supply
the demand. Besides, the
Egyptian rulers were not
anxious to have other na-
tions build up libraries. So

horses out. The nomads
were helpless without their
horses, and though human
beings may climb even a
difficult wall, a horse can-
not.

This wall was begun in
214 B.c. Initially it was of
earth, but later it was made
of brick. It eventually ex-
tended for 1,500 miles,
from the Pacific Ocean to a
point deep in central Asia.

when the small Hellenistic
kingdom of Pergamum in
western Asia Minor, under
Eumenes 11, who ruled
from 197 to somewhere
around 160 B.c., wished to
build a library that would
rival the one at Alexandria,
naturally the Ptolemies
would not cooperate by
shipping the necessary pa-
pyrus.

It had periodic watchtow-

its job. China was not made
invulnerable by the Great
Wall but it was surely
made less vulnerable.

The Great Wall is the
largest construction project
ever carried out, the only
object made by human be-
ings that outdoes the pyra-
mids (which were, to be
sure, built twenty-five cen-
turies earlier).

invented a new way of treat-
ing hides, about 170 B.C.
Hides had often been used
as writing material, but the
Pergamese learned to
stretch them, scrape them,
and clean them, so that
they ended with a thin
white sheet that could be
covered with writing on
both sides. In later times, it
came to be called parch-
