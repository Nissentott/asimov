Roads

Once carts were developed,
roads were needed. Vehi-
cles could not progress rap-
idly over rocks and
underbrush, and if they
tried, the wheels would be
quickly ruined. That meant
that everywhere roads, rea-
sonably wide, reasonably
straight, and reasonably
smooth, had to be built.
This Rome understood.

In the years after its hu-
miliation by the Gauls,
Rome had perfected the le-
gion, which was a much
more flexible formation
than the phalanx. The pha-

lanx could only fight in
close order, and any une-
venness in the ground
would upset that order. The
legion, on the other hand,
could disperse on uneven
ground without falling into
disarray and could come to-
gether again when condi-
tions allowed.

In 312 B.c. Appius Clau-
dius (4thâ€”3rd century B.C.),
a high Roman official, initi-
ated the building of the Ap-
pian Way, the best road the
world had yet seen. It ex-
tended from Rome to
Capua, a distance of 132
miles. At first it was cov-
ered by gravel, but eventu-

ally it was paved with
blocks of stone and ex-
tended to the heel of Italy.

The road allowed for
the rapid movement of
troops and gave Rome an
enormous advantage in
bringing up reinforcements
or achieving surprise. Even-
tually Rome would build
50,000 miles of roads
throughout its dominions.
Some were over 30 feet
wide. This meant that
Roman armies could be
hurried from one border to
another at quick step, and
relatively small forces
could protect its bound-
aries.
