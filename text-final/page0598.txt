Neutron
Absorption

After Chadwick’s discov-
ery of the neutron (see
1932), the use of neutron
bombardment to in-

duce nuclear reactions
had achieved consider-
able importance, espe-
cially in he work of Fermi
(see 1934).

In 1936 the Hungarian-
born American physicist
Eugene Paul Wigner (b.
1902) worked out the math-
ematics that governed
the manner in which neu-
trons were absorbed by
atomic nuclei. It showed
how the likelihood of neu-
tron absorption varied
with the energy of the
neutron. It also intro-
duced the concept of nu-
clear cross section: the
greater the cross section
of a particular type of nu-
cleus, the greater the
likelihood of its absorb-
ing a neutron.

For this and other
work, Wigner was awarded
a share of the Nobel Prize
for physics in 1963.

Thiamine

Thiamine (also known as vi-
tamin B-1) is the name
given to the vitamin that
prevents beriberi, and
whose existence had come
to be suspected as a result
of Eijkman'’s work (see
1896).

The American chemist
Robert Runnels Williams
(1886—1965) brought this
work to fruition. He had iso-
lated about a third of an
ounce of the vitamin from a
ton of rice polishings, and
this was enough to enable
him to determine its molec-
ular structure. In 1936 he
synthesized thiamine—the
final proof that his struc-
ture was correct.

It was then no longer
necessary to work with
huge quantities of rice pol-
ishings. Thiamine by the
ton could be prepared in
the laboratory.

Perfusion Pump

Carrel (see 1902) was much
in the news in the 1930s

through his demonstrations
that it was possible to keep

organs or tissues alive by
means of perfusion; that is,
by passing blood or blood
substitutes continuously
through the tissues by way
of its own blood vessels. He
kept a piece of embryonic
chicken heart alive and
growing (it had to be peri-
odically trimmed) for over
thirty-four years—much
longer than the normal life
expectancy of a chicken—
before the experiment was
deliberately terminated.

In 1936, to make the
process more efficient, Car-
rel put into use a perfusion
pump that Lindbergh (see
1927) had helped him de-
sign. It drove the blood and
was germ-proof. It was
called an artificial heart,
though it was not the kind
of artificial heart that could
substitute for the natural
one in the human chest.
