Surgery

In ancient and medieval
times, surgery was looked
down upon as an inferior
branch of medicine, since it
involved working with
one’s hands and was un-
comfortably akin to butch-
ery and vivisection

 

Physicians therefore left the

matter of cutting the flesh
to those who also cut hair,
so that the profession of the

barber-surgeon was recog-
nized

One of the French bar-
ber-surgeons was Ambroise
Paré (1510
skillful enough te serve as
surgeon to Henry I of
France (1519-1559) and to

 

 

390), who was

his three sons. Paré is best
known for hi

Most surgeons of the time
practiced searing, disin-

with boiling oil and stop-
ping bleeding by cauteriz-
ing arteries (without
anesthetics, of course). A
torture chamber could
scarcely have been worse
than this treatment.

Paré¢ practiced cleanli-

Trigonometric
Tables

The German mathemati-
cian Georg Joachim Iserin
von Lauchen (1514-1576),

better known as Rhaticus

from the region of his birth,

was a student of Coperni-

  

cus and had been instru
mental in persuading him
to publish his book (see

1543). To help out with the

mathematics required to
determine planetary move-
ments, Rhiticus prepared
trigonometric tables; that
