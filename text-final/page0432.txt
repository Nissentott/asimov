with Mendel's genetic dis-
coveries (see 1865) but
those discoveries were still
being ignored.

Phagocytes

A Russian-born French
bacteriologist, Elie Metch-
nikoff (1845-1916), found
that in simple animals
there were semi-indepen-
dent cells that were capa-
ble of ingesting small
particles. Any damage

to the animals brought
these cells to the spot at
once.

In 1883 Metchnikoff fol-
lowed up this lead and stud-
ied more complicated
animals. He was able to
show that the white cells
in blood were also semi-
independent and were capa-
ble of ingesting bacteria.
The white cells flocked to
the site of any infection,
and what followed was a
battle between bacteria
and what Metchnikoff
called phagocytes (Greek for
“eating cells’"). When the
phagocytes lost heavily,
their disintegrated struc-
tures made up pus.

The white cells, Metch-
nikoff held, were an im-
portant factor in resistance
to infection and disease.
For this work, he received a
share of the Nobel Prize in
physiology and medicine in
1908.

 

Diphtheria

The German pathologist
Edwin Klebs (1834-1913)
discovered the bacterium
responsible for a serious
children’s disease, diphthe-
ria, in 1883.

Maxim Gun

The Gatling gun (see 1862)
had to be cranked. In 1883
an American-barn, British
inventor, Hiram Stevens
Maxim (1840-1916), went
one step further, with a
fully automatic machine
gun. [t made use of the en-
ergy of a fired bullet’s re-
coil to eject the spent
cartridge and load the next.

The Maxim gun gave
European armies a still
greater advantage over na-
tive levies in Africa and
Asia. One popular jingle of
the time went:

“Whatever happens,
we have got

The Maxim gun, and
they have not!"”

However, the time was
to come when non-Europe-
ans found out how to use
advanced weapons, and the
jingle then lost its luster.

Eugenics

From earliest times, human
beings have bred their ani-
mals in such a way as to en-
hance desired

characteristics, so that
larger and speedier horses
were obtained, sheep with
more wool, cows with more
milk, hens with more eggs.
It must have occurred to
many that similar tactics
might improve the human
species.

One who thought this
was the British anthropolo-
gist Francis Galton (1822—
1911), a first cousin of
Charles Darwin. In 1883 he
coined the term eugenics
(from Greek words mean-
ing “good breeding"”) for
the study of the improve-
ment of human qualities by
careful breeding.

However, eugenics is
not easy to put into prac-
tice. In the first place, one
can’t guide human breed-
ing with quite the ease that
one can guide the breeding
of animals. Secand, we are
not as sure of what we want
in human beings as we are
in the case of animals.
Third, when Mendel’s dis-
covery of recessive traits
(see 1865) was understood,
it came to be seen that it
was hard to get rid of what
one might consider undesir-
able characteristics.
Fourth, the loudest support-
ers of eugenics were
unsavory characters who
wished to place it at the
service of prejudice and
racism.
