ent medium is equal to the
speed of light in a vacuum,
divided by the index of re-
fraction of the medium.
(The index of refraction of a
medium is a measure of the
extent to which it will bend
a light ray.)

Roche Limit

Saturn’s rings had now
been known for nearly two
centuries, but their natur
and how they came to
remained uncertain and
controversial.

In this connection
French astronomer, Edou-
ard Albert Roche (1820—
1883), calculated the effect
of one body on another
when at relatively close
range. His conclusions are

He showed that if a )
smaller body circled a

ind if the

and chemical
ignored, then
tidal effects would break up
the smaller body if it ap-
proached within 2': times
the radius of the larger
body. Again, if a cloud of
particles was within 22
times the radius of a large
body to begin with, that
cloud could not be pulled
together into a body by
gravitational forces
None of the satellites
known in the Solar System
at that time were within

2z times the radius of the

:t they circled. How-
aturn’s rings were,
in their entirety, within
that distance.Th clu-
sion was that Saturn'’s tidal
force kept them from con-
densing into a satellite.

Nerve Fibers

The cell theory, which had

been advan by

Schleiden and Schwann

(see 1838), grew firmer with

the years. The German

anatomist Rudolf Albert

von Koll

had shown that eg

sperm might b

ells, and in 1849 he

showed that nerve fibers
ongated outgrowths

of cells.
