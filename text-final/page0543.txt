stars that appeared and dis-
appeared as though they
were exceedingly faint
novas. There were far more
novas in the patch of light
represented by the Andro-
meda nebula than there
were in any other similarly
sized patch of the sky. To
Curtis, this meant that the
Andromeda nebula con-
tained a vast number of ex-
tremely faint stars and that
it was an independent Gal-
axy (as Kant had suggested
—see 1755).

In 1920 Curtis and
Shapley met in a great de-
bate before the National
Academy of Sciences and
discussed the matter of An-
dromeda. Majority opinion
among astronomers was on
the side of Shapley, but Cur-
tis made an unexpectedly
strong showing and won a
moral victory. However,
the matter could not be de-
cided by debate. It had to
await the necessary obser-
vations.

Hidalgo

Asteroids with atypical or-
bits continued to be discov-
ered. In 1920 the German
astronomer Walter Baade
(1893-1960) detected an as-
teroid that he named Hi-
dalgo. At its perihelion, it is
within the asteroid belt,
but its orbit balloons out-
ward, so that at aphelion it

 

is as far from the Sun as Sa-
turn is.

Of all the asteroids that
spend at least part of their
time in the asteroid belt,
none is known to this day
that recedes as far as Hi-
dalgo does.

Dendro-
chronology

Ancient wood is well pre-
served in Arizona’s dry cli-
mate, and the American
astronomer Andrew Elli-
cott Douglass (1867—1962)
grew interested in it.

The wooden trunk of a
tree contains rings that
mark annual growth, wide
ones in good years, narrow
ones in bad years. Since all
trees in a region share the
same good years and bad
vears, all of them have simi-
lar tree-ring patterns.
These patterns are charac-
teristic and do not ever
quite repeat themselves
over time. Therefore, if a
piece of old weod is placed
overlapping the tree-ring
pattern of a freshly pro-
duced tree stump, you can
determine the year in
which the old wood was cut
by counting rings of the
new wood back to where
the overlap begins. You can
then follow its pattern back
farther than you could that
of the fresh wood, still

older pieces of wood can be
fitted on, and so on.

By 1920, when Doug-
lass convinced himself that
such dendrochronology
(Greek for “time-telling by
trees'’) was a practical way
of determining age where
wood was concerned, he
had traced his tree-ring cal-
endar back for about five
thousand years. The tech-
nique was particularly use-
ful in dating objects of
Native American prehis-
tory.

Climatic Cycles

Weather is so erratic that
even the most modern de-
vices have trouble pre-
dicting it long in advance.
Nevertheless, very general
cycles of weather may
exist, and these may ex-
plain the periodic ice ages
that have occurred in the
last million years of Earth’s
history.

In 1920 the Yugosla-
vian physicist Milutin Mi-
lankovich (1879-1958)
suggested that astronomic
factors played a part. Slow
oscillations in the eccentric-
ity of Earth's orbit and in
the tilting of the Earth’s
axis, together with the pre-
cession of that axis, seemed
to suggest a 40,000-year
cycle, which could be di-
vided into a Great Spring,
Great Summer, Great Au-
