layer were worked out by
an English physicist, Ed-
ward Victor Appleton
(1892—-1965). There was a
problem at this time with
the fading of radio signals,
and Appleton found that
this tended to take place at
night. He felt it might be
due to reflection from the

charged layers in the upper

atmosphere, which might
be particularly prominent
in the night sky.

If this were so, such re-
flection might set up inter-
ference, since the same
radio beam would reach a
given spot by two different
routes, one direct and the

 

other by bouncing off the
charged layers.

Appleton experimented
by using a transmitter and
receiver that were about 70
miles apart. He altered the
wavelength of the signal
and noted when the two
beams, direct and reflected,
were in phase, so that the
signal was strengthened,
and out of phase, so that it
was weakened. From this
he could caleulate the mini-
mum height of refllection.
In 1924 he found that the
Kennelly-Heaviside layer
was some 50 miles high

At dawn, the Kennelly-
Heaviside layer broke up,

  

and the phenomenon of fad-

 

particu-
larly noticeable. However

there was still reflection
from charged layers higher
up. These are called Apple-
ton layers and are 150 miles
high.

Because of this content

 

flecting ions, the layer
of air above the strato-
sphere came to be called

of r

 

the ionosphere.

Cytochrome

It had been known for a
long time that oxygen from
the lungs was absorbed by
hemoglobin in the red
blood corpuscles and car-
ried to the cells of the body
What happened to the oxy-
gen within the cells re-
mained unknown, however.

In 1924 the Russian-
born British biochemist
David Keilin (1887—1963)
was studying the absorp-
tion spectrum of the mus-
cles of the horse botfly, and
he noticed four absorp
bands that disappeared
when the cell suspension
was shaken in air but reap-
peared afterward

Keilin suggested, there-
fore, that there was a sub
stance in the cells that
absorbed oxygen. This
substance showed the ab-
sorption bands when it had
not yet absorbed oxygen
but did not show th
