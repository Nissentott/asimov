Chromatin

Studies of the intimate de-
tails of cellular structure
through the microscope
were hampered by the fact
that the cell is transparent,
so that the inner structure
can ordinarily only be seen
as gray on gray.

Perkin, however, had
produced the first synthetic
dye a quarter-century be-
fore (see 1856), and since
then many others had been
produced. It was possible
that a dye might combine
with some intracellular
structures but not with
others. In that case, the
affected structures would
stand out in bright colors

It was in this way that
the German botanist
Eduard Adolf Strasburger

(1844—1912) was able to ob-
serve some of the changes
that took place during cell
division among plants. In
1882 Strasburger divided
protoplasm into two re-
gions, one inside the nu-
cleus, which he called
nucleoplasm, and the other
outside the nucleus, which
he called cytoplasm (the pre-
fix eyto- is from the Greek
word for “cell”). These
words, especially cyto-
plasm, are now common
among biologists.

Much more thorough
studies were made by the
German anatomist Walther
Flemming (1843-1905). He
used a dye that combined
with a material inside the
nucleus that he called ¢hro-
matin, from the Greek word
for “color.”

When he dyed a section
of growing tissue, cells
were caught at different
stages of division. The cells
were killed by the dye, of
course, so that all cell divi-
sions were stopped. What
he saw, therefore, was a se-
ries of “stills” all jumbled
together. Given enough ob-
servations, however, he
could arrange the various
stages in order and deduce
what was happening.

As the proces
vision began, the chroma-
tin collected into short,
threadlike objects, which
eventually came to be
called chromosomes (from
