But almost all the ra-
dioactivity was in the insol-
uble impurity and very
little in the uranium com-
pound. Crookes suspected
that uranium itself might
not be radioactive at all.

However, as Becquerel
speedily pointed out, the
purified uranium com-
pound, which was only
slightly radioactive if at all
steadily gained in radio-
active intensity if allowed
to remain standing. It
was then suggested that
uranium was at least
slightly radioactive and
that as it gave off its radia-
tions, its atoms were con-
verted into other kinds of
atoms, which were much
more intensely radioactive
than uranium.

This was the first sug-
gestion that radioactivity
might represent the sponta-
neous change of one kind of
atom into another. If this
was true, it would imply
that atoms had structure,
and that rearrangement of
the still-smaller particles
that made up atoms took
place in the course of radio-
active breakdown.

Electron
Emission

Edison had discovered the
Edison effect—that an elec-
tric current seemed to
jump the gap between the
heated filament of an elec-

tric light bulb and a cold
metal rod (see 1883).

Beginning in 1900, the
British physicist Owen Wil-
lans Richardson (1879—
1959) studied the phenome-
non and realized that
heated metals tended to
emit speeding electrons,
which carried the electric-
ity. His observation made it
possible to apply the Edi-
son effect to the developing
electronic technology.

For his work, he re-
ceived the Nobel Prize in
physics in 1928.

Mutations

The American evening
primrose had been intro-
duced into the Netherlands
in the 1880s, and in 1886 a
Dutch botanist, Hugo
Marie De Vries (1848—
1935), came across a colony
of them growing in a clump
in a meadow. He could see
that some were very differ-
ent from others, even
though it seemed likely
that all had grown from a
common batch of seeds.

He dug them up, took
them to his garden, and
bred them separately and
together. By 1900 he had
evolved the laws of genetics
that Mendel had worked
out (see 1865).

Unknown to De Vries
and to each other, two
other botanists were mak-
ing the same rediscovery.
One was a German, Karl

Erich Correns (1864-1933),
and the other an Austrian,
Erich Tschermak von
Seysenegg (1871-1962).

Each of the three inde-
pendently decided to pub-
lish his discovery, and each
of the three found, on
searching the literature,
that he had been antici-
pated by Mendel. Each of
the three (in a remarkable
display of scientific ethics)
reported Mendel as the dis-
coverer and presented his
own work merely as con-
firmation.

De Vries, however,
went beyond Mendel. He
had observed that the prim-
roses didn't always breed
true, that some characteris-
tics appeared that didn’t
seem to exist in earlier gen-
erations. He suggested,
therefore, that evolution
did not always proceed in
small, nearly microscopic
steps, but sometimes in
changes large enough to be
clearly visible. He called
these visible changes muta-
tions (from a Latin word for
“change”), and indeed the
concept of mutations now
forms an integral and indis-
pensable part of the theory
of evolution.

Blood Types

Although the usual eigh-
teenth-century practice was
to remove blood from a sick
patient, there were occa-
sional physicians who tried
