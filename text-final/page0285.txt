iments that they must be
less than a millionth of a
meter long.

Two kinds of wave ac-
tion are known, however.
There are longitudinal

 

waves, in which the vibra-

    

tion is
direction in which the
waves are moving. Sound
waves are of this type. In
transverse waves, the vibra-

AC

 

and forth in the

tion is up and down in the

 

ght angles to
that in which the v s are
moving f

direction at ri

 

g. Water waves are of
this type.

that light consisted of longi-
tudinal waves, but in this

he was wrong

 

Niobium

An lish chemist,

Charles Hatchett (1765â€”
1847), analyzed an unusual
mineral in the British Mu-
seum, one that had been
sent there from Connecticut
in pre-Revolutionary days.
In 1801 he reported a new
element in the mineral, an
element he named colum-
bium in honor of the United
States, which was some-
times known by the sobri-
quet of Columbia. There
was, however, a dispute
over whether the substance
was really a new element
or not. By the time it was
finally decided that it was,
its name had become nio-
bium and that is now offi-
cial, so the United States
lost the honor.
