Size of the Earth

Eratosthenes’ figure for the
circumference of the Earth
(see 240 B.c.) had not been
bettered in a thousand
years.

In 1684, however, cer-
tain observations of the
‘ French astronomer Jean Pi-

card (1620-1682) were pub-
lished posthumously.
Instead of noting the dis-
tance of the Sun from the
zenith (the point in the sky
that is directly overhead) at
different places on the
Earth by measuring its
shadow, as Eratosthenes
had done, Picard measured

the distance of a star from
the zenith at different
places. With telescopes,
that was the more accurate
method, and Picard calcu-
lated the Earth's circumfer-
ence as 24,876 miles and its
diameter as 7,900 miles,
figures that are very close
to the best we have today.

Imaginary
Numbers

Mathematicians knew that
‘ the multiplication of two

negative numbers yields a
positive product. Thus, not
only does +1 x +1 = +1,
but -1 x —1 = +1. What
number, then, multiplied

by itself yields —1? To put

 

it another way, what is the
square root of —1?
Mathematicians can in-
vent the necessary number,
call it an imaginary number,
and symbolize it as i for
