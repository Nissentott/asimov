released into the air by
spray cans and eventually
leaked out of air-condition-
ing units, they did not accu-
mulate in such quantities
as to present direct diffi-
culties for any living organ-
ism.

On the other hand,
some chlorofluorocarbons
inevitably drifted upward
into the atmosphere and
there they encountered the
ozone layer. Two American
scientists, F. Sherwood
Rowland and Mario Mol-
ina, pointed out that such
chlorofluorocarbons had
the potential for destroying
the ozone layer, even il they
were present in compara-
tively small amounts. And
indeed, in recent years the
ozone layer has been ob-
served to be thinning.

As the ozone layer
thins, more energetic ultra-
violet light from the Sun
will be able to reach
Earth’s surface, causing in-
creases in the incidence of
such problems as skin can-
cer and cataracts. Worse
vet, the ultraviolet may be
deadly to soil bacteria and
ocean plankton, with incal-
culable effects on Earth's
ecological balance.

Tauon

Up to this point, the lep-
tons that were known in-
cluded the electron, the
electron neutrino, and their

antiparticles and the muon,
the muon neutrino, and
their antiparticles. That
amounted to eight leptons
altogether.

In 1974 the American
physicist Martin L. Perl
found that when electrons
and positrons (antielec-
trons) were smashed to-
gether at high energies, still
a third variety of lepton
was produced. This was
named the tau electron, or
in shorter version, the
tauon. It presumably has a
neutrino of its own, and
there is surely an antiparti-
cle for each, so that twelve
leptons are now known.

The tauon is about 17
times as massive as the
muon and about 3,500
times as massive as the elec-
tron. It is very unstable and
lasts less than five-tril-
lionths of a second before
breaking down to a muon.

It may be that twelve
leptons are all the leptons
there are.

Charmed
Quarks

While there may be only
twelve leptons (see above),
there are a large number of
hadrons, beginning with
the pion, which is the least
massive hadron, through
over a hundred more mas-
sive ones.

Leptons, however, are

fundamental particles,
which cannot be broken
down into simpler ones (as
far as we now know), while
hadrons are composite par-
ticles and are made up of
quarks. Quarks, like lep-
tons, seem to be fundamen-
tal particles.

In 1974 three kinds
of quarks were known:
u-quarks, d-quarks, and
s-quarks. (The letters stand
for up, down, and strange,
respectively, though some-
times the s is made to stand
for sideways to match the
other two.) However, theo-
retical considerations indi-
cated that quarks ought to
exist in pairs. Up-quarks
and down-quarks were a
pair; there ought to be a
quark to serve as the pair of
the strange-quark. Such a
new quark was named a
c-quark even belore it was
discovered, the ¢ standing
for charmed.

In 1974 the American
physicist Burton Richter (b.
1931), using the enormous
energies of the latest parti-
cle accelerators, produced a
particle that, from its prop-
erties, had to include a
c-quark in its makeup. An-
other American physicist,
Samuel Chao Chung Ting
(b. 1936), working indepen-
dently, also produced a par-
ticle that had to contain a
c-quark. The two shared
the Nobel Prize for physics
in 1976.
