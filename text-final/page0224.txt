num. A metallic casket
found among the relics of
seventh century B.c. Egypt
is reported to be of plati-
num. In general, however,
the existence of this metal
remained unremarked and
unknown. For one thing,
platinum is as rare as gold,
but it lacks gold’s ostenta-
tious beauty. Platinum has
a dull, leaden color when

unpolished that does not at-
tract the eye.

In 1748, however, a
Spanish scientist, Antonio
de Ulloa (1716-1795), pub-
lished a report on his trav-
els in South America. In it,
he reported on platina
(from a Spanish word for
“silver,” chiefly because it
was a free metal that
lacked the pronounced

color of gold or copper). He
remarked on its peculiar
properties, for when prop-
erly examined, it turned
out to be denser than gold,
higher-melting, and even
less reactive. Eventually, it
proved extremely useful to
scientists for just these
properties.

Biological
Evolution

Until now, natural histori-
ans who had been busily en-
gaged in classifying life
forms had refrained, out of
religious conviction or out
of prudence, from drawing
the logical conclusion that
biological evolution had
taken place.

The first important sci-
entist to speculate openly
on evolution was the
French naturalist Georges-
Louis Leclerc de Buffon
(1707-1788).In 1749, he

began publishing volumes
of his book Natural History,
which was eventually to
consist of forty-four vol-
umes.

Buffon treated evolu-
tion as a matter of degener-
ation. It is, after all, a
common observation that
many things deteriorate
with time. Why should not
evolution exemplify this?
Buffon maintained that
apes were degenerated hu-
mans, donkeys degenerated
horses, jackals degenerated
wolves, and so on.

This view is quite
wrong, but it implied that

species did change with
time, which was crucially
important. It also sufficed
to get Buffon into a certain
amount of trouble, which
he managed to smooth over
with diplomatic recanta-
tions.

Formation of
the Earth

Buffon (see above) was also
daring enough to think that
there might be some natu-
ral cause, one not involving
God, for Earth’s coming
into existence. In the first
