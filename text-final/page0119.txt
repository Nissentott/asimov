There remained the Inca
Empire, a realm stretching
along the Andes mountain
range, with its center in
what is now Peru and with
a population of about 7 mil-

alpa (ca. 1502-1533), who

In 1531 Francisco Pi-
zarro (ca. 1475-1541)
sailed to Peru with 180
men, twenty-seven cannon
and two horses. In the
course of the next threc
