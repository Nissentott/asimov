Cross Hairs

Although telescopes had
been in use for a generation
by now, they still left the
task of judging distances be-
tween stars to the naked
eye. They showed more
stars and they widened the
distance between them, but
the precision of measuring
that distance remained low.
The English astrono-

mer William Gascoigne
(1612?2â€”1644) invented a
simple solution. In 1641 he
placed fine cross hairs
where the image reached a
focus. A particular spot
could be located and accu-
rately centered at the cross-
ing point of the hairs and
the telescope then shifted
to a neighboring star, mak-
ing use of a device to mea-
sure how great an angle the

telescope had turned
through.

This began the conver-
sion of the telescope from a
mere viewing toy to an in-
strument of precision. How-
ever, Gascoigne was killed
in battle before he could
properly develop his discov-
ery. It was twenty years be-
fore cross hairs were
rediscovered and put to
general use in telescopes.
