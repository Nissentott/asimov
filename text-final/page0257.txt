Hevel, known as Hevelius
(1611~1687).

Another variable star
was noted in 1672 by an
[talian astronomer, Gemi-
niano Mantanari (1633—
1687). That was Beta Per-
sei, better known as Algol
(from an Arabic word mean-
ing “the ghoul,” because it
represented the head of the
monster Medusa in the con-

stellation). Algol did not
vary in brightness as much
as Mira did, but Algol's
variations, unlike Mira's,
were quite regular.

In 1782 Algol was stud-
ied by a British astrono-
mer, John Goodricke
(1764—1786), a deaf-mute.
To account for the regular-
ity of Algol’s variations, he
suggested that it might

have a dim companion that
circled it in our line of sight
and periodically eclipsed it,
hiding most of the light.

In this, he proved to be
perfectly right, but not all
variable stars are eclipsing
variables. Mira isn't. Its
variations are so irregular
that no eclipse can possibly
be involved.

Motion of
the Sun

To the ancients, the Earth
was the motionless center
of the Universe. To the
early moderns, the Sun
was.

In 1783, however, Her-
schel began a systematic
measurement of the proper
motion (see 1781) of a great
many stars. Very dim and
very distant stars moved so
slightly they could be con-
sidered motionless and

were references against
which the perceptible mo-
tions of the nearer stars
could be measured.

As the years passed,
Herschel found that in one
direction in the sky, the
stars were generally mov-
ing away from each other,
while in the opposite direc-
tion they were very slowly
closing in toward each
other. In 1805 he came to
the conclusion that this
could best be explained by
supposing that the Sun it-
self was moving toward

that point from which stars
seemed to be separating
and was moving away from
the point toward which
other stars s
converging.

Just as Copernicus (see
1543) had maintained that
the Earth was a planet like
other planets, moving as
they did, so Herschel now
maintained that the Sun
was a star like other stars
and was moving as they
did.

But if neither the Earth
nor the Sun was the mo-

eemed to be
