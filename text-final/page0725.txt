A third pair of quark

 

the -quark and the b-quark
(which may stand for top
and bottom, or for truth and
beauty, depending on the
level of whimsy), undoubt-

edly exist also. II so, there
are twelve quarks (the ones
I've mentioned and their
antiparticles) to match the
twelve leptons. This may be
significant, though no one

yet can explain why quarks
and leptons should match
each other in number, or
why that number should be
twelve.

 

 

Microchips

Since transistors had first
been developed (see 1948),
they had been made stead-
ily smaller, cheaper, and
more reliable. By 1975 they
had become so small, and
the circuits upon them had
been etched in so compact
a manner, that they could
be called microchips.
This meant that com-
puters also could be made
very small, very cheap, and
very powerful. And this
made possible personal
computers, the first of
which were introduced in
1975, foreshadowing the

 

 

coming of word-processors
and robots.
With the microchip,

the computer was no longer

suitable only for govern-
ment and large industries.
It began to invade the do-
main of the general public.

 

Surface of
Venus

In 1975 the Soviet probes
Venera 9 and Venera 10
managed to make success-
ful soft landings on the
planet Venus and to endure
long enough to take photo-
graphs of a rocky surface. It

was clear that sufficient
light penetrated the cloud
layer to make photographs

possible.

Endorphins

It was discovered in 1975
that the nervous system
gives rise to compounds
that alleviate pain, These
cons
amino acids that seem to in-
teract with the pain-recep-

t of short chains of

 

tors. Presumably, morphine
and similar opiates work

by mimicking the action of

these substances, which are

  

now called endorphins. The

first part of the name indi-
