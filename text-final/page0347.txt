Mechanical
Equivalent of
Heat

Some conservation laws
had already been accepted
by this time. Lavoisier had
advanced the law of conser-
vation of mass (see 1789)
and before that there had
been the law of conserva-
tion of momentum (see
1668).

There were suspicions
that energy ought to be con-
served also. After all, mo-
tion was a common form of
energy, and according to
Newton, a moving body
would move on forever if
not affected by an outside
force. The energy would not
disappear.

In real life, though, a
moving body does stop mov-
ing after a while because of

air resistance or because of
friction with the ground.
What happens to its energy
then? Perhaps it is con-
verted into heat. If so, how-
ever, a given amount of
mechanical energy should
be converted into some
fixed amount of heat. Other-
wise energy is hot con-
served.

A British physicist,
James Prescott Joule
(1818—1889), undertook to
check this by experimenta-
tion. He expended energy
in a variety of ways and
measured the amount of
heat produced. All his ex-
periments showed that a
fixed quantity of work
ended up in a fixed quan-
tity of heat. In 1843 he pub-
lished his results: that
41,800,000 ergs of work pro-
duce 1 calorie of heat. This
is called the mechanical

equivalent of heat. Since
10,000,000 ergs are now
called a joule in Joule's
honor, we can say that 4.18
joules equal 1 calorie.

This made it appear
that there might well be a
law of conservation of en-
ergy if heat were included
among the forms of energy.
In fact a German physicist,
Julius Robert von Mayer
(1814-1878), had presented
a figure of the mechanical
equivalent of heat in 1842
(one that was far less accu-
rate than Joule’s) and de-
duced from it that a law of
conservation of energy ex-
isted, but his work did not
attract attention
