the longer the delay, the
more terrific the crash. Un-

Liquid
Ammonia

Water with substances dis-
solved in it melts at a lower
temperature than pure
water does. The French
chemist Louis-Bernard
Guyton de Morveau (1737-
1816), by adding calcium
chloride to an ice and water
mixture, brought about a
temperature drop to —44°
C. He used this low temper-
ature to liquefy the gas am-
monia, which becomes
liquid at a temperature of
=332,

This was the first time
a substance until then
known only as a gas was
chilled to liquid form.

Interchangeable
Parts

In 1798 Eli Whitney, who
had invented the cotton gin
(see 1793), was awarded a
contract to manufacture
ten thousand muskets for
the American government.
Up to that time, every
musket (and indeed every
device consisting of more
than one part) had been
made with each part ad-
justed to fit the adjoining
part. If a part was broken, a
new one had to be adjusted
manually, A corresponding
part from a similar device
would not necessarily (and,
in fact, would virtually
never) replace the broken
part without adjustment.
Whitney, however, ma-
chined his parts with such
precision that a particular
part could replace any
other one of that part. The
story is that when the mus-

kets were done he brought
some of them, disassem-
bled, and placed them at
the feet of a government of-
ficial. Then, picking out
parts at random, he put to-
gether a working musket.

The development of
methods for producing in-
terchangeable parts was an
important part of the devel-
oping Industrial Revolu-
tion.

Beryllium

In 1798 Vauquelin, who
had discovered chromium
(see 1797), recognized the
existence of a new element
in the gems beryl and emer-
ald. He named the element
beryllium.
