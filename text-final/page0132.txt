World Maps

Once the Age of Explora-
tion began, it became im-
portant to try to map the
world in general and to do
so accurately, so that
navigators could reach
their destinations more
easily.

The difficulty was that
one cannot map a spherical
surface on a plane surface
without distortion. Since
distortion is unavoidable,
therefore, one must find a
distortion that will remain
useful.

The answer was sup-
plied by a Flemish geogra-
pher, Gerhard Kremer
(1512-1594), better known
by his Latinized name, Ge-
rardus Mercator. In 1568,
Mercator perfected his cy-
lindrical projection.

Imagine a hollow cylin-

der encircling the Earth
and touching it all around
the equator. A light at the
Earthâ€™s center can then be
imagined as casting the
shadow of the surface fea-
tures on the cylinder, and
the cylinder, when un-
wrapped, will carry a map
of the world, a Mercator
map.

In this map, the meridi-
ans of longitude are verti-
cal and parallel. Since, on
the sphere, the meridians of
longitude approach each
other and meet at the poles,
this means that in a Merca-
tor projection, the east-west
distances are increasingly
exaggerated as one travels
north or south from the
equator. The parallels of
latitude run horizontal and
parallel, as they do on the
sphere, but as one goes
north and south from the

equator, they spread out
more widely, too.

On such a map, Green-
land looks larger than Af-
rica, although in actual
fact, Africa is thirteen times
as large as Greenland.

Nevertheless, the Mer-
cator projection is useful
for navigators, because a
ship that travels in any con-
stant compass direction
moves in a straight line on
the Mercator projection but
in a curved line on any
other type of projection.

The cover of Mercator's
book of maps showed Atlas,
the mythological Greek
Titan, holding the world on
his shoulders. As a result,
that book and all later
books of maps have been
called atlases.

With Mercator, Greek
geography ended and mod-
ern geography began.
