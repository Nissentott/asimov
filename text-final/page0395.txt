which took only 5 minutes
to produce results. With
this elinical thermometer,
taking a patient’s tempera-
ture became truly routine.

Kirkwood Gaps

By now, nearly ninety aster-
oids had been discovered
and their orbits calculated.
It was clear that they were
not evenly distributed, and
the American astronomer
Daniel Kirkwood (1814—
1895) showed in 1866 that
there were definite gaps,
since called “Kirkwood
gaps.”

He explained these
gaps by postulating that
any asteroids that would
have been in those gaps
would revolve around the
Sun in a period that bore a
simple ratio to the period
of Jupiter. That meant that
every two or three turns of
the asteroid would bring it
into the same position with
respect to Jupiter. Jupiter's
gravitational pull would
then be cumulative, and
the asteroid would be
forced either farther from
the Sun or nearer to it, leav-
ing a gap.

He pointed out that the
gaps in Saturn's rings ex-
isted for similar reasons. If
there were ring particles in
Cassini’s division, for in-
stance, those particles
would revolve about Sa-
turn in just half the period
of Saturn's satellite,
Mimas.

 

  

Earth’s Iron
Core

Ever since Cavendish had
determined the Earth’s
mass (see 1798), it had been
known that the Earth's av-
erage density was about
twice that of its rocky
crust. The conclusion was
that Earth’s center must be
made of material that was
denser than rock. Metal
seemed to be the only rea-
sonable alternative.

The French geologist
Gabriel-Auguste Daubrée
(1814—-1896), considering
the fact that a number of
meteorites were composed
of a nickel-iron alloy
(though most were rocky),
assumed that if meteorites
were remnants of an ex-
ploded planet, the rocky
ones came from the outer-

Lt d

most portions of the planet,
and the nickel-iron ones
came from its core. He rea-
soned that this would be
true of Earth as well, so
that Earth had a nickel-
iron core. This has been ac-
cepted by geologists ever
since.

Composition of
a Nova

Since the exceedingly
bright novas spied by
I'ycho Brahe and by Kepler
nearly three centuries be-
fore, further novas of the
sort had been seen. Never-
theless, dim novas had
been sighted, and they still
attracted notice because
they had brightened sud-
denly and without warning.
In 1866 Hug

showed from its spectral
lines that it was sur-
rounded by a cloud of hy-
drogen. This was the first
indication that hvdrogen
