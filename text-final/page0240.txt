Quantitative
Chemistry

Although Black had demon-
strated the usefulness of
quantitative measure-
ments in chemistry (see
1754), what made them an
integral part of the science
was the work of French
chemist Antoine-Laurent
Lavoisier (1743—1794), who
isuniversally considered the
father of modern chemistry.

There were at this time
some who still clung to the
Greek theory of elements
and their changeability.
They argued that if water
were boiled for a long time,
a sediment appeared, and
that this was clearly a con-
version of water into a kind
of earth, in line with Greek
thinking.

Lavoisier decided, in
1769, to test this matter. He
boiled water for 101 days in
a device that condensed the

water vapor and returned it
to the flask, so that no
water was lost in the pro-
cess. He weighed both
water and vessel before and
after the boiling.

Sediment did appear,
but the water did not
change its weight during
the boiling, so the sediment
wasn’t formed out of the
water. The flask itself, how-
ever, had lost an amount of
weight just equal to the
weight of the sediment. In
other words, the sediment
was material from the
glass, slowly etched away
by the hot water and precip-
itating in solid fragments.
Here was a clear-cut exam-
ple of the way in which ob-
servation, without
measurement, could be use-
less and misleading.

Spinning Frame

The textile industry was in-
creasingly important for

Great Britain, and any me-
chanical device that could
increase production would
add to the wealth of those
who owned the mills and
factories.

In 1769 an English in-
ventor, Richard Arkwright
(1732-1792), invented a
spinning frame: a mechani-
cal device that could pro-
duce cotton threads hard
enough and firm enough to
be used in textile manufac-
ture. The frame helped pro-
duce textiles not only faster
than handworkers could
but so simply that Ark-
wright could work with rel-
atively unskilled operators
who would do the work for
little money. Arkwright
died a millionaire, but at a
cost. Many were thrown
out of work by his inven-
tion and went hungry, be-
cause the government at
this time did not consider
itself responsible for the
welfare of its citizens.
