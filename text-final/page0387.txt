opaque to the infrared radi-
ations that the Earth gives
off to space when it cools
down at night.

This means that the
presence of even a small
amount of carbon dioxide
and water vapor in the air
will keep the Earth's sur-
face temperature higher
than it would otherwise be
This resembles the situa-
tion in a greenhouse, where
light enters through the
glass and warms the atmo-
sphere within, but heat es-
capes only with difficulty,
so that the net effect is to
warm the greenhouse. For
this reason, the action of
carbon dioxide and water
vapor is referred to as the
greenhouse effect

Since human activity
has somewhat increased
the carbon dioxide of the at-
mosphere and is continuing
to do so, the greenhouse ef-
fect has become a serious
threat.
