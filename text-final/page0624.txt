cleic acids were not small
molecules after all. Meth-
ods of isolating DNA had
been so harsh that the mole-
cules were recovered in
small fragments. Gentler
isolation retrieved larger
molecules. It was also no-
ticed that in sperm cells,
where chromosomes were
condensed to minimum
size, the protein portion
seemed unusually simple
while the DNA seemed pres-
ent in the usual quantity
and complexity. Neverthe-
less, faith in proteins re-
mained unshaken.

At this time, a Canadi-
an-born American bacteri-
ologist, Oswald Theodore
Avery (1877-1955), was
working with pneumococci
—bacteria that caused
pneumonia. Two different
strains were grown in the
laboratory—one with a
smooth coat made up of a
complicated carbohydrate
molecule and one with a
rough surface. The strains
were called S (for smooth)
and R (for rough).

Clearly the R strain
lacked a gene for the forma-
tion of the carbohydrate
surface. It was possible to
prepare an extract from the
S strain that contained no
cells and was clearly nonliv-
ing, which on addition to
the R strain would convert
it into an S strain. The ex-
tract must contain the gene

 

(or transforming principle)
that catalyzed the produc-
tion of the carbohydrate.
But what was the chemical
nature of the transforming
principle?

In 1944 Avery and his
associates purified the
transforming principle as
far as they could while still
leaving it functional and
showed that it was DNA in
nature and nothing else.
There was no protein pres-
ent. This was the first indi-
cation that the genetic
material in cells was DNA
and not protein. The discov-
ery revolutionized genetics,
which now began a quick
advance.

Avery's discovery was
clearly worthy of a Nobel
Prize, but he died too soon
to receive one.

Paper
Chromatography

Chromatography, which
had been devised by Tsvett
(see 1906), worked well in
separating complex mix-
tures, but it was slow and
required a considerable
quantity of solution.

In 1944 two British bio-
chemists, Archer John Por-
ter Martin (b. 1910) and
Richard Laurence Milling-
ton Synge (b. 1914),
invented paper
chromatography. Instead of
dripping the mixture

through a column of absor-
bent powder, this tech-
nique allowed it to creep
up a column of absorbent
filter paper. The paper could
then be turned at right
angles and dipped into an-
other solvent, so that if the
first did not separate the
mixture entirely, the sec-
ond, working on an already
partially separated mix-
ture, would complete the
job.

Paper chromatography
was faster than ordinary
chromatography and
worked on mere drops of so-
lution. It was an excellent
technique for separating
the complex mixtures that
were formed when a pro-
tein molecule was broken
into fragments. For this
work, Martin and Synge
were awarded the Nobel
Prize for chemistry in 1952.

The need to make use of
uranium hexafluoride in
the development of the nu-
clear bomb (see 1940) led to
an intensive study of fluo-
rine compounds and in par-
ticular of fluorocarbons.
These were molecules in
which all the free valences
of a carbon chain or ring
were occupied by fluorine
atoms.

It was possible to de-
velop long chains of carbon
atoms with fluorine atoms
