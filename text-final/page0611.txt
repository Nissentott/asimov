brevis. He named it tvrothri-
cin. This was found to be a
mixture of several polypep-
tides (amino acid chains
rather smaller than those
found in proteins gener-
ally).

Tyrothricin was not a
very effective antibacterial
agent, but it and penicillin
ushered in an era character-
ized by the most powerful
weapons against infection
the medical profession had
yet possessed.

Essential
Minerals

In 1939 Keilin, who had
demonstrated the existence
of the cytochromes (see
1924), showed that the en-
zyme carbonic anhydrase
contained a small quantity
of zinc that was essential to
its working. This meant
that since the enzyme was
essential to life, so was
zinc.

A number of elements,
usually associated with
minerals rather than with
life, have since been shown
to be essential to life in
trace quantities because of
their association with en-
zymes. Included are manga-
nese, molybdenum, and
copper. These may be
grouped together as essen-
tial minerals, or essential
trace elements.

DDT

The most serious enemies
of humanity, next to patho-
genic microorganisms, are
the insects. Not only do
they carry and spread dis-
eases such as yellow fever,
malaria, typhus, and en-
cephalitis, but they also eat
crops and make serious in-
roads into the human food
supply. Through the ages,
they have been feared and
fought, and as knowledge of
chemistry grew, poisons
had been used to kill them.
Unfortunately, the inor-
ganic poisons used, such as
Paris green, were deadly to
mammals, including
human beings.

The Swiss chemist Paul
Hermann Miiller (1899—
1965) began a search for or-
ganic substances that
might be poisonous to in-
sects but not to other forms
of life, and that would also
be cheap, stable, and with-
out unpleasant odor.

In September 1939 he
tried dichlorodiphenyl-
trichloroethane (of which
the common abbreviation
is DDT), a compound
known to chemists since
1873, and it seemed to ful-
fill all the requirements.
DDT proved exceedingly
valuable in the years to
come, particularly in fight-
ing lice-spread typhus, so
that Miller was awarded
the Nobel Prize for medi-

ALY

cine and physiology in
1948.

In time, to be sure,
DDT turned out to have its
harmful aspects after all,
and its use dwindled. Nev-
ertheless, it was the fore-
runner of a great variety of
pesticides that have served
humanity.

Helicopter

One problem with air-
planes is that they must
move quickly in order to
produce aerodynamic lift
under their wings. If they
slow up, the lift dwindles
and they crash, A device
that exerted a force straight
upward instead of merely
forward as propellers do
would eliminate this neces-
sity for speed-born lift.

The obvious solution
was a large propeller di-
rectly overhead. Since the
ends of the propeller would
mark out a helix as the vehi-
cle lifted upward, such a de-
vice was called a helicopter,
from Greek words meaning
“helical wing.”

The Russian-born
American aeronautical en-
gineer [gor Ivan Sikorsky
(1889-1972) had been work-
ing with helicopters for
thirty years and finally in
1939 produced a satisfac-
tory model. On September
14, a helicopter with Sikor-
sky himself at the controls
flew successfully. The time
