disproved in the new sys-
tem, and so on forever,

Godel had thus ended
the search for certainty in
mathematics by showing
that it did not and could
not exist, just as Heisen-
berg had in physics (see
1927).

However, Godel's proof
does not affect the nitty-
gritty of ordinary mathe-
matics. Two plus two is
still four.

Neutrino

For over a decade, physi-
cists had been plagued with
the problem of beta-parti-
cle emission. Beta particles
might be fired out of a nu-
cleus with all the energy to
be expected from the loss in
mass as one nucleus broke
down into another. Gener-
ally, though, they came out
with less energy, and to an
unpredictable degree. They
sometimes emerged with
very little energy, in fact,
and some physicists, in de-
spair, felt that the law of
conservation of energy sim-
ply didn't hold in connec-
tion with beta-particle
emission.

In 1931, however,
Pauli, who had worked out
the exclusion principle (see
1925), suggested an expla-
nation that did not violate
energy conservation. He
suggested that, along with

the electron, another parti-
cle was given off, and that

the energy was divided be-
tween the electron and the
other particle in a random
manner.

Since the electron had
all the electric charge avail-
able, the other particle had
to be electrically uncharged,
or neutral. Since all the ki-
netic energy of an electron
could be converted into only
a tiny quantity of mass, the
other particle would have
little or no mass.

The next year Fermi,
who had devised a mathe-
matical treatment for elec-
tron distribution (see 1926),
named the other particle
the neutrino (Italian for “lit-
tle neutral one").

Since it lacked both
mass and electric charge,
the neutrino was sure to be
very difficult to detect, as-
suming it existed at all, and
for a quarter of a century it
remained a kind of “ghost
particle,” with theoretical
reasons for existing but
backed by no observational
evidence.

Deuterium

As more and more stable el-
ements proved to be made
up of mixtures of isotopes,
there was considerable feel-
ing that even the lightest
and simplest of the ele-
ments, hydrogen, ought to
consist of isotopes. Hydro-

217

gen has an atomic weight
of very close to 1, so that if
it did consist of isotopes, hy-
drogen-1 must be over-
whelmingly the most
common. Still, there might
be very small quantities of
hydrogen-2 present.

The American chemist
Harold Clayton Urey
(1893—-1981) tackled the
problem in 1931. He rea-
soned that hydrogen-2,
being the more massive
atom, would be less easily
evaporated than hydrogen-
1. If, then, he slowly evapo-
rated a large quantity of
liquid hydrogen, the final
bit of liquid ought to have a
percentage of hydrogen-2
larger than that in the sup-
ply he began with.

Now if hydrogen-2
were present, its spectral
lines ought to have slightly
different wavelengths than
those of hydrogen-1, and
the ordinary hydrogen spec-
trum ought to have, accom-
panying each spectral line,
a very faint one nearby—
too faint to be sure of.

However, when most of
the liquid hydrogen had
evaporated, leaving an
unusually high concen-
tration of hydrogen-2, the
hydrogen-2 lines ought to
become more prominent
and should be unmistak-
able.

This turned out to be
50, and Urey announced
the discovery at once.
