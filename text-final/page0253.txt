of thermodynamics, de-
scribed in 1850 by Rudolf
Clausius, stated that not all
energy is equally useful and

that the amount of avail-
able energy in the Universe
is constantly decreasing.
Three innovations of this

phabet and printing had
done—the metric system,
the system devised to repre-

telegraphic communica-
tion.

 

Uranus

Since prehistoric times,
human beings had been
aware of the five bright star-
like planets: Mercury,
Venus, Mars, Jupiter, and
Saturn. With the coming of
Copernican principles (see
1543), Earth itself became a
sixth, coming between
Venus and Mars. It seemed
somehow impossible that
there could be another.
Surely, if there were an-
other, it would have been
seen.

In the 1770s, a British
astronomer (of Hanoverian
birth) began studying the
heavens. He was William
Herschel (1738-1822). A
music teacher by profes-
sion, he had grown inter-
ested in astronomy. Unable
to buy a telescope he con-
sidered sufficiently good, he
took to grinding his own
lenses and mirrors and
ended with the best tele-
scopes of his time.

He determined to
study, systematically, ev-

erything in the sky, and on
March 31, 1781, he came
across an object that ap-
peared as a disc instead of
as a mere point of light. He
supposed it to be a comet,
but the disc had sharp
edges like a planet and
wasn't fuzzy as a comet
would be. Furthermore,
when enough observations
had been made to calculate
an orbit, he found that
orbit to be nearly circular,
like a planet’s, and not elon-
gated, like a comet's.
What’s more, it was clear
that the object’s orbit lay
far outside that of Saturn.
It was twice as far from the
Sun as Saturn was, and no
comet could be seen from
that distance.

The conclusion was
that Herschel had discov-
ered a seventh planet cir-
cling the Sun, which
because of its great dis-
tance did not appear as
bright as the others. In fact,
it was visible to the un-
aided eye as a very dim star
and had been observed a

number of times by people
who never suspected it
might be a planet. The first
had been Flamsteed (see
1676), who had recorded its
position on his star map a
century earlier and called it
34 Tauri.

After some hesitation,
astronomers decided to con-
tinue naming planets for
mythelogical characters,
and the new planet was
named Uranus, after the fa-
ther of Saturn (Cronos) in
the Greek myths.

The discovery of Ura-
nus doubled the size of the
Solar System at a stroke. It
was further spectacular
proof that the ancients had
not known everything, and
gave astronomers the excit-
ing knowledge that there
was more to be discovered
in the sky than additional
comets.
