that Mendeleyev had pre-
dicted for it once again
turned out to be absolutely
correct. Three predictions
made, three predictions ful-
filled. [t was as amazing a
feat as the discovery of Nep-
tune (see 1846).

Fluorine

For three-quarters of a cen-
tury, chemists had known
that a certain element must
exist. They had even given
it a name—flourine. How-
ever, it was a particularly
active element, the most ac-
tive one known, more ac-
tive than oxygen and
chlorine, and nothing
seemed capable of forcing
it out of combination with
other elements.

A number of chemists
tried to isolate it and found
the matter not only difficult
but dangerous, for the ma-
terials they had to work
with were poisonous.

Finally, a French chem-
ist, Henri Moissan (1852—
1907), tried. He used plati-
num for all his equipment,
because it was one of the
very few substances that
fluorine would not attack
and combine with in-
stantly. If he isolated some
fluorine in platinum, that
fluorine would stay iso-
lated.

He placed a solution of
potassium fluoride in hy-
drogen fluoride in his plati-

num equipment, chilled it
to —50° C to tame the fluo-
rine a bit, and passed an
electric current through it
on June 26, 1886. He ob-
tained a pale yellow gas
that was the long-sought
fluorine. i

For this, he obtained
the Nobel Prize in chemis-
try in 1906 (receiving, ac-
cording to report, one vote
more than Mendeleyev did,
which if true was an injus-
tice, for Mendeleyev was
more deserving).

Dysprosium

Lecog de Boisbaudran, who
had already isolated gal-
lium (see 1874) and samar-
ium (see 1879), was
working on a rare earth ore
containing holmium when
he discovered that it con-
tained a small amount of
still another rare earth ele-
ment, which he named dys-
prosium, from a Greek
word meaning “hard to get

at.

Canal Rays

Goldstein, who had given
cathode rays their name
(see 1876), continued to
work with them. In 1886 he
used a perforated cathode,
one with small holes, or
channels, penetrating it.
When he did this, he found
that not only did cathode
rays emerge as usual,

but radiation passed
through the channels and
streamed in the opposite
direction.

He called the radiation
Kanalstrahlen, which is Ger-
man for “channel rays,”
but they were usually
called canal rays, by the
same mistranslation that
had given rise to the notion
of Martian canals (see
1877).

Raoult’s Law

The French physical chem-
ist Frangois-Marie Raoult
(1830—-1901) showed in
1886 that the partial pres-
sure of solvent vapors in
equilibrium with a solution
is directly proportional to
the ratio of the number of
solvent molecules to solute
molecules. This is called
Raoult's law.

To the nonchemist, the
law may seem unclear, but
it provided chemists with a
new way of calculating the
molecular weight of dis-
solved substances. It also
showed that the freezing
point was depressed, and
the boiling point elevated,
in proportion to the num-
ber of particles present in a
given volume of solution.
Arrhenius had assumed this
when he had worked out
his theory of ionic dissocia-
tion two years earlier (see
1884).
