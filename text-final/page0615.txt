Betatron

Cyclotrons were used to ac-
celerate protons, which are
massive particles and ener-
getic enough to get results
even when they are not
moving at very high speeds
(see 1930).

It might be useful to ac-
celerate electrons, but they
are so light that to obtain
useful energies they would
have to be brought to
speeds quite close to that of
light. That would introduce
a mass increase according
to special relativity (see
1905) and cause the acceler-
ating pulse to go out of syn-
chronization, setting a too-
low limit on the speeds
achieved.

In 1940, however, the
American physicist Donald
William Kerst (b. 1911) de-
vised an accelerator that
whirled the electrons in cir-

cles rather than spirals.
This new device, called the
betatron (because it accel-
erated beta particles),
made useful electron bom-
bardment possible.

   

Streptomycin

Dubos’s discovery of tyro-
thricin (see 1939) had gal-
vanized one of his past
teachers, the Russian-born
American microbiologist
Selman Abraham Waks-
man (1888—1973).

Using Dubos'’s meth-
ods, Waksman began to
search for bacteriocidal
compounds in microscopic
fungi. In 1940 he located
one he called actinomycin
because it was found in
fungi of the Actinomycetes
family. Not long after, he
found one in fungi of the
Streptomycetes family and
called it streptomycin.

Streptomycin was
quite effective against bac-

 

teria that were not affected
by penicillin but was con-
siderably more toxic to
human beings than penicil-

615

lin and had (o be used very
cautiously.

It was Waksman who
coined the term antibiotic
(from Greek words mean-
ing “‘against [microscopic]
life™), and for his work on
them, he was awarded the
Nobel Prize for medicine
and physiology in 1952.

Color Television

Although television existed
as a laboratory exercise
only and wouldn't enter the
American home till after
World War I1, methods
were already being devel-
oped to transmit television
in full color.

The first to work out
such a system was the Hun-
garian-born American engi-
neer Peter Carl Goldmark
(1906-1977), who used a ro-
tating three-color disk for
the purpose in 1940. The
method was not, in the end,
used. More effective meth-
ods were finally made com-
mercial some fourteen
years later
