nent of this view was Linus
Pauling (see 1931), who, be-
ginning in 1970, recom-
mended massive doses of
vitamin C (ascorbic acid)
for health. His views seem
not to be accepted by most
biochemists, but Paulingâ€™s
voice is not one that can be
lightly ignored.

Fiber Optics

Since current electricity
had come into use (see 1800
and 1831), metallic wires,
especially those of copper,
had been used to conduct
the current wherever it was
needed.

By 1970 techniques
had been developed to con-
duct light by means of fine,
very clear glass fibers. The
fibers were coated with
plastic or with a second
type of glass so chosen that
any light that tended to
travel out of the fiber into
the coating would be to-
tally reflected. In this way,
light could follow the fiber
around curves and corners.
With the use of lasers, such
light could be as easily
modulated as electric cur-
rents, so that sound waves
could be converted into
light of varying amplitude
and, at the other end, recon-
verted into sound waves.

Fiber optics, by replac-
ing expensive copper with
cheap glass and by using
the tiny waves of light,

 

which can carry enormous
amounts of information,
was instantly seen as hav-
ing the potential of greatly
extending communication
by telephone.

Scanning
Electron
Microscope

In an ordinary electron mi-
croscope (see 1932), an elec-
tron beam, in a vacuum,
passes through the sample
being studied and leaves an
imprint on the recording
device beyond. The sample
must be very thin if this is
to work.

If a low-energy beam of
electrons is used, however,
it can scan the surface of a
sample much as an electron
beam scans the picture
tube of a television set. The
electrons will induce the
surface to emit electrons of
its own, and these induced
electrons can be detected.

Such a scanning elec-
tron microscope produces a
three-dimensional effect
that gives more informa-
tion about the surface and
produces still greater mag-
nifications than an ordi-
nary electron microscope
can do. In some cases it can
even show the position of
individual atoms.

The first practical scan-
ning electron microscope
was built in 1970 by the

British-born American
physicist Albert Victor
Crewe.

Planetary Soft
Landing

On August 17, 1970, the So-
viet Union launched Venera
7, a Venus probe that
reached the planet on De-
cember 15. An instrument
package was dropped into
the atmosphere and made a
soft landing. This was the
first soft landing of any
human-made object on
another planet. The instru-
ments sent back informa-
tion about the atmosphere
and surface for 23 minutes
before the extreme condi-
tions of temperature and
pressure destroyed it.

In 1970 the Soviet
Moon probe Lunik 17
landed without a crew on
the Moon and returned
safely to Earth. China and
Japan each launched Moon
rockets of their own in
1970.

Apollo XIII

A near disaster in space
took place in 1970 when
Apollo X111, en route to the
Moon, underwent a loss in
oxygen in the main cham-
ber. The three astronauts
crowded into the lunar
module and maneuvered
their way safely back to
