to suppose that hormones
were involved and that, like
the organs whose develop-
ment they controlled, they
were similar but different
in the two sexes.

In 1929 the American
biochemist Edward Adel-
bert Doisy (1893-1986)
and, working indepen-
dently, the German chemist
Adolf Friedrich Butenandt
(b. 1903) isolated a female
sex hormone, which came
to be called estrone, from
the Greek word for “sexual
heat.”

Intrinsic Factor

Minot and Murphy had
found that some vitamin in
liver relieved pernicious
anemia (see 1926). The
American physiologist Wil-
liam Bosworth Castle (b.
1897) noted that although
diet could prevent perni-
cious anemia from devel-
oping in most patients, it
did not cure the few who ac-
tually developed the dis-
ease. He reasoned that, ifa
vitamin was involved,
those who had trouble ab-
sorbing it even when it was
present in the diet were the
ones who came down with
pernicious anemia.

Since patients with
pernicious anemia had a
characteristic lack of
hydrochloric acid in their

gastric juice, Castle sug-
gested, in 1929, that it was
some component of normal
gastric juice that brought
about the absorption of the
antipernicious-anemia vita-
min. He called that missing
component intrinsic factor.

Electroen-
cephalography

Einthoven had developed
methods for detecting the
rise and fall of electric po-
tentials involved in the
heartbeat and devised the
electrocardiogram (see
1903).

The German psychia-
trist Hans Berger (1873—
1941) thought the same
might be done for the
brain. During the 1920s he
devised a system of elec-
trodes that, when applied
to the skull and connected
to an oscillograph, would
give a recording of the
rhythmic shifting of elec-
tric potentials commonly
called brain waves.

In 1929 he published
his results, describing alpha
waves and beta waves. In
this way, electroencephalog-
raphy (Greek for “the writ-
ing of brain electricity")
was developed. It offered a
technique for the diagnosis
of such serious brain disor-
ders as tumors and epi-

lepsy.

Cardiac
Catheter

A German surgeon, Werner
Theodor Otto Forssmann
(1904-1979), was the first
to work out a practical sys-
tem of cardiac catheteriza-
tion. He inserted a catheter
(a long, thin, flexible rod
that was opaque to X rays)
into a vein in his own
elbow and pushed it along
the vein until it reached the
heart. This made it possible
to study the structure and
function of an ailing heart
and to make accurate diag-
noses without the necessity
of exploratory surgery.

The technique was not
used clinically for over a de-
cade, but Forssmann was
awarded a share of the
Nobel Prize for physiology
and medicine in 1956.

Child
Development

By 1929 the Swiss psycholo-
gist Jean Piaget (1896—
1980) had worked out his
observations on child devel-
opment. By observing and
asking questions, he

learned much. He also de-
veloped what he called con-
servation tasks: he made
changes in simple objects
and studied whether chil-
dren could tell what had
