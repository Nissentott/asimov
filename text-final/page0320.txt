Nearly a century be-
fore, the Italian mathemati-
cian Girolamo Saccheri
(1667—1733) had been
struck with the idea of be-
ginning by supposing that
the axiom was not true. He
could then proceed to build
a geometry on that basis
and, sooner or later, arrive
at a contradiction. He
could then conclude that
the axiom was true. That
having been proved, it
would no longer be viewed
as an axiom.

However, he could find
no contradiction, and this
made him so uncomfort-
able that he imagined he
had found a contradiction
and, in 1733, published a
book entitled Euclid Cleared
of Every Flaw, in which he
claimed he had proved the
axiom—but hadn't.

Finally, in 1826, a Rus-
sian mathematician, Niko-
lay Ivanovich Lobachevsky
(1792-1856), got onto the
same track, but he went far-
ther. The axiom, he de-

 

 

cided, was not an axiom
because it was not needed;
geometry could be made
self-consistent without it.
He showed that if one
began with an axiom that
stated “Through a given
point, not on a given line,
any number of lines can be
drawn parallel to a given
line," then that and the re-
maining axioms of Euclid
could be used to draw up a
new “‘non-Euclidean” ge-
ometry. It would be differ-
ent from the ordinary kind,
but it would be self-consis-
tent

Lobachevsky published
his ideas in 1829 and was
first in the field. A Hungar-
ian mathematician, Janos
Bolyai (1802-1860), had as
early as 1823 worked out
the same non-Euclidean ge-
ometry. However, his publi-
cation was delayed till
1832, so Lobachevsky got
the credit.

Gauss (see 1797) had
actually worked out the
idea of non-Euclidean ge-

ometry as early as 1816 but
had lacked the courage to
publish it.

Bromine

Courtois had discovered io-
dine in seaweed fifteen
years before (see 1811). The
French chemist Antoine-Jé-
rome Balard (1802—1876),
also working with seaweed,
found that at times he ob-
tained a brown substance
in solution in the liquid he
was using to dissolve the
ashes of the seaweed. In
1826 he tracked this color
to a substance that had
properties apparently just
midway between those of
chlorine and iodine. For a
while he thought he had a
compound of those two ele-
ments, but further investi-
gation convinced him he
had a new element, which
he called bromine, from the
Greek word for “smell,” be-
cause of its strong odor.
