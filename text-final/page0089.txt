Windmills

The chief source of inani-
mate power continued to
be the waterwheel. Unfortu-
nately, the waterwheel only
worked where a rapidly
flowing stream existed, or
where a stream could be
dammed to produce a wa-
terfall that would turn the
wheel. What was needed
was a source of inanimate
energy not so constrained
Moving air can turn a
vaned wheel as well as mov-
ing water can, and its force

 

was already well under-

stood in connection with
sailing vessels. What's
more, moving air exists
everywhere. The earliest
windmills were developed
in Persia about 700, and re
turning Crusaders brought
back word of these devices
The first windmill was
built in France in 1180 and
windmills quickly spread
over western Europe. The
wheels in the Middle East
had usually been hori
zontal, but those in Europe
were made vertical. The

 

wheels could be turnec

that they would catch thi

wind from whichever ¢

 

tion it blew, and eventually
they were so designed that
the force of the wind itself
