700 B.C.

 

Aqueducts

As cities grew, supplying
what was needed to so
many people so densely
packed together became a
problem. Air itself, the
most immediate and press-
ing necessity, was available
everywhere more or less
(though the use of fires in
every house could fill that

air with unpleasant smoke).

Water was more of a

problem. Cities are usually
built where there is a water
supply, but as they grow,
the water supply may be-
come insufficient. Wells
within the city limits or
just outside may not supply
enough. [t may then be-
come necessary to letch
water from some distance,
either through canals or
tunnels or along artificial
structures of masonry.
These last are called ag-

weducts (from Latin words
meaning "a drawing off of
water‚Äù) and by 700 B.c.,
Sennacherib, who was king
of Assyria from 704 to 681
B.C., had an aqueduct con-
structed that would bring
water into his capital,
Nineveh. At about the same
time, Hezekiah, king of
Judah from about 715 1o
about 686 B.c., built an ag-
ueduct to supply Jerusalem
with water.
