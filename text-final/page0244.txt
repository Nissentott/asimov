phlogiston, but through the
combination of the sub-
stance that was burning or
rusting with some portion
of the air. This killed the
phlogiston theory, although
a few important chemists
continued to accept phlogis-
ton for some decades
longer.

Diamond

One of the substances that
Lavoisier burned (see
above) was a diamond. He
and some other chemists in-
vested in one, placed it in a
closed vessel, and then fo-
cused sunlight on it with a
magnifying glass. The dia-
mond, when it grew hot
enough, simply disap-

peared, and carbon dioxide
appeared within the vessel.
The conclusion was that di-
amond consisted of carbon
and, despite appearances,
was chemically very closely
related to coal.

Nitrogen

At this time it was known
that ordinary air supported
combustion and animal life
and that carbon dioxide did
not. If candles were burned
in an enclosed volume of
air until no further burning
was possible, had all the air
become carbon dioxide?
Black (see 1754) asked
a student of his, the British
chemist Daniel Rutherford
(1749-1819), to investigate

the matter. In 1772 Ruther-
ford, having burned a can-
dle to extinction in a closed
container, absorbed all the
carbon dioxide that had
been produced by combin-
ing it with certain chemi-
cals. He found that there
was still a great deal of gas
left that was not carbon di-
oxide, which also sup-
ported neither combustion
nor animal life. He had, in
this way, discovered a new
gas that eventually came to
be called nitrogen. This is
from the Greek, meaning
“niter producer,” since
niter, a mineral properly
called potassium nitrate,
contains nitrogen.

Antarctic Circle

The Arctic Circle was first
crossed at sea by Ottar (see
870), though unnamed
primitives must surely
have ventured past it on

land earlier. However, the
Arctic Circle passes
through northern North
America, Europe, and Asia,
and once the glaciers had
retreated, the line was open
to venturesome hunters.

The Antarctic Circle,
however, lies far to the
south of any populated
area. The closest is Tierra
del Fuego at the southern
tip of South America,
which even at its most
