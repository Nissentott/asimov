This lowering is in propor-
tion to the quantity of the
substance dissolved.

For different sub-
stances, the amount of low-
ering depends on the
number of molecules pres-
ent. If substance A has mol-
ecules only half the mass of
substance B’s molecules,
and if equal masses of both
are dissolved in separate
quantities of water, there
will be twice as many mole-
cules of the half-sized A in
solution as of the full-sized
B. Substance A will there-
fore be more effective in
lowering the freezing point
of water than substance B.

That goes for sub-
stances that don't conduct
electric current in solution
(nonelectrolytes). For sub-
stances that do conduct
electric current (electro-
Iytes), the situation is differ-
ent. For instance, when
sodium chloride is dis-
solved in water, one can cal-
culate how many of its
molecules are in solution
and therefore how far the
freezing point will be de-
pressed. However, the freez-
ing point is depressed twice
as much as the calculated
figure. The same is true for
potassium bromide and so-
dium nitrate. With sub-
stances like barium
chloride and sodium sul-
fate, the depression of the
freezing point is three
times what is calculated.

 

A Swedish chemistry
student, Svante August
Arrhenius (1859-1927), de-
cided that the logical way
to explain this was to sup-
pose that sodium chloride
molecules broke up into
two fragments of opposite
electrical charge (such frag-
ments are called ions, a
word first used by Faraday
—see 1821). The ions car-
ried the current, and since
there were twice as many
particles as there would
have been if the molecule
had remained intact, this
accounted for the doubled
depression of the freezing
point. In the same way, bar-
ium chloride must break up
into three ions, and so on.

In 1884 Arrhenius pre-
sented his theory of ionic
dissociation as his Ph.D.
thesis. It was not greeted
with enthusiasm, for chem-
ists had assumed for a cen-
tury that atoms were
featureless, indestructible,
and unchanging. The
thought of atoms carrying
electric charges lent them
features and a structure,
and that was hard to ac-
cept. However, Arrhenius’s
theory made sense in every
other way, so he was given
a passing grade—but the
lowest possible one. In
1903, when key discoveries
had been made concerning
the atom’s structure, this
same thesis obtained for
Arrhenius a Nobel Prize.

Sugar Structure

Though sugars had been
studied throughout the
nineteenth century, and
though their atomic con-
tent was more or less
known, the actual three-
dimensional arrangement
of the atoms was not
known. The work of van’t
Hoff, ten years before, had
shown the importance of
the three-dimensional
arrangement of atoms in
a molecule and the way
this could be responsible
for optical activity (see
1874).

In a long series of ex-
periments beginning in
1884, the German chemist
Emil Hermann Fischer
(1852—1919) isolated pure
sugars and studied their
structures. He showed that
the best-known sugars con-
tained six carbon atoms
and could exist in sixteen
varieties, depending on
how the carbon bonds were
arranged. Each different ar-
rangement was reflected in
the way the plane of light
polarization was twisted.

Fischer showed that
there were two series of sug-
ars, mirror images of each
other, which he called the
D-series and the L-series. He
had to pick which mirror
image belonged to which
method of writing the for-
mula, and he did so arbi-
trarily. He had a fifty-fifty
