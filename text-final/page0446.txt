Neuron Theory

Of all the cells, the nerve
cells seem most complex,
and of all the organs and
systems of organs, the
brain and nervous system
seem most complex. More-
over, of all the parts of a
human body, the brain and
nervous system are, or
should be, the most inter-
esting, since it is they that
make us human.
Waldeyer-Hartz (see
1888) was the first to main-
tain that the nervous sys-
tem was built out of
separate cells and their deli-
cate extensions. The deli-
cate extensions, he pointed
out, approached each other
closely but did not actually
meet, much less join, so
that the nerve cells re-
mained separate. He called
the nerve cells neurons, and
his thesis that the nervous
em is composed of sepa-

 

 

rate neurans is the neuron
theory.

An Italian histologist,
Camillo Golgi (1843 or
1844-1926), fifteen years
before, had devised a sys-
tem of staining with silver
compounds that brought
out the structure of neurons
in fine detail. Using this
stain he could demonstrate
that Waldeyer-Hartz's
views were correct. He
could show that fine pro-
cesses did indeed issue
from the neurons and that
from one neuron ap-
proached but did not touch
those of neighboring neu-
rons. The tiny gaps be-
tween one neuron and the
next are called synapses
(oddly enough, from a
Greek word meaning
“union,” which they ap-
peared to be at a casual
glance but were not in actu-
ality).

A Spanish histologist,

 

Santiago Ramoén y Cajal
(1852-1934), improved on
Golgi’s stain, and by 1889
had worked out the cellular
structure of the brain and
spinal cord in detail, firmly
establishing the neuron the-
ory

 

For their work on the
neuron theory, Golgi and
Ramon y Cajal shared the
Nobel Prize in medicine
and physiology in 1906.

The modernization of
Japan included an orienta-
tion of Japanese scholars to-
ward western science, for
which they showed a ready
aptitude. (This is true of
scholars in all nations.
There is no such thing as
“western” science in the
sense that it can only come
out of western minds.)
Thus, a Japanese bacte-
riologist, Shibasaburo Kita-
