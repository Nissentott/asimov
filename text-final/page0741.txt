Ozone Hole

A hole in the ozone layer
over the Antarctic was de-
tected by the British Ant-
arctic survey, and the
ozone concentration else-
where was abnormally low,
This was taken as dis-
turbing confirmation of the
deleterious effect of chloro-
fluorocarbons on ozone (see
1974).

Pluto and
Charon

The orbit of Charon about
Pluto is so oriented that, at
perihelion and aphelion, it

alternately eclipses Pluto
and is eclipsed by it for a pe-
riod of some years. Natu-
rally, this is much more
important at perihelion,
when Pluto is considerably
nearer to us than at aph-
elion.

In 1985 Charon, which
had been discovered near
perihelion (see 1978), began
to move in front of Pluto on
the way to moving behind
it. By studying the light of
Pluto alone, when Charon
was behind it, and the light
from both bodies, when
Charon was in front of it
but not covering all of it,
something could be de-
duced about the surfaces of
the two bodies.

Thus, whereas Plutoâ€™s
surface is frozen methane,
the smaller Charon cannot
hold on to methane. Its sur-
face is frozen water.
