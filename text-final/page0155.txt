In particular, Helmont
studied the gas produced
by burning wood. He called
this gas sylvestre (wood
gas), but we know it as car-
bon dioxide.

Planetary Tables

If Kepler’s elliptical plane-
tary orbits (see 1609) really
presented an advance over
the circular orbits of both
Prolemy and Copernicus,
then using them ought to re-
sult in improved planetary
tables.

Kepler spent some
years working out new ta-
bles on the basis of his ellip-
tical orbits, using Napier's
logarithms (see 1614) in his
calculations—the first im-
portant scientific use of the

new technique, In 1627
they were published as the
Rudolphine Tables, in mem-
ory of Rudolf IT (1552-
1612), who had become
Holy Roman Emperor in
1576 and who had sup-
pul'lcd KL'plL'l'.
They were in

  

:d the
best tables of planetary mo-
tions yet prepared. The pub-
lication included tables of
logarithms and a star map
based on the work of Tycho
and expanded by Kepler
include over a thousand
