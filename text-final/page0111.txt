While the Portuguese were
working their way around
Africa, there were those
who felt that the same re-
sult could be achieved an-
other way. Since it was
understood that the Earth
was spherical, it was bound
to occur to people that it
might be circumnavigated
and that the Far East could
be reached by sailing west.
The concept was a sim
ple one and, in fact, it had
been suggested by Roger
Bacon (see 1249) two centu-
ries before. What stopped

people from making the ef-
fort was the thought that
between the western coast
of Europe and the eastern
coast of Asia might be a
vast stretch of ocean that
the ships of the day could
not be expected to manag
If Eratosthenes was
correct and the Earth was
25,000 miles in circumfer:
ence (see 240 B.c.), then be
tween Europe and Asia
were some 12,000 miles of
unbroken sea. Yet other au
thorities, such as Ptole
(see 140), had thought the
Earth was smaller than
that, and Marco Polo had

Combining a smaller
Earth with a more east-

Columbus (14511506

ward trip from Europe to
Asia was a matter of only
3,000 miles. He the
