Airplane

Once Lilienthal had de-
vised his gliders (see 1853),
it seemed natural to think
of putting an internal-com-
bustion engine on a glider
as Zeppelin had done for
balloons (see 1900). The
‘ American astronomer Sam-
\ uel Pierpont Langley
(1834—1906) made the at-
tempt on three separate oc-
casions between 1897 and
1903 and almost succeeded
but not quite.

Then two brothers, Or-
ville (1871-1948) and Wil-
bur (1867—-1912) Wright
took up the task. They
made shrewd corrections in
design and invented “aile-
rons,” movable wing tips
that enabled the pilot to
control the plane. In addi-
tion, they built a crude
wind tunnel to test their
models, and they designed
new engines of unprece-
dented lightness for the
power they could deliver.

On December 13, 1903,
at Kitty Hawk, North Caro-
lina, Orville Wright made
the first powered flight in a
| heavier-than-air machine.
It remained in the air for al-

most a minute and covered
850 feet. Such devices soon
came to be called airplanes.

Space Flight

Oddly enough, in the same
year that air flight became
a reality, space flight began
to receive true scientific at-
tention.

In 1903 a Russian phys-
icist, Konstantin Eduardov-
ich Tsiolkovsky (1857—
1935), began a series of arti-
cles for an aviation maga-
zine in which he went into
the theory of rocketry quite
thoroughly. He wrote of
space suits, satellites, and
the colonization of the solar
system. He was the first to
suggest the possibility of a
space station.

Electrocardio-
gram

That muscles gave rise to
tiny electric potentials had
been known since Galvani's
time (see 1780). It seemed
natural to suppose, then,
that the heart, beating
rhythmically, might give
rise to rhythmic electric po-

tentials. Perhaps a depar-
ture from the natural
rhythm might be used to
diagnose pathological con-
ditions before they could
be discovered in any

other way. The problem
was to detect the small
currents with sufficient
accuracy.

In 1903 a Dutch physi-
ologist, Willem Einthoven
(1860-1927), developed the
first string galvanometer.
This consisted of a delicate
conducting thread
stretched across a magnetic
field. A current flowing
through the thread would
cause it to deviate at right
angles to the direction of
the magnetic lines of force.
The delicacy of the device
was sulficient to make it
possible to record the vary-
ing electrical potentials of
the heart.

The result was an elec-
trocardiogram. The abbrevi-
ation is EKG because in
German -cardio- is spelled
with a k. For the develop-
ment of electrocardiogra-
phy, Einthoven was
awarded the Nobel Prize
for medicine and physiol-
ogy in 1924,
