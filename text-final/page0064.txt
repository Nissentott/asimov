tively distant one; this is
called parallax. The smaller
the shift with a fixed
change of position, the
greater the distance to the
nearer object. Once he had
measured the parallax of
the Moon, he could deter-
mine by trigonometry the
distance of the Moon, at
least in terms of the
Earth's size. In this way
Hipparchus calculated

that the Moon was at a
distance equal to

In 134 B.c. Hipparchus (see
150 B.c.) observed a star in
the constellation Scorpio of
which he could find no re-
cord in previous observa-
tions. This was a serious
matter, for the heavens
were supposed to be eternal
and changeless. Was it
really a new star, or had
Hipparchus simply over-
looked it earlier?

If, as Eratosthenes had
determined, Earth had a
circumference of 25,000
miles, it had to have a diam-
eter of 8,000 miles. That
meant that the Moon was
30 x 8,000 miles, or
240,000 miles away (which
is very nearly correct).
That's nearly a quarter of a
million miles away, and yet
the Moon was well known
to be the nearest of the heav-
enly bodies.

map so that from then on
any astronomer sighting a
star that seemed new could
check it against the map. In
order to make his map, he
plotted the position of each
star according to its lati-
tude and longitude, as Eu-
doxus had done (see 350
B.C., Star Maps). Hippar-
chus included over a thou-
sand stars, and both in
quantity and in accuracy it
was a far better map than
anything attempted before.
What's more, it occurred to

This was the first indi-
cation that the Universe
was far larger than had
been thought, but it was
also a dead end. Parallaxes
grow smaller as objects
grow more distant, and the
Moon is the only object
close enough to give a mea-
surable parallax to the un-
aided eye.

system of latitude and lon-
gitude to maps of the
Earth. That has been done
ever since.

In the course of prepar-
ing his map, Hipparchus
compared the locations of
stars with those recorded
by earlier astronomers and
discovered a uniform shift
of all the stars from west to
east, at a rate that would
bring them completely
around the sky in 26,700
years. Because it meant
