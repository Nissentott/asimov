luminosity), or it may be un-
usually close to us so that it
appears bright even though
it has low luminosity.

The Danish astronomer
Ejnar Hertzsprung (1873—
1967) suggested that if a
star's distance were known,
one could calculate what
magnitude it would have if
it were some standard dis-
tance away. The distance
chosen was 10 parsecs, or
32.6 light-years. The bright-
ness of the star at that dis-
tance would then be its
absolute magnitude. Thus, if
our Sun were 10 parsecs
away from us, it would
seem to have a magnitude
of 4.86 (a rather dim star),
and that would be its abso-
lute magnitude.

In studying the abso-
lute magnitude of various
stars, Hertzsprung could
calculate their relative
luminosities. In 1905 he
noticed that there were
two kinds of red stars: red
stars with very high lumi-
nosity (which we now call
red giants) and red stars
with very low luminosity
(which we now call red
dwarfs).

The most interesting
aspect of the findings was
that there were no red stars
of intermediate luminosity.
Hertzsprung's report did
not atiract much attention
at first (he published it in a
journal of photography),

but it represented the first
step toward understanding
the evolution of stars.

Planetesimal
Hypothesis

Laplace’s nebular hypothe-
sis of the origin of the Solar
System (see 1796) had held
sway for a century, even
though astronomers had
grown steadily more dubi-
ous about it. It turned out
that most of the angular
momentum in the Solar
System was concentrated
in the planets. (Jupiter
alone has 60 percent of all
the angular momentum in
the Solar System because
of its rapid rotation and the
whirling of its major satel-
lites.) There seemed no way
in which the Solar System
could have been formed by
the slow condensation of a
vast nebula without virtu-
ally all the angular momen-
tum ending up at the core
—in the body that became
the Sun.

Despite this concern,
no alternate hypothesis was
advanced till the American
geologist Thomas
Chrowder Chamberlin
(1843-1928) and the Ameri-
can astronomer Forest Ray
Moulton (1872-1952) came
along with one.

Chamberlin had been
working on it since 1900
and, in 1905, he and Moul-

ton advanced the sugges-
tion that the Solar System
began when the Sun, al-
ready in existence, passed
near another star. The grav-
itational influence of each
star tore gouts of matter
out of the other, and the
gravitational pulls of the
stars as they separated

gave those gouts of matter
a sidewise yank so that they
became planets with high
angular momentum.

In the process of planet
formation, the gouts of
solar matter condensed
into small solid pieces
called planetesimals, and
these came together little by
little to form planets. This
planetesimal hypothesis re-
tained a certain popularity
for nearly half a century.

If it were true, it would
mean that there were very
few planetary systems in
the Universe, since the
close approach of two stars
is an excessively rare phe-
nomenon.
