tiny cloud. In this way he
determined that the pres-
ence of dust or of electri-
cally charged ions
encouraged the formation
of water droplets and there-
fore of clouds.

It occurred to Wilson
eventually that energetic
radiation would produce
ions as they spread through
the atmosphere. If he could
prepare air that was dust-
free, he could make it so
moist that water drops
would only be kept from
condensing by lack of the
dust that would serve as
condensation-seeds.

If an energetic particle
then passed through the
chamber, and if the cham-
ber was expanded, droplets
of water would form
around the ions produced
by the passage of the parti-
cle, and not only would the
presence of the particle be
detected but its route of
travel as well. If the cloud
chamber was then placed in
a magnetic field, the curva-
ture of the path of the parti-
cle would indicate the
nature of its electric charge
and give information con-
cerning its mass. It would
also indicate collisions of
particles with molecules
and with other particles
and offer a guide to events
that took place before and
after the collision.

Wilson perfected his
cloud chamber in 1911 and

it quickly became an im-
portant adjunct of nuclear
research. For this work,
Wilson was awarded a
Nobel Prize in physics in
1927Â°

Electron Charge

The ratio of the electric
charge of the electron to its
mass had been worked out
and compared with that of
ordinary ions by Thomson
(see 1897). The size of the
electric charge in an abso-
lute sense, however, was
not known.

The American physicist
Raobert Andrews Millikan
(1868-1953) tackled the
job. Beginning in 1906, he
had followed the course of
tiny electrically charged
water droplets falling
through air, under the in-
fluence of gravity, against
the pull of a charged plate
above. The evaporation of
the water confused the re-
sults, and in 1911 he began
to use tiny oil droplets in-
stead.

Every once in a while,
such an oil droplet
attached itself to an ion,
which Millikan produced
by passing X rays through
the chamber. With the ion
added, the effect of the
charged plate above was
suddenly strengthened and
the droplet would fall more
slowly or perhaps even rise.
The minimum change in
motion was due, Millikan

felt, to the addition of a sin-
gle electronic charge. By
balancing the effects of the
electromagnetic attraction
upward and the gravita-
tional attraction down-
ward, both before and after
such an addition, Millikan
was able to calculate the
charge on a single electron.
The figure we now have is
sixteen-quintillionths of a
coulomb.

For this work, Millikan
was awarded the Nobel
Prize in physics in 1923.

Cosmic Rays

One way to detect the pres-
ence of energetic radiation
is by the use of a gold-leaf
electroscope. This device
consists of two pieces of
gold leaf, joined at the
upper end, and contained
in a sealed jar. They can be
electrically charged from
the outside, and since both
leaves have the same
charge, they repel each
other, forming an inverted
V. Any energetic radiation
entering the jar produces
ions, which will carry off
the electric charge and
allow the gold leaves to
come together slowly.
There seemed no way
of keeping the leaves per-
manently apart, however,
even in the absence of any
known source of energetic
radiation. Some radiation
was apparently coming
from an unknown source.
