higher than ever at a spot
beyond the red end of the
spectrum. The region was
called infrared (below the
red).

How to interpret the re-
gion was not readily appar-
ent. The first impression
was that the Sun delivered
heat rays as well as light
rays and that heat rays re-
fracted to a lesser extent
than light rays. A half-cen-
tury passed before it was es-
tablished that infrared
radiation had all the prop-
erties of light waves except
that it didn’t affect the ret-
ina of the eye in such a way
as to produce a sensation of
light.

Gas Lighting
In preparing charcoal from
wood or coke from coal, lit-
tle attention was paid to
the materials that were
heated and burned away.
In 1792, however, a British
inventor, William Murdock
(1754-1839), began to col-
lect the gases obtained by
heating wood, peat, and
coal, and found that they
were inflammable. Being
gases, they could be piped
from place to place easily;
could be easily lit and eas-
ily extinguished.

By 1800, Murdock had
set up an experimental gas
light, using coal gas. It was
not long before gas lighting

was well established, and
the large cities of the indus-
trial nations and the better-
off homes were lit by
flaring gas jets for most of a
century. With better light-
ing by night, travel was
safer, the crime rate fell,
and the evening meal,
rather than the midday
meal, became the im-
portant social occasion of
the day.

Nitrous oxide

New gases continued to be
discovered. A British chem-
ist, Humphry Davy (1778—
1829), discovered nitrous
oxide in 1800. It was his
rather risky habit to smell
new gases and try to study
the effects on the human
body of breathing them. It
turned out that nitrous
oxide, on being breathed,
gave one a giddy, intoxi-
cated feeling and made one
suggestible, so that one
would laugh or weep im-
moderately or make other
emotional displays. (The
gas is still called laughing
gas today.)

Davy reported that
under the influence of the
gas he felt no pain and sug-
gested it be used as an anes-
thetic. It was indeed the
first true chemical anesthe-
tic and was often so used in
dentistry. It also became a
fad of the day, and some

people with nothing better
to do would sit about a
bowl of it and breathe it in
order to experience the ef-
fects.

Tissues

The French physician
Marie Francois Xavier
Bichat (1771-1802) was
notable for the many
postmortems he conducted
in his very short profes-
sional life. His careful ob-
servations (without a
microscope) showed him
that the various organs
were built up out of a mix-
ture of different types of
simpler structures, each of
which might occur in many
different organs. Because
these structures were usu-
ally flat and delicately thin,
they were called tissues.

In 1800 he published a
book called Treatise on
Membranes in which he
listed and carefully de-
scribed twenty-one differ-
ent types of tissues. He is
for this reason considered
the founder of the science of
histology (the study of tis-
sues).
