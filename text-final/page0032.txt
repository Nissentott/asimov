Law

Human beings must always
have had customs that they
followed assiduously, even
when enforcement was not
an issue,

In a simple society, cus-
tom is, in fact, enough. Ev-
eryone knows what
behavior is expected, and
conforms almost automati-
cally. If not, there is social
ostracism, and this is suffi-
ciently undesirable to en-
force the rule of custom.

As a society grows
more complex, however,
there are more varieties of
behavior that must be con-
trolled and regulated, more
perplexing conditions,
more complicated ques-
tions, more puzzling inter-
actions. It becomes difficult
to remember all the rules,
and the suspicion is sure to
arise that powerful people
make up or alter rules to
suit themselves. The de-
mand, then, is for the rules
of society to be put in writ-
ing, so that all can see for

  

themselves what they are,
and so that they cannot be
unfairly or arbitrarily
twisted or modified.

We don't know when
the first laws were written
down, but the first rela-
tively complete law code
that we still have was estab-
lished by Hammurabi, king
of Babylon (reigned 1792—
1750 B.c.), who founded a
rather short-lived Babylo-
nian Empire in the Tigris-
Euphrates valley, one that
succeeded the Akkadian
Empire. (After this time, the
people of the valley were re-
ferred to as Babylonians for
nearly two millennia.)

Perhaps about 1775
B.C., Hammurabi had his
law code inscribed on an
8-foot-high stone pillar of
hard diorite. It was clearly
intended to be permanent,
and it was, for we still have
it

The stele is topped by a
relief that shows Hammu-
rabi standing before the
Sun-god, Shamash. (It was
usual in ancient times to

 

suppose that a law code
was received by a king
from a god. That tended to
lend the law authority.
Thus, Moses received the
Jewish law code from God
on Mount Sinai, according
to the Bible.)

Down along the face of
the stele are twenty-one col-
umns of finely written cune-
iform, outlining nearly
three hundred laws that
were to govern people’s ac-
tions and guide the king
and his officials in dispens-
ing justice.

The stele originally
stood in the town of Sippar,
some 30 miles upstream
from Babylon, but an invad-
ing Elamite force plun-
dered the city and carried
away the stele as spoil. It re-
mained in Elam’s capital,
Susa, thereafter and was
still there, in Susa’s ruins,
in 1901, when a French ar-
chaeologist, Jacques Jean
Marie de Morgan (1857—
1924), found it and brought
it back to Europe.
