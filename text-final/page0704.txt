1967

 

Pulsars

For some years there had
been indications of radio
sources in the sky that
changed intensity after
brief intervals, but radio
telescopes at that time
were not designed to catch
such brief "twinkles."

Then, in Great Britain,
the British astronomer An-
thony Hewish (b. 1924) su-
pervised the construction of
a device with 2,048 sepa-
rate receivers spread out in
an array that covered an
area of nearly 3 acres. This
was designed to detect brief
changes in microwave in-
tensities.

In July 1967 the array
was put to work, and
within a month a graduate
student, Jocelyn Bell, had
detected bursts of micro-
waves from a place midway
between Vega and Altair.
The bursts were astonish-
ingly brief, lasting only a
thirtieth of a second. Even
more astonishing, they fol-
lowed one another with re-
markable regularity—at
intervals that were finally
measured as 1.33730109
seconds.

This object was eventu-
ally called a pulsating star,
a phrase quickly abbrevi-
ated to pulsar,

Eventually hundreds of
pulsars were located. Hew-
ish was awarded a share of
the Nobel Prize for physics
in 1974.

Venus’s
Atmosphere

The Soviet Union contin-
ued to send out Venus
probes that didn’t last long
because of the fearsome
temperature and pressure
of Venus's atmosphere.

By 1967 the probes had
made it clear that Venus's
atmosphere was about
ninety times as dense as
Earth's—far denser than
anyone had expected. That
atmosphere is about 96.6
percent carbon dioxide,
and virtually all the rest is
nitrogen. There is about as
much nitrogen in Venus's
atmosphere as in Earth'’s,
but it is dwarfed by the
overwhelming quantity of
carbon dioxide. The carbon
dioxide produces a runaway
greenhouse effect that
makes Venus the hottest
planet in the Solar System,
hotter even than Mercury.

Space
Casualties

The Space Age, now ten
years old, saw its first
human casualties. On Janu-
ary 27, 1967, three Ameri-
can astronauts died while
an Apollo capsule was
being tested on the ground.
They were Virgil Ivan (Gus)
Grissom (1926—1967), who
had orbited in Gemini 3 in
1965; Edward White, who
had been the first American
to take a spacewalk (see
1965), and Roger Bruce
Chalffee (1935-1967).

On April 24, 1967, the
Soviet spacecraft Soyuz
made its first flight, but dur-
ing the return to Earth, the
ship became tangled in its
parachute lines and the cos-
monaut, Vladimir Mikhay-
lovich Komarov (1927—
1967),who had piloted the
first multiperson spacecraft
(see 1964), died. He was the
first person to die in the
course of an actual space-
flight.
