had a small magnetic field,
about a hundredih as in-
tense as the Earth's. This is
puzzling, for Mercury does
not rotate quickly enough
to have a field, if current
theories are correct.

Formation of
the Moon

Over the course of the last
century, three different
types of suggestions had
been made about the origin
of the Moon. It was sug-
gested first that the Moon
was originally part of the
Earth and pulled away as a
result of centrifugal effect
when the primordial Earth
was spinning rapidly. How-
ever, Earth had never ro-
tated rapidly enough to
make such a pullaway pos-
sible.

Second was the
thought that Earth and
Moon had formed sepa-
rately from the same swirl
of planetesimals. But the
Earth and Moon should
then have much the same
chemical composition, and
they don’t. Earth, for in-
stance, has a large nickel-
iron core while the Moon
seems to have none at
all.

Third was the thought
that Earth and Moon were
formed from different
swirls of planetesimals, and
at some time in the past the

Earth captured the Moon.
But the mechanics of such
a Moon capture are difficult
to work out.

These seemed the only
three possibilities, and each
one was so flawed that it
looked as though the only
way out of the mess was to
decide that the Moon didn't
really exist.

In 1974, however, the
American astronomer Wil-
liam K. Hartmann sug-
gested a fourth alternative.
Suppose that in the early
days of the Solar System, a
planet the size of Mars
(about one-tenth the mass
of the Earth) had had a
glancing collision with
Earth. It would knock off
part of the Earth’s outer
layers, which would co-
alesce into the Moon, while
the colliding body coa-
lesced with Earth. The nick-
el-iron cores of Earth and
the colliding object would
merge, while the Moon,
formed from the outer lay-
ers of Earth, would lack
such a core.

The suggestion was
largely ignored, but eventu-
ally computer simulations
of such a collision made the
idea begin to look good. At
the moment, Hartmann's
suggestion is preferred to
any of the older ones.

Leda

The twelfth satellite of Jupi-
ter had been discovered
among its four outermast
satellites, circling at
an average distance of
14,000,000 miles from Jupi-
ter (see 1951). It was clear
that if a thirteenth satellite
existed, it would have to be
smaller and dimmer than
the others, for otherwise it
would already have been
discovered.

On September 10,
1974, the American astrono-
mer Charles T. Kowall did
detect a thirteenth Jovian
satellite. It was also part of
that outermost group,
which now numbered five.
This new satellite, eventu-
ally named Leda after one
of Zeus's (Jupiter's) many
loves in the Greek myths,
seemed to be no more than
5 miles across.

Freon and the
Ozone Layer

Freon, which had been in-
troduced by Midgley (see
1930), and similar com-
pounds had first been used
in air-conditioning and
later in spray cans. The
compounds contained chlo-
rine and [luorine atoms
attached to a carbon skele-
ton (chlorofluorocarbons)
and seemed absolutely safe.
As such chemicals were
