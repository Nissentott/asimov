this was done, he found
that the reflecting proper-
ties of the nickel had
changed.

Whereas the target had
contained many tiny crys-
tal surfaces before heating,
it contained just a few large
crystal surfaces afterward.
Davisson therefore carried
matters to a logical ex-
treme and, in 1927, pre-
pared a single nickel
crystal for use as a target.

Once that was done, he
found that an electron
beam was not only re-
fracted, but also diffracted
just as a beam of X rays
would be. Diffraction was a
characteristic property of
waves, so in this way the
wave aspect of electrons
was detected.

In 1927 the British
physicist George Paget
Thomson (1892-1975), the
son of J. J. Thomson, who
had discovered the electron
(see 1897), sent a beam of
fast electrons through thin
gold foil and also demon-
strated electron diffraction.

Thus de Broglie's the-
ory was amply confirmed,
and for doing so Davisson
and Thomson were awarded
shares in the Nobel Prize
for physics in 1937.

Speed of Light

In his last years, Michelson,
who had performed the
fateful Michelson-Morley

experiment (see 1887), grew
interested in measuring the
speed of light with new pre-
cision. In the California
mountains, he surveyed a
22-mile distance between
two mountain peaks to an
accuracy of less than an
inch. He made use of a spe-
cial eight-sided revolving
mirror to reflect a light
beam in the fashion used
by Foucault (see 1849).

In 1927 he obtained a
value of 199,798 kilometers
per second for the speed of
light. This was only about 6
kilometers per second
faster than the figure deter-
mined nowadays by much
more sophisticated equip-
ment.

Cosmic Egg

Friedmann had developed
the theoretical concept

of an expanding universe
(see 1917), and in 1927 the
Belgian astrophysicist
Georges-Henri Lemaitre
(1894-1966) drew what
seemed a natural conclu-
sion.

If the Universe was ex-
panding as time went for-
ward, then if we imagined
the situation reversed and
looked back in time, we
should see the Universe con-
tracting. (It would be as
though we had taken a film
of the expanding Universe
and were running it back-
ward.)

If we looked forward,

the Universe might well ex-
pand forever, but if we loock
backward, the contraction
had to be limited. Eventu-
ally, at a point far enough
back in time, all the matter
of the Universe would be
compressed into one rela-
tively small body, which
Lemaitre called the cosmic
egg.

This cosmic egg appar-
ently exploded in what
came to be called the big
bang and started the ex-
panding Universe that now
exists. Of course, Lemaitre
could offer no scientific ex-
planation of where the cos-
mic egg came from and just
how its explosion led to the
present Universe. Physicists
have been trying to work
that out ever since.

Electron Bonds

Lewis had viewed chemical
bonds as resulting from

the transfer or sharing of
electrons (see 1916). Now,
immediately after Schro-
dinger and Born had
worked out the mathemati-
cal underpinnings of quan-
tum mechanics (see 1926),
two German physicists,
Fritz Wolfgang London
(1900-1954) and Walter
Heitler (b. 1904), tried to
apply quantum mechanics
to chemical bonds. In 1927
they took the simplest case,
that of the hydrogen mole-
cule. It consisted of two hy-
drogen atoms, each
