 

cept of particle spin (see
1925), it had become clear
that something was wrong
with the proton-electron no-
tion of nuclear structure.
Protons and electrons both
had a spin of either +'2 or
— 4, If twenty-one such
spins, or in fact any odd
number of such spins, were
added up (regardless of the
distribution of pluses and
minuses), the total spin
should be one of the half-
integers: Y2, or 1'%, or 2%,
and so on. The actual mea-
sured spin of the nitrogen
nucleus, however, was an
integer. The nucleus, there-
fore, could not contain an
odd number of particles
but had to contain an even
number. There were other
nuclei that shared this
anomalous characteristic.

If the proton-electron
combination could be
counted as a single particle,
however, then the nitrogen
nucleus would contain
seven protons and seven
proton-electron combina-
tions, for fourteen particles
—an even number.

A proton-electron com-
bination would have the
mass of a proton but would
carry no electric charge. If
such a neutral particle ex-
isted, however, it would be
difficult to detect, for the
various devices for de-
tecting subatomic particles
all depended on the electric

charge these particles car-
ried.

In 1930 Bothe, who had
devised the coincidence
counter (see 1929), became
aware of strange radiations
emerging from beryllium
that had been exposed to
bombardment with alpha
particles, but he couldn't
tell what the radiation con-
sisted of.

In 1932, however, the
English physicist James
Chadwick (1891-1974) re-
peated the experiments and
maintained that the best
way of explaining the obser-
vations was to suppose that
the alpha particles knocked
neutral particles out of the
beryllium nucleus. These
particles could not be de-
tected directly, since they
lacked an electric charge,
but they succeeded in
knocking protons out of the
atomic nuclei in paraffin,
and those protons could be
detected. A radiation capa-
ble of ejecting protons must
consist of particles with a
mass in the proton range,
and a particle possessing
the mass of a proton and no
charge was just the thing to
represent a proton-electron
pair and yet be one particle
and not two. The new parti-
cle was called a neutron,
and it proved to be by far
the most useful particle for
initiating nuclear reactions.

For his discovery of the

203

neutron, Chadwick was
awarded the Nobel Prize
for physics in 1935.

Proton-
Neutron
Nucleus

As soon as the neutron was
discovered by Chadwick
(see above), Heisenberg (see
1925) pointed out that the
atomic nucleus must be
made up of protons and
neutrons rather than pro-
tons and electrons.

Thus the nitrogen nu-
cleus with a charge of +7
must contain seven pro-
tons. Since it had a mass of
14, it must also contain
seven neutrons. That would
mean fourteen particles al-
together, and fourteen par-
ticles, each with with a
spin of +'2 or — ', would
add up to a total spin that
was an integer no matter
how you distributed the
pluses and minuses. Given
a proton-neutron nucleus,
all nuclear spins turned out
to match what was ex-
pected, and all spin anoma-
lies disappeared.

What's more, the
proton-neutron picture
clearly explained the exis-
tence of isotopes. The nu-
clei of all atomns of oxygen,
for instance, must contain
eight protons, but the com-
mon oxygen-16 nucleus
