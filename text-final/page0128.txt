Homologies

Anyone can see that living
organisms can be grouped.
Dogs and wolves resemble

each other more than either

resemble rabbits, for in-
stance. Cats, lions, and ti-
gers resemble each other.
Sheep and goats resemble
each other. Insects have a
common resemblance that
separates them from nonin-
sects, and so on.

This might have given
rise to evtxlulionary no-
tions, that some basic dog-
like animal had given rise
to both dogs and wolves, as
an example. However, the
Bible described all animals
as being created simultane-
ously and separately, and it
is possible to argue that

God may just have decided
to create animals in groups
for his own purposes.

It would be more im-
pressive if similarities
could be found in more
widely diverse organisms,
similarities that were not
too ebvious to the eyes.
This was done by a French
naturalist, Pierre Belon
(1517-1564).

Francis I of France
(1494-1547) was engaged
in a prolonged struggle
with Charles I of Spain,
who was also the Emperor
Charles V. Francis was des-
perate enough to ally him-
self with the Ottoman
Empire, and in 1546 he
sent Belon on a diplo-
matic mission to the
Ottomans.

This gave Belon a
chance to study plant and
animal life in the eastern
Mediterranean and to com-
pare it with life in France.
He was the first to describe,
in writings he published in
1555, basic similarities (ho-
mologies) in the skeletons of
all vertebrates, from fish to
humans. Such details as
the number of bones in the
limbs were remarkably con-
stant from animal to ani-
mal, regardless of the
difference in outer appear-
ance.

This could not help but
encourage evolutionary
thought, although it was to
be three centuries before it
came to fruition.
