Steam
Locomotives

Richard Trevithick had
failed in his attempt to
make a commercial success
of the steam locomotive
(see 1804). Another English
inventor, George Stephen-
son (1781—1848), took ad-
vantage of improved steam
engines, however, and was
able to build a steam loco-
motive that worked ade-
quately. On September 17,
1825, one of his locomo-
tives pulled thirty-eight
cars at speeds of 12 to 16
miles an hour. For the first
time in the history of the
world, land transportation
at a rate faster than that of
a galloping horse was
clearly on the way to be-
coming possible.

Railroads quickly
began to knit nations to-
gether. It might be argued
that a nation like the
United States could not
have been held together but
for the fact that railroads
made all parts reasonably
accessible.

Aluminum

Though aluminum is more
common than iron (only ox-
ygen and silicon are com-

moner), it is extremely
difficult to break its hold on
other atoms.

@rsted, the first person
to demonstrate electromag-
netism (see 1820), was also
the first person to isolate
aluminum. For the pur-
pose, he made use of a still
more active element, po-
tassium, which could
wrench other atoms out of
aluminum’s grip. In 1825
he managed to obtain the
first bits of the metal.

The procedure for ob-
taining it was so difficult,
however, that aluminum re-
mained virtually a precious
metal for some sixty years,
until a cheap method for ob-
taining it in quantity could
be worked out.

Gastric
Digestion

On June 6, 1822, a nine-
teen-year-old Canadian,
Alexis St. Martin, was acci-
dentally shot in the side at
a frontier post in northern
Michigan. It was a close-
range shotgun blast and he
received a terrible wound.
An American army sur-
geon at the post, William
Beaumont (1785-1853),
treated him, and he recov-
ered completely except that

an opening (or fistula) re-
mained in his side. It was
nearly an inch across and it
led into his stomach.

Through this opening,
Beaumont, beginning in
May 1825, was able to ob-
serve the changes in the
stomach under different
conditions and to extract
samples of gastric juice,
which he sent all over the
world. It was like having
the benefits of a vivisection.
Beaumont's work served as
a source for much early in-
formation on the process of
digestion and increased in-
terest in the field.

Candles

Candles had been a source
of illumination for nearly
five thousand years, but the
most common type, tallow
candles, which were all

that people in ordinary cir-
cumstances could afford,
had their shortcomings. For
one thing, they smelled
bad.

The French chemist Mi-
chel-Eugéne Chevreul
(1786—1889) had studied
fats and worked out their
chemical nature. They were
combinations of glycerol
with fatty acids. Each glyc-
erol molecule could com-
bine with three fatty acids,
