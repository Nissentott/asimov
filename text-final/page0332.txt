borers that had to work the
land to produce food, until
finally, in a thoroughly in-
dustrialized nation such as
the United States, a work
force of 4 percent of the
whole suffices to grow food
for itself and for the re-
maining 96 percent, with
enough left over to export.

Celiulose

Having discovered diastase
the year before, Payen (see
1833) went on to study the
chemical composition of
wood. From wood he ob-
tained a substance that cer-

tainly wasn't starch but
that could be broken down
to glucose units as starch
could. Because he obtained
it from cell walls, he named
it cellulose.

Sugars like glucose,
and substances that can be
broken down into sugars,
are made up of carbon, hy-
drogen, and oxygen atoms,
with the hydrogen and oxy-
gen atoms in the ratio of 2
to 1, as in water. The notion
arose, therefore, that these
molecules consisted of car-
bon atoms to which water
molecules had been added.
For that reason they came

to be called carbohydrates
(watered carbon). The true
structure of carbohydrates,
it eventually turned out,
was much more complex
than that.

Until Payen'’s discov-
ery, carbohydrates had
been given ordinary names
such as cane sugar, grape
sugar, starch, and so on.
Now use of the -ose suffix,
as in cellulose, spread until
it was used for carbohy-
drates generally. Cane
sugar became sucrose,
grape sugar glucose, starch
amylose, and so on—at
least, to chemists.

Dry Ice

As Black had shown sev-
enty years earlier, energy is
consumed in converting a
liguid to a vapor (see 1762).
This means that if a liquid
is allowed to evaporate
under conditions where no
outside heat can enter the
system, the energy for the
vaporization must be ob-

 

tained from the liquid it-
self. As the liguid
evaporates, its temperature
therefore drops. (That is the
purpose of perspiration. As
it evaporates, the tempera-
ture of the skin drops and
we remain comfortable on
hot days. Increasing humid-
ity, which reduces the rate
of evaporation, makes us
uncomfortable.)

The use of such evapo-
ration to cool a liquid to
the point of its solidifica-
tion was demonstrated by
the French chemist C.S.A.
Thilorier in 1835. He began
with the method intro-
duced by Faraday to lig-
uefy gases (see 1823) but
made use of metal cylin-
ders because they were
stronger than glass and
