Special
Relativity

The Michelson-Morley ex-
periment (see 1887) was
still troublesome. The work
of FitzGerald (see 1892) and
Lorentz (see 1895) got rid of
the difficulty in a way, but
the notion of decrease of
distance and increase of
mass seemed to hang in the
air without an overall phys-
ical theory for support

The German-born phys-
icist Albert Einstein (1879—

1955) supplied that in 1905.

He began with the assump-
tion that the speed of light
in a vacuum would always
be the same, regardless of
the motion of the light
source relative to the ob-
server. This was what Mi-
chelson and Morley had
observed, but Einstein
maintained that he was un-
aware of the Michelson-
Morley results when he
worked out his theory
From this assumption
it was possible to deduce
length contraction and

 

 

mass increase with veloe-
ity. It was also possible to
deduce that the speed of
light in a vacuum was an
absolute speed limit and
that the rate of time-flow
would decrease with veloc-
ity.

This is Einstein's theory
