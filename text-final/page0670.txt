mass. The result was that,
among 40,000 particles,
they detected 60 antipro-
tons.

For this, Segré and
Chamberlain received the
Nobel Prize for physics in
1959.

Mendelevium

In 1955 Seaborg and his
group (see 1940) bom-
barded einsteinium, ele-
ment number 99, with
protons and formed a few
atoms of element 101. They
named this new element
mendelevium, after Mende-
leyev, who had first worked
out the periodic table (see
1869).

Synthetic
Diamonds

It had been known for
nearly two centuries that
diamonds were made up of
carbon atoms, as graphite
and coal were. It should be
possible, in theory, then, to
convert graphite into dia-
mond. However, carbon
atoms held each other so
tightly that very high tem-
peratures were required to
shake them loose, and the
high temperatures had to
be combined with very
high pressures in order to
force the atoms into the
more compact arrangement
of diamond.

Moissan thought he
had achieved the synthesis
of diamond from graphite,
but that proved to be a mis-
take. He might even have
been the victim of a hoax,
since he could not possibly
have attained the tempera-
tures and pressures re-
quired.

Bridgman’s work on
high pressure (see 1905)
made the conversion possi-
ble at last, however, and in
1955 scientists managed to
attain pressures of 100,000
atmospheres and tempera-
tures of 2,500° C. In addi-
tion, they used chromium
as a catalyst. As a result,
they formed synthetic dia-
monds (indistinguishable
from the “real thing”) out
of graphite. Eventually,
with still higher tempera-
tures and pressures, graph-
ite was turned into
diamond without the need
for a catalyst.

Field lon
Microscopes

The art of magnifying the
small reached a new pla-
teau in 1955 when the
German-born American
physicist Erwin Wilhelm
Mueller, who had devel-
oped the field-emission mi-
croscope (see 1937), devised
the field ion microscope,
which emitted beams of
ions rather than electrons.

This device strips positively
charged helium ions off

an extremely fine, curved
needle tip, kept at liquid-
hydrogen temperatures,
and shoots them, in diver-
gent paths, at a fluorescent
screen. What appears on
the screen then is a vastly
magnified image (a million
times or more) of the nee-
dle tip.

With such magnifica-
tions, individual atoms
could be seen as dots
and their arrangement
studied.

Nucleic Acid
Formation

Watson and Crick had
worked out the structure of
DNA and shown how the
two strands of the double
helix, when separated,
could each form a second
strand (see 1953).

The formation of the
second strand, however,
must surely require the ca-
talytic services of an en-
zyme. In 1955 the Spanish-
born American biochemist
Severo Ochoa (b. 1905) iso-
lated such an enzyme from
the bacterium Aztobacter
vinelandii. 1t was capable
of catalyzing the formation
of RNA-like substances
from individual nucleo-
tides.

Soon afterward the
