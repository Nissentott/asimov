Literature

Telling stories is probably
as old as speech, and gifted
storytellers were probably
as much in demand fifty
thousand years ago as they
are today. Eventually, quite
elaborate stories were
memorized and told, or
chanted, to audiences
Homer’s [liad and Odyssey
were probably recited
many times before being re-
duced to permanent form.

Once writing was in-
vented, it could only be a
matter of time before it was
used to record the more fa-
mous oral tales and sagas.
As long as a tale is avail-
able only in oral form, a
person can only hear it
when a bard is available
and is willing to recite it. It
represents a rare theatrical
performance. Once the
same tale is in written
form, it can be read at will
and at any time. A written
story is a permanently
available bard.

The Sumerians, who in-
vented writing, were very

  

likely the first to put tales
into writing. One of thesc
tales was discovered in the
remains of the library of
Ashurbanipal, an Assyrian
king who ruled from 668 to
626 B.C

 

nearly two thou

sand years after the Sumeri-

ans had established written
literature

The discovery was
made in 1872 by an Ex
archaeologist, George
Smith (1840-1876). He

lish

 

found twelve clay tablets in-

scribed with cuneiform
writing, telling the tale of a
Sumerian king named Gil-
gamesh and his search for
immortality.

The story may have
first appeared in writlen
form as early as 2500 B.c. It
contains, as a subplot, the
tale of a great flood that
had ravaged the Tigris
phrates valley some centu-
ries earlier. This story was
borrowed by the biblical
writers, who described it as
Noah's Flood and imagined
it to have been worldwide

The story of Gilgamesh

is the oldest written tale

that has survived to

day almost intact and may

be considered to represent
the founding of written lit
erature.

Glass

Glass is made out of sand
rather than out of clay as
pottery is. Glass is not
really a solid at all but a
liquid that is so stiff it does

not flow perceptibly and

 

seems to be solid. It is much

   

more fragile and easily bro
ken than pottery is, and it
would not be considered a
reasonable competitor for a
moment except for its
beauty. Glass has a certain

transparency, and the pres

  

ence of impurities (some-

 

times deliberately added)
can give it deep and lovely
