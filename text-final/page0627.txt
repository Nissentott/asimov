Nuclear Fission
Bomb

For a nuclear chain reac-
tion to take place (see
1939), it is necessary to ac-
cumulate enough fissile ma-
terial (uranium-235 or an
appropriate plutonium iso-
tope manufactured from
uranium-238) to bring
about an explosion. The
amount of fissile material
has to be large enough (the
critical mass) for enough of
the neutrons produced to
strike other nuclei before
wandering out into open
air.

If two pieces of fissile

 

material, each below the
critical mass and therefore
nonexploding, are fired into
each other to form a single
piece above the critical
mass, any stray neutron
(and there are always some
around) will start the chain
reaction and the material
will explode in a fraction of
a second.

By mid-1945 enough
fissile material had been
collected to carry through a
test. On July 16, 1945, at a
site 60 miles northwest of
the town of Alamogordo,
New Mexico, a nuclear fis-
sion bomb (popularly
called an atomic bomb, or

1 A-bomb) made of pluto-

nium was detonated before
dawn. The
charge had expected an ex-

cientists in

 

plosive force equivalent to
5,000 tons of TNT. W}
they got was the equivalent
of 20,000 tons of TNT

At a stroke, the face of
war had changed totally, It
was even possible that the
fate of humanity had been

  

sealed.
