tronomy, and though it was
fifty years before astrono-
mers generally could bear
to turn their backs on Ptol-
emy and accept the fact
that the vast Earth flew
through space on an annual
journey about the Sun, the
book marked the birth of
what came to be called the
Scientific Revolution. With
it came final proof that the
ancients did not know it all
and that moderns might
strike out on their own in
new directions and reach
new heights—and they cer-
tainly did.

It could be argued that
just as printing made the
Protestant Reformation
possible, it also made the
Scientific Revolution possi-
ble.

New Anatomy

Just as Copernicus was
overturning Greek notions
of astronomy, a Flemish
anatomist, Andreas Vesa-
lius (1514-1564), was upset-
ting Greek notions of
anatomy. Unlike other anat-
omists of the period, Vesa-
lius was willing to trust his
own eyes when they dis-
agreed with the statements
of the Greeks.

He put together the re-
sults of his researches in a
book entitled De Corporis
Humani Fabrica (Concern-
ing the Structure of the
Human Body) in which he
corrected over two hundred
errors of Galen (see 180).
What's more, the book took
advantage of the technique

of printing to reproduce
careful illustrations of ana-
tomical facts, drawn by the
Flemish artist Jan Stephan
van Calcar (ca. 1499-after
1545), who had been a stu-
dent of Titian.

Vesalius's book was
published in 1543, the same
year in which Copernicus’s
book appeared, and this
double appearance
strengthens the feeling that
the year marks the begin-
ning of the Scientific Revo-
lution.

Negative
Numbers

Until this time, mathemati-
cians had assumed that all
numbers, whether integers,
fractions, or irrationals,
had to be greater than zero.
It might seem, after all,

that one could not possibly
have less than nothing.

On the other hand,
mathematicians knew there
were such things as debts.
To have no money and to
owe a sum to someone else
means having less than no
money. This might seem
merely like practical busi-

ness, nothing to do with
ethereal numbers, but Car-
dano (see 1535) showed, in
1545, that debts and simi-
lar phenomena could be
treated as negative num-
bers, which would follow
rules of mathematics very
similar to those that ordi-
nary numbers did. You
