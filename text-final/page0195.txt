 

spite the fact that forces
other than gravitation are
known today, and that
Newton’s description of
gravitation has been re-
fined since, it still remains
true that gravitation is the
overriding force that con-
trols the great sweeps of
the Universe, and that New-
ton’s formulation is an ex-
cellent one if distances and
velocities are not too great.

Shape of the
Earth

In the Principia, Newton re-
ferred to Richer’s expedi-
tion to Cayenne, in French
Guiana, which helped de-
termine the parallax of
Mars (see 1672). While
there, Richer had found
that a pendulum beat more
slowly than it did in Paris,
so that a clock that would

1688

have been correct in Paris
lost two and a half minutes
a day in Cayenne.

Newton pointed out
that this could be so if the
force of gravity were
slightly weaker in Cayenne
than in Paris or if Cayenne
were farther from the
Earth’s center than Paris
was. Since Cayenne, like
Paris, was at sea level, the
conclusion was that sea
level must itself be higher
at Cayenne than at Paris.

Newton showed that if
a body rotated, a centrifu-
gal effect would act to
counter gravitation to a cer-
tain extent and that this
countering force would be
zero at the poles and grow
stronger and stronger as
one moved away from the
poles until it reached a
maximum at the Equator.
The centrifugal effect
would, in other words, give

rise to an equatorial bulge,
which would make the di-
ameter across the Equator
somewhat longer than the
diameter from pole to pole

Jupiter and Saturn,
which are much larger than
Earth, spin much faster
and are, in addition, made
of lighter material. In their
cases, the equatorial bulges
are so great that their orbs
look clearly elliptical
rather than circular.
Earth’s outline drawn from
pole to pole and back
would also be slightly ellip-
tical (though not noticeably
so to the unaided eye). In-
stead of being almost per-
fectly spherical as the Sun
and Moon are, Earth would
be an oblate spheroid ac-
cording to Newton's reason-
ing. (Of course, the matter
would have to be checked
by actual measurement
eventually.)

 

 

Plate Glass

For centuries clear glass
had been a luxury item. Lit-

tle by little, though, the art
of pressing or casting glass
(that is, the making of
sheets by some means other

than blowing) was devel-
oped. At first the sheets
were quite small, but by
1688 in France, large sheets
