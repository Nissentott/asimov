Human Beings
in Space

The Soviet Union had put a
dog into orbit four years be-
fore, where it was eventu-
ally put to death painlessly.
A year before, the Soviet
Union had put two dogs in
space and brought them
back alive. What followed
was inevitable.

On April 21, 1961, Yury
Alekseyevich Gagarin
(1934â€”1968) was put into
orbit by the Soviet Union
in the spaceship Vostok I.
He circled the Earth once
in 89 minutes and was
brought back alive. On Au-
gust 6, 1961, a second So-
viet cosmonaut, Gherman
Stepanovich Titov (b.

1935), was put into orbit
and circled the Earth seven-
teen times, remaining in
space for a full day.

Microwave
Reflections
from Venus

Fifteen years before, micro-
waves had been reflected
from the Moon. That had
been comparatively easy.
By 1961 the technique had

 

advanced to the point
where microwaves could be
sent out to Venus, a hun-
dred times as far away as
the Moon. This was done,
and reflections were re-
ceived by five different
groups, one Soviet, one
British, and three Ameri-
can.

The microwaves trav-
eled through space at the
speed of light, and from the
time measured between the
emission of the original
beam and the detection of
the veflection, the distance
of Venus and therefore the
general scale of the Solar
System could be deter-
mined much more accu-
rately than had been
possible from observations
of the asteroid Eros (see
1941).

Heliosphere

The previous year, the
United States had put up
Echo I, which expanded
into a large sphere of alumi-
num foil from which micro-
wave reflections could be
obtained. By 1961 its orbit
had been followed so care-
fully that the Belgian physi-
cist Marcel Nicolet could
calculate the drag of the

thin wisps of atmosphere
present at the heights
through which the satellite
was moving. The large vol-
ume of the satellite and its
comparative lightness mag-
nified that drag so that it
was possible to deduce the
density of the air ata
height of from 200 to 600
miles above Earth's surface
and to show that it con-
sisted largely of helium.
This region was known as
the heliosphere.

Above it was a still
more rarefied region con-
sisting chiefly of hydrogen
(the protonosphere). This
was thought to continue
thinning out for 40,000
miles before dwindling into
the general density of the
gases in interplanetary
space.

Quarks

In 1961 Gell-Mann, who
had advanced an explana-
tion of strange particles
(see 1953), worked out a
method for bringing order
to the numerous hadrons
that were being discovered.
He grouped them into
families in which certain
particle properties in-
creased in value in a regu-
