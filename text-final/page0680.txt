not as great as the tempera-

Magnetosphere

In 1958 the United States
entered the Space Age. The
Soviet Union had placed
two satellites in orbit in
1957, Sputnik I on October
4 and Sputnik II on Novem-
ber 3. The latter carried a
dog, the first living animal
to be placed into orbit.

The first successful
American satellite was Ex-
plorer I, which was
launched on January 31,
1958. It carried counters de-
signed to estimate the num-
ber of charged particles in
the upper atmosphere, and
detected about the ex-
pected concentrations of
particles at heights of up to
several hundred miles, but
at higher altitudes the num-
ber fell to zero. Two other
satellites launched soon af-
terward, one by the United
States and one by the So-
viet Union, recorded the
same phenomenon.

The American physicist
James Alfred Van Allen (b.
1914) did not believe the
count could really fall to
zero. He felt that what
happened was that the
count went so high it
put the counter out of
action.

When Explorer IV was

launched by the United
States on July 26, 1958, it
carried special counters
that were shielded with a
thin layer of lead to keep
out most of the radiation
(rather like wearing sun-
glasses to protect the eyes).
The radiation that pene-
trated the lead was not
enough to overwhelm the
counters, and now the
count went up and up and
up with increasing altitude
—far higher than scientists
had expected.

It appeared that sur-
rounding the Earth, outside
the atmosphere, there were
belts containing high con-
centrations of charged par-
ticles that moved along the
lines of force of Earth’s
magnetic field. These parti-
cles approached the Earth's
surface in the neighbor-
hood of the Earth's mag-
netic field. There they were
responsible for the aurorae
and, at times of unusually
high concentration, for
magnetic storms that af-
fected the compass and
electronic equipment.
These belts were at first
called the Van Allen belts
but were eventually re-
ferred to as the magneto-
sphere.

This was the first im-
portant discovery—an en-
tirely unexpected one—to
be made as a result of the
launching of artificial satel-
lites.

Nobelium

The effort to form elements
with higher and higher
atomic numbers set a new
record in 1958 with the for-
mation of a few atoms with
the atomic number of 102.
There was some delay
while the identity of the
new atoms was confirmed,
and when they were, the el-
ement was given the name
of nobelium after Nobel (see
1866).

Photocopying

An important aspect of of-
fice procedures is the copy-
ing of documents. Copying
by hand is slow and cum-
bersome, and errors inevita-
bly arise. Carbon paper and
mimeograph machines
were great improvements
but usually messy.

An American physicist,
Chester F. Carlson (1906—
1968), strove to find a
method of copying that
would use dry powder, elec-
tric charge, and light. Be-
cause nothing moist is
used, the procedure he
found is called xerography
(Greek for “dry writing"),
and because light is used, it
is called photocapying. It
works by giving paper a
positive electric charge and
the powder a negative elec-
tric charge, so that the pow-
der clings to those places
where light does not pene-
