In the case of biology it was

particularly important, for
it led eventually to
thoughts of biological evo-

Star Maps

The Greek mathematician
Eudoxus (ca. 400â€”ca. 350
B.C.), perhaps about 350

B.C., drew a better map of
the Earth than Hecataeus

had managed (see 510 B.c.),

were physical landmarks:
coastlines, rivers, mountain
ranges, and so on. In the
sky there were only stars.

The reasonable thing to
