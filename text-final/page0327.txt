circuit, and a second flash,
in the opposite direction,
when he opened the circuit.

Faraday explained this
by means of the lines of
force that he had visual-
ized. When a circuit was
closed and electricity was
set to flowing, magnetic
lines of force sprang out-
ward and crossed the sec-
ond coil, inducing an
electric current. When the
circuit was opened again,
the magnetic lines of force
collapsed inward and
crossed the second coil
again, inducing an electric
current in the opposite di-
rection. When the magnetic
lines remained in place be-
cause the current in the
first coil was flowing stead-
ily, no lines crossed the sec-
ond coil in either direction
and no current was induced
in it.

Faraday went on to de-
vise a way of having metal
cut across the lines of force
continually. He turned a
copper wheel so that its
rim passed between the
poles of a permanent horse-
shoe magnet. As long as the
copper wheel turned, its
rim continually cut
through magnetic lines of
force and an electric cur-
rent flowed continually in
the wheel. That current
could be led off and made
to do work. Faraday had
thus devised the first elec-
tric generator.

Until then, electric cur-
rent had been produced
only by batteries, which
meant that the electricity
was obtained by burning
metals such as zinc. This
meant that electricity was
expensive and limited in
quantity.

The turning of the cop-
per wheel to cut across the
magnetic lines of force took
considerable effort, and it
was this energy that was
turned into electricity. If
one had to turn the wheel
by muscle power, little elec-
tricity could be obtained.
However, the wheel could
be and eventually was
driven by steam power,
which meant that the elec-
tricity was formed from
burning fuel or from some
other copious source of en-
ergy such as falling water
or blowing wind.

Eventually, when the
electric generator was suf-
ficiently improved, electric-
ity could be generated
cheaply and in any quan-
tity desired.

Electric Motors

Henry (see 1823) discovered
electrical induction inde-
pendently of Faraday, but
the latter published first by
a few months and gets the
credit. Henry went on to
study the reverse process. If
the rotary motion of a cop-
per wheel cutting across

magnetic lines of force can
induce an electric current,
then an electric current
ought to be able to produce
a rotary motion.

In essence, Faraday
had already shown this in a
simple way (see 1821), but
in 1831 Henry devised a
much more practical ver-
sion of such a machine, one
in which a wheel would
turn if electric current was
supplied. This was the first
practical electric motor
(from a Latin word mean-
ing “to move'").

The importance of the
motor cannot be overem-
phasized. A motor can be
made as large or as small
as desired. It can be run by
electricity brought to it
over a distance of many
miles. Most important of
all, it can (unlike a steam
engine) be started in a mo-
ment and stopped in a mo-
ment.

The supply of cheap,
abundant electricity made
possible by Faraday'’s dis-
covery of the generator
(once it was sufficiently im-
proved) would have been
useless without some
means of putting it conve-
niently to work. Henry’s
motor (once it was suffi-
ciently improved) did that,
so that between them, Fara-
day and Henry ushered in
the age of electricity.
