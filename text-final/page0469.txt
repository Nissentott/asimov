over gases. The new group
of inert gases remained.
Those with the higher
atomic weights were easily
liquefied, to be sure. Even
neon, with the next-to-low-
est atomic weight, could be
liquefied at 27° K.

Helium, however, with
the lowest atomic weight of
the inert gases, remained a
gas even at liquid-hydrogen
temperatures.

Phoebe

In 1898 the American as-
tronomer William Henry
Pickering (1858—1938) dis-
covered a ninth satellite of
Saturn, which he named
Phoebe, after still another
of the siblings of Saturn
(Cronos) in the Greek
myths. It was far more dis-
tant from Saturn than the
satellites discovered ear-
lier, and it revolved around
the planet in a retrograde
direction (clockwise rather
than counterclockwise, if
viewed from high above Sa-
turn’s north pole), so that it
is considered to be a cap-
tured asteroid.

Eros

Since the time of Kepler, it
had been thought that, ex-
cept for the Moon, no siz-
able object approached
Earth more closely than the
planet Venus, which at its
closest can be only
25,000,000 miles away from

us. As for the swarming as-
teroids, they seemed all to
be circling between the or-
bits of Mars and Jupiter,
and none were expected to
approach more closely than
35,000,000 miles.

But then, on August 13,
1898, the German astrono-
mer Gustav Witt discov-
ered asteroid number 433.
When its orbit was plotted,
it proved to be a real stun-
ner. At aphelion (when it is
most distant from the Sun),
it is well within the aster-
oid belt. At perihelion, how-
ever, it is only 105,000,000
miles from the Sun—well
within the orbit of Mars. At
its closest to the Earth, the
two could be only a little
over 14,000,000 miles
apart.

Since it approached
Earth more closely than
Mars or Venus did, Witt
gave it the name of the
child of Mars and Venus in
the Greek myths—Eros.
That began the habit of giv-
ing masculine names to as-
teroids whose orbits extend
outside the asteroid belt.

Since then, other aster-
oids have been discovered
with orbits that intersect
that of Mars. All those that
can approach Earth more
closely than Venus does are
called Earth-grazers. Eros
was the first of these to be
discovered and is the
largest, being at least 15
miles in its longest diame-
ter.

Filtrable Virus

Pasteur had not been able
to find a microorganism
that caused rabies (see
1885). Rather than suppose
there was something wrong
with the germ theory of dis-
ease, however, he suggested
that the causative agent ex-
isted but was too small to
see even by microscope.

Another disease with
no known causative agent
was tobacco mosaic dis-
ease, so called because a
mosaic pattern forms on
the leaves of the tobacco
plant. It was easier to work
with a plant disease than
with something as virulent
as rabies, and in 1892, a
Russian botanist, Dmitri lo-
sifovich Ivanovsky (1864—
1920), mashed up infected
leaves and passed the fluid
through a fine filter that
would keep back all bacte-
ria.

The fluid that passed
through the filter could still
infect healthy tobacco
plants with the disease, but
Ivanovsky could not bring
himself to believe there
were causative agents
smaller than bacteria and
supposed simply that the
filters were defective.

In 1898 the Dutch bota-
nist Martinus Willem Beij-
erinck (1851-1931) did a
similar experiment, but he
had no hesitation in main-
taining that there was a
causative agent smaller
