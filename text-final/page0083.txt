Iceland

Between 500 and 800, Ire-
land had experienced a

kind of Golden Age of learn-

ing, which was ended by
the coming of the Vikings.
An Irishman, Brendan
(ca. 484-578), is supposed
to have sailed northward
about 550 and explored the
islands off the Scottish
coast, the Hebrides to the
west and the Shetlands to

900

the north, and he may have
probed further. There are
stories that the Irish
reached Iceland and settled
there, but if so, they did not
stay for long or they died
out

 

In 874 a Viking chief-
tain named Ingolfur Arnar-
son sailed westward and
landed in Iceland, which is
650 miles west of Norway
By that time the frish set-
tlers if any were gone, or if

any remained, they were
killed by the Vikings. In
either case, it was the

Horse Collars

With moldboard plow (see
600) and horseshoes (see
770), all that was needed to
convert the horse into a
farm animal was some
good way of harnessing it.
In 900, or even some

time before, the horse col-
lar came into use. This al
lowed the horse 1o pull
with the shoulder instead
of the windpipe and in-
creased the horse’s avail-
able force fivefold.

Now, finally, the food
