 

virtually all the modern
world.

The seven planets had
paths around the sky, paths
that passed through certain
conglomerations of stars
that were termed, in total,
the zodiac by the later
Greeks. This was divided
into twelve constellations,
so that the Sun remained in
each constellation for about
a month. Eventually the
Sumerians and Babylo-
nians worked out the path-
ways in some detail and
could predict, in at least a
rough manner, where the
planets would be at future
times. That represented the
beginning of mathematical
astronomy.

Since the Sun affected
the Earth profoundly, mak-
ing the difference between
the day and night, and the
Moon's phases marked the
length of the month, it
seemed natural to suppose
that the other planets also
had significance to human
beings. Imaginative sugges-
tions were made about the
influence of each, as it var-
ied in position with respect
to the stars and other plan-
ets, and an intricate system
of foretelling the future
from planetary positions

was evolved. This is astrol-
ogy.

Astrology is utter non-
sense, but people strongly
want the security of know-
ing the future, so that even
today astrology is accepted
by many people who are un-
educated, unsophisticated,
or simply silly.

Fermentation

Fruit juices that are left
standing will sometimes
ferment; that is, undergo
changes that alter the taste.
The same is true of moist-
ened grain. Human beings,
driven by thirst or hunger,
might consume such fer-
mented materials and then
find that they liked the
taste and the aftereffects.
They were, of course, con-
suming alcohol, formed
from sugars and starches
by yeast, and they would
grow elated as a result, be-
cause somewhat intoxi-
cated. (This is not an
exclusively human trait.
Birds and animals will
sometimes greedily feed on
fermented fruits and be-
come obviously intoxicated
too.)

This may have hap-
pened in prehistoric times,

B

but by 1800 B.c. the use of
fermented materials was so
common that laws had to
be passed directing what
was to be done in the case
of misdeeds committed
under the influence of too
much beer.

From the¢ beginning of
agriculture, grain was con-
verted into lour, which
was moistencd and made
into flat, hard, but nourish-
ing bread. Every once ina
while, though, the moist-
ened dough fermented and
released gases (carbon diox-
ide) that caused the bread
to rise and grow spongy.
The result was leavened
bread (from a Latin word
meaning “to rise’), which
was just as nutritious as
flat bread but softer and
much more pleasant to eat.

The Egyptians discov-
ered this not long after
1800 B.c. and eventually
learned that the process
could be controlled. If some
of the fermenting bread
was saved before it was
baked and added to dough
that had not yet begun to
ferment, the fresh dough
would ferment in its turn.
One would not have to de-
pend on chance.
