An Austrian physicist,
Victor Franz Hess (1883—
1964), felt that the source
must be somewhere in the
ground, so in 1911 he took
electroscopes up on balloon
flights to get them out of
range of the ground radia-
tion.

He made ten flights
and observed quite to his
astonishment that the gold
leaves came together up to
eight times as rapidly at
considerable heights as
they did at ground level.
The radiation seemed to be
coming from above, after
all—to be coming from
outer space, from the cos-
mos generally. Millikan
(see above) suggested,
therefore, that the radia-
tion be called cosmic rays, a
name that stuck.

For his discovery, Hess
was awarded a share of the
Nobel Prize in physics in
1936.

Super-
conductivity

Kamerlingh Onnes, having
liquefied helium and ob-
tained temperatures of 4 de-
grees above absolute zero
(4° K) and even lower (see
1908), was eager to study
the properties of matter at
such exceedingly low tem-
peratures.

For instance, it was
known that metals tended
to lessen their resistance to

an electric current as the
temperature went down. It
seemed to Kamerlingh
Onnes that this lessening
must continue all the way
down to absolute zero,
where it must disappear al-
together.

He tested the matter on
mercury, and resistance
dropped more or less as ex-
pected till he reached a tem-
perature of 4.2° K. There, to
his surprise, the resistance
dropped suddenly to zero.

This phenomenon—the
perfect conductivity of an
electric current at tempera-
tures close to absolute zero
—was called superconduc-
tivity. It was soon found
that other metals (though
not all) also showed the
phenomenon, the resistance
dropping to zero at some
very low temperature that
was characteristic for each
metal.

Chromosome
Maps

Morgan had shown that
chromosomes could cross
over from one gene to an-
other, which allowed them
to be inherited separately
where previously they had
been linked, or inherited to-
gether. Obviously, the far-
ther two genes were from
each other on a particular
chromosome, the greater
the chance that a crossover
somewhere along the chro-

mosome would separate
them.

Morgan and his as-
sistant, the American
geneticist Alfred Henry
Sturtevant (1891-1970), in-
vestigated the frequency of
separation by crossover in
an attempt to locate the
genes governing particular
characteristics on a chro-
mosome. The first such
chromosome map was pre-
sented in 1911.

Tumor Virus

Cancer, one of the most
dreaded diseases, is not
obviously contagious. On
the other hand, it is not a
single disease but a whole
family of diseases involv-
ing unrestrained growth,
with characteristics that
may differ from one to
another.

An American physi-
cian, Francis Peyton Rous
(1879-1970), had occasion
to examine a chicken with
a tumor. When it died,
Rous decided to test among
other things whether it
might contain a virus, He
was sure it didn’t but felt it
wise to make sure by experi-
ment.

He mashed up the
tumor and passed it
through a filter fine enough
to keep out anything larger
than a virus. To his sur-
prise, he found that this fil-
trate was infectious and
would produce tumors in
