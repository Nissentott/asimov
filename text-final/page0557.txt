radioactively to another
atom, comparative packing
fractions reduced the total
mass somewhat, and this
made a certain amount of
kinetic energy available for
the emerging alpha parti-
cles. The alpha particles in-
variably came out with the
energy to be expected of the
mass loss.

Beta particles re-
mained puzzling. The maxi-
mum energies they
possessed were always
those to be expected of the
mass loss, but there were
beta particles that invari-
ably emerged at lesser ener-
gies—all the way to zero—
and the explanation for
that still eluded physicists.

Exclusion
°

Principle
Bohr and Sommerfeld had
worked out the energy lev-
els of the electrons in an
atom (see 1913). These
could be expressed as quan-
tum numbers, which fol-
lowed certain simple rules.
Three quantum numbers
were known at this time.

The Austrian-born
American physicist Wolf-
gang Pauli (1900-1958) con-
sidered the matter and felt
that there was need for a
fourth quantum number, If
that were allowed ac-
cording to certain rules,

 

then it would be possible to
show that no two electrons
in a particular system of
electrons could have all
four quantum numbers
alike. In other words, if a
particular electron in an
atom had one of the four
quantum numbers, all the
other electrons would be ex-
cluded from having that
number. This was called
the exclusion principle, and
it allowed the arrangement
of electrons in any atom to
be worked out. It also ex-
plained why Mendeleyev's
periodic table (see 1869)
took the form it did.

For the exclusion prin-
ciple, Pauli was awarded
the Nobel Prize for physics
in 1945.

Particle Spin

Once Pauli had enunciated
the exclusion principle (see
above), two Dutch physi-
cists, George Eugene Uhlen-
beck (1900-1988) and
Samuel Abraham Gouds-
mit (1902—1978), at once
pointed out that the fourth
quantum number that
Pauli had decided was re-
quired could be interpreted
neatly as particle spin. Each
particle, such as an elec-
tron, could spin either
clockwise or counterclock-
wise at a rate that could be
expressed as +'2 or — ',
Eventually, similar

spins (equal to 2 or some
multiple thereof) were
found to exist for almost all
other particles.

Matrix
Mechanics

Beginning with Bohr (see
1913), physicists had tried
to interpret spectral lines
(which represented energy
given off or taken up as elec-
trons passed from one state
to another) using images
similar to those used for
planets circling a star. They
spoke of circular orbits, el-
liptical orbits, tilted orbits,
rotation about an axis (par-
ticle spin), and so on.

The German physicist
Werner Karl Heisenberg
(1901-1976) considered all
this useless and misleading.
He preferred to take the
numbers representing the
energy level and manipu-
late them without regard to
their pictured significance.
In 1925 he developed a
form of manipulation
called matrix mechanics for
the purpose.

Magnetism and
Absolute Zero
The Dutch physicist Willem
Hendrik Keesom (1876~

1956) had managed to
reach a temperature of 0.5
