 

This meant that the
age of old samples of wood,
parchment, textiles, and so
on could be determined,
even if they were as old as
45,000 years or so.

This opened the door to
judging the age of Egyptian
mummies, of wood from
structures built in prehis-
toric times, and of such his-
toric and possibly ancient
objects as the Dead Sea
scrolls and the Shroud of
Turin.

For this, Libby re-
ceived the Nobel Prize for
chemistry in 1960.

Crab Nebula as
Radio Source

It had been sixteen years
since Jansky first detected
radio waves from outer
space (see 1932), but only
since World War II had
techniques been developed
that permitted handling of
the microwave radiation
used in radar. These tech-
niques could now be ap-
plied to astronomy.

In 1947 the Australian
astronomer John C. Bolton
had a radio telescope that
was capable of locating a
radio source with sufficient
precision to associate it
with an object that could
be identified optically.
Thus he found that the
third strongest radio source

in the sky was clearly the
Crab Nebula, which was
the remains of a great su-
pernova explosion (see
1054).

The Crab Nebula was
the first optical object dis-
covered to be a radio
source, and this was the
first indication that radio
astronomy might offer a
technique for making dis-
coveries that were not ap-
parent from the simple
study of visible light itself.

Martian
Atmosphere

Since Schiaparelli had first
detected the “canals” of
Mars (see 1877), a feeling
had persisted among nonas-
tronomers, and even among
some astronomers, that
there might be life on
Mars.

In 1947, however, the
Dutch-born American as-
tronomer Gerard Peter
Kuiper (1905-1973) ana-
lyzed the reflected infrared
light of Mars and reported
that the Martian atmo-
sphere seemed to be almost
entirely carbon dioxide.
There was no sign of nitro-
gen, oxygen, or water
vapor. With that, the no-
tion of an advanced civiliza-
tion on Mars, or of any but
possibly the simplest forms
of life, went glimmering.

Coenzyme A

The carbohydrates, fats,
and proteins of food, in the
course of their metabolism,
all break down to an acetyl
group, also called a nvo-car-
bon fragment. This is then
built up again to form the
substances characteristic of
an organism’s own tissues.
In 1947 Lipmann (see
1941) was able to isolate a
substance that was essen-
tial to the transfer of the
acetyl group from one com-
pound to another. He called
it coenzyme A, where the A
stood for acetyl group. The
structure of coenzyme A
was found to include that
of pantothenic acid, one of
the B vitamins. Pantothenic
acid is essential to life and
must be present in our
food, because the human
body cannot form it within
its own tissues, cannot
form coenzyme A without
it, and cannot run meta-
bolic changes without coen-
zyme A.

Chloramphenicol

During World War II, peni-
cillin (see 1939) and strepto-
mycin (see 1940) had been
isolated and the age of anti-
biotics had begun. In 1947
chloramphenicol was iso-
lated from the same group
of molds that had yielded
streptomycin.
