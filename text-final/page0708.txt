riods of rotation (and there-
fore the frequency of their
pulsations) should slowly
be lengthening. Close obser-
vation showed that this
was indeed the case, and
the identification of pulsars
as rotating neutron stars

  

was accepted.

1969

Circumnavigation

of the Moon

On September 17, 1968, the
Soviet probe Zond 5, with
no crew aboard, circumnav-
igated the Moon. On De-
cember 24, 1968, the

American probe Apollo 8,
with three astronauts
aboard—Frank Borman (b.
1928), James A. Lovell, Jr.
(b. 1928), and William A.
Anders (b, 1933)—circum-
navigated the Moon ten
times. The stage was finally
set for a lunar landing.

 

 

Human Beings
on the Moon

At 4:18 p.m. eastern day-
light savings time on July
20, 1969, Neil Alden Arm-
strong (b. 1930) and Edwin
Eugene Aldrin, Jr. (b. 1930)
brought the lunar module
of Apollo 11 to the surface
of the Moon, while Michael

 

Collins (b. 1930) remained
in orbit about the Moon.
Neil Armstrong stepped
out, the first human being
to set foot on any world
other than the Earth, say-
ing "That's one small step
for a man, one giant leap
for mankind."” John Ken-
nedy’s goal of reaching the
Moon by the end of the de-
cade had been reached.

 

The two men remained
on the Moon for 21 hours 37
minutes and returned to
Earth safely at 12:51 p.m.
eastern daylight savings
time on July 24, eight days
alter takeoff. A second
American ship landed on
the Moon in November
1969, and astronauts re-
mained on the Moon's sur-
face for 15 hours.
