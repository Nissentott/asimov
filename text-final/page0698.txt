Background
Microwave
Radiation

The German-born Ameri-
can physicist Arno Allan
Penzias (b. 1933) and the
American radio astronomer
Robert Woodrow Wilson (b.
1936) were attempting to
determine the char:
tics of any radio-wave emis-
sion that might come from
the outer regions of the Gal-
axy. They made use of a big
horn-shaped antenna origi-
nally built to detect radio
reflections from the Echo
satellite (see 1961).

In May 1964 they found
an excess of radio-wave
emission that they could
not explain. When they had
accounted for all possible
sources of error (including

 

teris-

 

pigeon droppings inside the
antenna), they found that
there was a distinct back-
ground microwave radia-
tion, coming from all
directions with equal inten-
sity.

They turned to the
American physicist Robert
Henry Dicke (b. 1916), who
remembered that Gamow
had predicted such back-
ground radiation would
occur as a consequence of
the bang (see 1948)

The background radia-
tion was characteristic of a
universe with an average
temperature of 3 degrees
above absolute zero, and it
could be assumed that the
Universe had cooled to that
average temperature from
that prevailing at the mo-
ment of the big bang. The
background radiation, as a

 

 

fossil remnant (so to speak)
of the big bang, finally es-
tablished that event as the
very likely mechanism
whereby the Universe came
into being.

For this discovery, Pen-
zias and Wilson received a
share of the Nobel Prize for
physics in 1978.

Omega-Minus
Particle

Gell-Mann had suggested
the Eightfold Way as a
means of ordering hadrons
into groups (see 1961). In
one of the groups he had set
up was an empty spot that
ought to hold a particle
with a particular set of
properties if his method of
arrangement was valid. In-
cluded in those properties
