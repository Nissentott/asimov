of the experiments of Priest-
ley and of Rutherford (see
1772), he realized in the
light of his own experi-
ments that air must consist
of a mixture of two gases:
one-fifth was Priestley’s
gas, which Lavoisier named
oxygen (from Greek words
meaning “acid producer,”
because it was mistakenly
felt at the time that all
acids contained oxygen),
and four-fifths were Ruther-
ford’s gas, which Lavoisier
named azote (from Greek
words meaning ‘‘no life”),
but which later came to be
known as nitrogen.

Clearly, it was oxygen
that supported combustion
and animal life and oxygen
that was involved in rust-
ing. Animals must consume
oxygen and produce carbon
dioxide, and from Priest-
ley’s earlier experiment
(see 1771), plants must con-
sume carbon dioxide and
produce oxygen. Between
these two forms of life, the
atmosphere’s makeup re-
mained stable.

Chlorine

In a classic case of scientific
misfortune, the Swedish
chemist Carl Wilhelm
Scheele (1742-1786) had
discovered oxygen at least
two years before Priestley
did, and by the same
method. However,
Scheele’s discovery was not

published (through the neg-
ligence of a publisher) until
after Priestley’s discovery
had been reported, so
Priestley gets the credit.

Scheele, however, dis-
covered many simple com-
pounds from plants and
animals, to say nothing of
such poisonous gases as hy-
drogen fluoride, hydrogen
sulfide, and hydrogen cya-
nide. He was also involved
in the discovery of a num-
ber of elements, though he
never managed to get undis-
puted credit for a single
one of them.

Thus, by 1774 he had
done most of the spade-
work that led to the discov-
ery of the element
manganese. His friend, the
Swedish mineralogist
Johan Gottlieb Gahn
(1745-1818), however, took
the final step and gets
credit for the discovery.

Also in 1774, Scheele
isolated the gas chlorine,
which was unusual in not
being colorless. Chlorine is
greenish-yellow in color,
and its name, in fact, is de-
rived from the Greek word
for “green.” The trouble
was that Scheele did not
recognize chlorine to be an
element but thought it was
a combination of some sub-
stance with oxygen. Chlo-
rine was found to be an
element about thirty years
later, and it was to that
finder that credit for the dis-
covery was awarded.

Mind and
Disease

Throughout history, dis-
eases had been cured (so it
was said) by various mystic
rites, by the laying on of
hands, the saying of pray-
ers, and so on.

In 1774 the German
physician and mystic Franz
Anton Mesmer (1734-1815)
began to apply science to
this by waving magnets
over his patients, and ef-
fecting cures in some cases.
Later, he discovered that
magnets were unnecessary
and that the same happy re-
sults could be achieved by
simply passing hands over
the patient. He claimed to
be making use of animal
magnetism.

Naturally, in some
cases he did not effect a
cure, and he was driven out
of Vienna, where he first
practiced, as a quack. He
went to Paris, where again
he was first popular and
then forced to leave. His
methods were examined by
such men as Franklin and
Lavoisier.

Franklin, for one, al-
though he condemned Mes-
mer’s mysticism,
recognized that the mind
influenced the body: that it
could cause disorders and
that it could be used to cor-
rect them.

What Mesmer was deal-
