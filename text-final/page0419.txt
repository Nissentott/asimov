Electric Light

With a source of energy like
electricity, there seemed a
chance of having light with-
out flame. A current forced
across an air gap can pro-
duce a bright spark, and
arc lights had been intro-
duced by Davy (see 1800)
nearly three-quarters of a
century before, but the
light was harsh and the
danger of fire was great. Ed-
ison now tackled the prob-
lem of an alternate form of
electric lighting.

Electricity passing
through a wire warmed it
because of the wire's resis-
tance. If the resistance was
made great enough by mak-

ing the wire thin enough,
the wire would heat to in-
candescence. If it did so,
however, it would either
melt or burn.

To prevent burning,
the wire filament would
have to be in an evacuated
glass bulb. That would also
soften the light and lessen
the danger of fire to nearly
nothing.

That still left the prob-
lem of finding a conductor
that would not melt. Edi-
son spent a considerable
time experimenting with
platinum wire, but plati-
num was too expensive—
and wouldn’t work

Finally, after thou-
sands of experiments, Edi-

son found what he wanted,
and it wasn't a metal at all.
He used a scorched cotton
thread, which proved to be
equivalent of a carbon
wire. On October 21, 1879,
Edison sent a current
through such a filament in
an evacuated glass bulb. It
burned for 40 continuous
hours. Edison promptly ob-
tained a patent, and on the
following New Year's Eve,
he illuminated the in
street of Menlo Park using
his electric light bulbs be-

 

 

 

fore a crowd of three thou-
sand.

To make the light bulb
useful, Edison had to de-
velop a generating
that would supply electric-
