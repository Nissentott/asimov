oresce.

He placed certain
chemicals, known to fluo-
resce easily, inside a cath-
ode ray tube, surrounded it
by dark paper, and dark-
ened the room to observe
the pale fluorescence that
would result.

On November 5, 1895,
he set his cathode-ray tube
to working, and in the dim-
ness, a flash of light that
did not come from the tube
caught his eye. A sheet of
paper coated with barium
platinocyanide (one of the
chemicals he was planning
to use) was glowing. The
glow ceased when the cath-
ode-ray tube was turned
off. The coated paper
glowed even in the next
room once the cathode-ray
tube was turned on.

Radiation was clearly
emerging from the tube
when the cathode rays were
streaming, and was pene-
trating matter to some ex-
tent. Rontgen didn't know
what the radiation might
be, so he referred to it as X
rays, x being the usual sym-
bol for an unknown quan-
tity in mathematics. He
published his findings on
December 18, 1895.

The news of these X
rays roused the world of
physics to a furor not seen
since @rsted had discov-
ered electromagnetism (see
1820). So much work was

 

done, and so many revolu-
tionary findings were made
(most of them as a direct re-
sult of Réntgen's finding)
that Rontgen is often
viewed as having set off a
second Scientific Revolu-
tion, as Copernicus had set
off the first (see 1543).

For this work, Réntgen
received the Nobel Prize in
physics (the first one) in
1901.

Cathode Ray
Particles

There were still some who
thought that cathode rays
were a wave form and
doubted Crooke's observa-
tion that they carried elec-
tric charges.

Hertz, the discoverer of
radio waves (see 1888), had
found that cathode rays
could pass through thin
sheets of metal, and this
seemed to favor their being
a wave form. In 1892 one of
Hertz's assistants, the Ger-
man physicist Philipp Edu-
ard Anton Lenard (1862—
1947), devised a cathode
ray tube with a thin alumi-
num “window” through
which cathode rays could
emerge into open air. Len-
ard studied these open-air
cathode rays and received a
Nobel Prize in physics in
1905 as a result. He, too,
thought cathode rays to be
waves.

In 1895, however, a
French physicist, Jean-Bap-
tiste Perrin (1870-1942),
showed that when cathode
rays were made to impinge
upon a cylinder, the cylin-
der gradually gained a
large negative charge. That
finally settled the matter.
Cathode rays were streams
of negatively charged parti-
cles, and no one has
doubted it since.

Velocity and
Mass

The negative results of the
Michelson-Morley experi-
ment (see 1887) still at-
tracted the attention of
physicists. The Dutch physi-
cist Hendrik Antoon Lo-
rentz (1853—1928) came to
the same conclusions that
FitzGerald had come to con-
cerning the shortening of
distance with speed (see
1892) but went farther. It
seemed to Lorentz that
mass would have to in-
crease with velocity and do
so at a steadily increasing
rate. At a speed of 160,000
miles per second, the mass
of any object should have
doubled, and at the speed
of light (a little over
186,000 miles per second),
it should become infinite.
This idea made the
speed of light appear to be
an absolute maximum. As a
result of Lorentz's work,
