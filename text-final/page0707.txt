produced, some of which
reach the Earth and a few
of which would interact,
under appropriate condi-
tions, with detecting de-
vices. This would prove
their existence.

Frederick Reines, who
with Cowan had first de-
tected the antineutrino,
now tried to detect neutri-
nos from the Sun. For the
purpose, he set up a huge
tank containing 100,000
gallons of tetrachlorethy-
lene in a deep mine in
South Dakota. There was
enough rock and earth
above the tank to absorb all
radiation from the sky
other than neutrinos. The
tank was then exposed to
neutrinos from the Sun for
several months. Each neu-
trino that was absorbed by
achlorine atom in the tetra-
cholorethylene would be
converted to an argon atom,
which could eventually be
flushed out with helium.

By 1968 evidence of the
existence of solar neutrinos
was definitely obtained, but
there were not enough of
them. Calculations seemed
to show that the Sun was
actually producing, at
most, only one-third of the
neutrinos that it ought to
be producing if current the-
ories of nuclear activity at
the Sun’s core were correct.
This mystery of the missing
neutrinos has concerned as-

tronomers ever since.

 

Astrochemistry

When the hydroxyl group
had been detected in inter-
stellar gas clouds (see
1963), astronomers had
been surprised. It seemed
odd that enough individual
atoms would strike each
other and cling, forming
two-atom combinations
like the hydroxyl group, to
be detectable at astronomic
distances. It was thought
there would be virtually no
chance for combinations of
three or more atoms.

The increasing ability
to detect microwave radia-
tion with great precision,
however, led to further sur-
prises. In 1968 microwave
frequencies characteristic
of water molecules (with
three atoms each) and am-
monia molecules (with four
atoms each) were detected
in interstellar gas clouds.
This was the beginning of
what came to be called as-
trochemistry. Since then,
more and more compli-
cated atom groupings have
been detected, some involv-
ing as many as thirteen
atoms.

All but the very sim-
plest are composed of
chains of carbon atoms,
which once again points up
the uniqueness of the car-
bon atom as a component
of complex groupings, and
therefore of life as we
know it.

Rotating
Neutron Stars

Pulsars had been discov-
ered (see 1967), and now
the problem was to explain
what produced pulsations
in the range of seconds.
Something had to be revolv-
ing, rotating, or pulsating
at that rate, and nothing
could be doing so that
quickly on a cosmic scale
unless it was simultane-
ously very small and very
massive.

In 1968 Thomas Gold
(b. 1920) suggested that pul-
sars were neutron stars
(whose existence had been
suggested by Zwicky—see
1934) and that they were ro-
tating. Neutron stars,
which could be as massive
as ordinary stars but would
be only some 14 kilometers
or so across, wotuld be com-
posed of packed neutrons,
They would have enor-
mously intense magnetic
fields, so that charged parti-
cles would be emitted only
at the magnetic poles, and
they would give off radia-
tion as they followed
curved paths. The beam of
radiation would sweep past
us once each revolution,
and the revolution would
take place in seconds.

If this were so, the pul-
sars wotld be losing sub-
stantial amounts of energy
as they turned, and their pe-
