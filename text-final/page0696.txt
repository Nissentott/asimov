tronomer Allan Rex San-
dage (b. 1926) and the Aus-
tralian astronomer Cyril
Hazard, and found to origi-
nate in certain objects that
looked like dim stars, It
seemed strange that dim
stars would be such strong
radio sources, and the feel-
ing arose that they might
be something other than
stars. They were referred to
eventually as quasistellar
radio sources, where quasi-
stellar means “'starlike,”
and this was eventually
shortened to quasars.

The spectra of quasars
proved puzzling; the lines
could not be identified. In
1963, however, the Dutch-
born American astronomer
Maarten Schmidt (b. 1929)
realized that the lines could
be identified if they were
viewed as lines that would
ordinarily be in the ultravi-
olet but had been displaced
by means of an enormous
red-shift.

Such a red-shift would
mean that the quasars were
enormously distant, over a
billion light-years away,
and the fact that they could
be seen at all at such a dis-
tance meant they were un-
usual indeed. It was finally
decided that they were gal-
axies with extremely active
centers (like particularly
large Seyfert galaxies—see
1943). At their distances,
only the centers could be

seen, so that they had a star-
like appearance. Some qua-
sars have been detected
that appear to be over 12
billion light-years away.

Arecibo Radio
Telescope

In 1963 the largest single
radio telescope ever built
was put into use. It was lo-
cated about 8 miles south
of Arecibo, Puerto Rico,
and is about 1,000 feet
across. It is not steerable,
however, but is fixed in
place.

X-Ray Sources

Through most of history,
the only information reach-
ing us from the stars had
consisted of visible light
waves. For the past thirty
years, microwaves from as-
tronomical objects had also
been studied. Both light
and microwaves can pene-
trate Earth's atmosphere,
but there are other forms
of radiation that cannot.
They can only be studied
by rockets, carrying appro-
priate instruments, that
are sent up beyond the
atmosphere.

Thus, X rays from as-
tronomical objects are com-
pletely absorbed by the
atmosphere and cannot be
observed from Earth’s sur-

face. Rocketry, however,
had made it possible to de-
tect X rays in the solar radi-
ation.

Still more interesting
news came in 1963, when
Bruno Rossi, who had done
important work on cosmic
rays, began to use rockets
to observe whether solar X
rays were reflected from
the Moon. He did not suc-
ceed in detecting such radi-
ation. However, he did
detect it emerging from the
Crab nebula and also from
another supernova remnant
in the constellation of Scor-
pio.

As rocket observation
became more common and
more sophisticated, many
other X-ray sources beyond
the Solar System were lo-
cated.

Hydroxyls in
Space

Trumpler had shown that
there were thin wisps of
matter in interstellar space
(see 1930), and van de
Hulst and Purcell had
shown that hydrogen atoms
were strewn across space
(see 1944 and 1951).

It was reasonable to
suppose that all this inter-
stellar gas consisted of sin-
gle atoms, since they would
be spread out so thinly that
the chances of collision
