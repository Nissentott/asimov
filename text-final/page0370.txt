Lines of Force

Faraday had introduced the
concept of lines of force (see
1821), but since he knew no
mathematics, he could only
describe them pictorially.

The British mathemati-
cian James Clerk Maxwell
(1831-1879) was able to
translate Faraday's concept
into mathematical form in
1855 and show that the for-
mer’s intuitive grasp of the
subject was completely cor-
rect.

Geissler Tubes

Air pumps such as those de-
vised by Guericke and
Hooke (see 1645 and 1657)
did not produce very good
vacuums. A much better
vacuum had earlier been
produced by Torricelli
when he allowed a mercury
column to drop downward
out of its closed end (see
1643).

In 1855 the German in-
ventor Johann Heinrich
Wilhelm Geissler (1815—
1879) took advantage of
Torricelli’s discovery to de-
vise an air pump without
moving mechanical parts.
By moving a column of mer-
cury up and down, he could
make the vacuum above
the column suck air out of a
container. In this way, Geis-
sler produced tubes that
were more thoroughly evac-
uated than anything seen
previously. Tubes so evacu-
ated were called Geissler
tubes, and their use was to
lead in the decades that fol-
lowed to remarkable ad-
vances in the study of
atomic structure.

Seismograph

An earthquake of consider-
able magnitude cannot be

mistaken for anything else.
However, there are numer-
ous small earthquakes that,

in our busy, rumbling life,
may go unnoticed.

In 1855 an Italian phys-
icist, Luigi Palmieri (1807—
1896), invented a device for
the detection of such small
tremors. This consisted of
horizontal tubes, turned up
at the ends and partly filled
with mercury. Even slight
quakes would cause the
mercury to bob from side
to side. Small iron floats
were so attached that their
movements could be read
off on a scale and the inten-
sity of the quake estimated.

This was the first crude
seistmograph. It was not
very useful; traffic vibra-
tions, for instance, were dif-
ficult to distinguish from
minor earthquakes; but it
was a beginning.

Pyroxylin
In 1855 a British chemist,

Alexander Parkes (1813—
1890), found that pyroxylin
