Law of Definite
Proportions

The French chemist Joseph-
Louis Proust (1754—1826)
was working in Spain at
this time in order to escape
the turmoil of the French
Revolution and took part in
a heated controversy over
whether the composition of
substances varied with the
manner of manufacture.

Using painstakingly
careful analysis, Proust
showed in 1799 that copper
carbonate contained defi-
nite proportions, by weight,
of copper, carbon, and oxy-
gen, no matter how it was
prepared in the laboratory
or how it was isolated from
nature. The preparation
was always five parts of
copper to four of oxygen to
one of carbon.

He went on to make a
similar case for a number
of other compounds and
maintained that there was
a general law of definite pro-
portions, often called
Proust’s law.

In this way, Proust
could distinguish between
mixtures (in which differ-
ent elements could exist in
any proportions, as in air)
and compounds (in which

different elements mixed in
definite proportions and no
other).

Strata

Many observers had noted
that rocks existed in layers,
or strata (the Latin word for
“layers”). An English geolo-
gist, William Smith (1769—
1839), who was engaged in
working on canals, had fre-
quent opportunities to see
the strata at excavation
sites.

He became interested
in strata to the exclusion of
all else and, in 1799, began
writing on the subject.
Smith made a new point.
Each stratum had its own
characteristic forms of fos-
sils, not found in other
strata. No matter how the
strata were bent and crum-
pled—even when one sank
out of view and cropped up
again miles away—its fos-
sils went with it. In fact, it
seemed to Smith, one could
identify a stratum from its
fossil content.

Since it could be rea-
sonably supposed that a
stratum nearer the surface
was younger than one
deeper down, the strata of-
fered a method for working
out an orderly history of

life from the fossils and
even coming to some rough
conclusions as to how long
ago different fossils had ex-
isted as living forms.

Perturbations

In 1799 Laplace (see 1783)
published the first volume
of a monumental five-vol-
ume work called Celestial
Mechanics, in which the
gravitational influences on
the various bodies of the
Solar System were taken
up in detail. Although the
Sun dominates the system,
and the planets move about
the Sun in stately ellipses,
each planet pulls at the oth-
ers, and so do the satellites.

These small additional
pulls introduce minor vari-
ations in the movement of
the planetary bodies, called
perturbations, and it was
considered that they might
gradually increase in size
over time so that the Solar
System would prove unsta-
ble in the long run.

Laplace showed that
this was not the case. The
perturbations are periodic
and vary on either side of
what would exist if the Sun
alone had a gravitational
pull. The Solar System,
then, is stable.
