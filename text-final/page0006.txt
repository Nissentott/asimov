they could stab animals at
a distance. If the spears
were thrown, the distance
could be made long enough

to obviate immediate retali-
ation.

Hominids became
hunters and killed off the
competing australopithe-

cines, no doubt, so that for
the last million years, all
hominids, without excep-
tion, have been part of
genus Homo.

By 1,600,000 B.c., Homo ha-
bilis was gone. For one
thing, it had evolved into a
new species, Homo erectus,
with members about as
large and as heavy as mod-
ern human beings. If any ex-
amples of Homo habilis
existed after the new spe-
cies had established itself,
they didn'’t last long.

Between 1,000,000 B.c.
and 300,000 B.c., Homo
erectus was the only homi-
nid in existence. It was the
first hominid that could, in
some cases, attain a height
of as much as 6 feet and
weigh over 150 pounds. The
brain was larger, too, some-
times three-fourths as
heavy as that of modern
human beings.

Homo erectus made
much better stone tools
than had been made before.
As hunters, its members
were capable of taking on
the biggest animals they
could find. They were the
first hominids who could
hunt mammoths success-
fully.

Homo erectus made

two particularly enormous
advances.

All the hominids, for as
much as three and a half
million years, had been con-
fined to the southeastern
half of Africa. Homo erectus
was the first hominid to ex-
pand that range signifi-
cantly. By 500,000 B.c.
Homo erectus had moved
into the rest of Africa, into
Europe and Asia, and even
into the Indonesian islands.

In fact, the first discov-
eries of the remains of
Homo erectus were made on
the Indonesian island of
Java, where the Dutch an-
thropologist Marie Eugene
Dubois (1858—-1940) discov-
ered a skullcap, a femur,
and two teeth in 1894. No
hominid with so small a
brain had yet been discov-
ered, and Dubois named it
Pithecanthropus erectus
(from Greek words mean-
ing “‘erect ape-man’’).

Similar finds were
made near Peking, begin-
ning in 1927, by a Canadian
anthropologist, Davidson
Black (1884-1934). He
named his hominid
Sinanthropus pekinensis

(Greek for ““Chinaman from
Peking”’).

Eventually it was rec-
ognized that both sets of re-
mains, along with others,
were of the same species
and deserved to belong to
genus Homo. Dubois’s term
erectus was kept, even
though hominids had been
walking erect for at least
two and a half million
years before Homo erectus
had evolved. This was not
known in Dubois’s time,
however.

By the time Homo
erectus had evolved, the
Earth was in a glacial pe-
riod. When the glaciers
were at their peak, they
withdrew so much water
from the sea that the sea
level dropped as much as
300 feet, exposing the conti-
nental shelves under the
shallow sections. It was
this that made it possible
for Homo erectus to wander
from the Asian continent to
the Indonesian islands.

The cold weather en-
forced new habits. Homo
erectus traveled in bands,
as earlier hominids must
have, but made shelters by
