Embryology

It was customary at this
time to think that seeds
and eggs (or pollen and
sperm) had miniature or-
ganisms in them that sim-
ply grew. Some even
thought that an organism
within an egg might have
eggs of its own with ultra-
miniature organisms
within and still smaller
eggs—and so on.

In 1759, however, the
German physiologist
Kaspar Friedrich Wolff
(1734—-1794) showed that
specialized organs devel-
oped out of unspecialized
tissue. Thus the tip of a
growing shoot consists of
undifferentiated and gener-
alized tissue. As it grows,
however, specialization de-
velops, and some bits of tis-
sue develop into flowers,
while other bits, originally

undistinguishable, develop
into leaves.

The same principle
could, and did, apply to ani-
mals, so that the idea of
miniature organisms in
eggs disappeared. Wolff is
considered another of the
founders of modern embry-
ology, in consequence.

Earthquakes

Human beings have always
known about earthquakes
from sad and frightening
experience. What they
didn’t know was the cause.

Early theories attributed
them to the restlessness of
gods or demons imprisoned
underground. The ancient
Greek philosophers, in
search of a more rational
cause, supposed that there

might be pent-up air under-
ground, which occasion-
ally, in its attempt to
escape, shook the earth.
The Lisbon earthquake
of 1755 forced serious think-
ing on the matter. In 1760,
