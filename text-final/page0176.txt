Cell

The use of the microscope
was now spreading rapidly
and one of the best of the
early microscopists was
Hooke (see 1657). In 1665
he published Micrographia,
which outlined his work in
this field. It had some of the
most beautiful drawings of
microscopic observations
ever made.

His most important dis-
covery (though it did not
seem so at the time, no
doubt) involved the struc-
ture of cork. Under the mi-
croscope, he found a thin
sliver of cork to be com-
posed of a finely serried pat-
tern of tiny rectangular
holes. These he called cells,
from a Latin word for
“small chamber” —espe-
cially one of the type that
exists in rows, as monas-
tery cells or prison cells do.

The cells that Hooke
observed were empty only
because they were found in
dead tissue. In living tissue
they are filled with fluid,
and that disqualifies them
from being called cells,
strictly speaking. The
name, however, clung,

Light Diffraction

It was about this time that
the question of waves ver-
sus particles began to

be raised, one that was

to be argued for a long
time.

Water waves could be
seen, and the fact that they
tended to curve around ob-
stacles could be considered
a characteristic of all
waves. Particles, on the
other hand, if moving in a
straight line, did not curve
around obstacles but either
struck and bounced back
(being reflected) or missed
and continued moving in a
straight line.

Since sound curved
around obstacles, it was
taken to be a wave phenom-
enon. Since light cast sharp
shadows, it was natural to
think of it as composed of
tiny particles.

An Italian physicist,
Francesco Maria Grimaldi
(1618-1663), made an ob-
servation that was pub-
lished posthumously in
1665. He had let a beam of
light pass through two nar-
row apertures, one behind
the other, and then fall on a
blank surface. He found
that the band of light on
that surface was a trifle
wider than the apertures.

He believed, therefore, that
the beam had been bent
slightly outward at the
edges of the aperture, a phe-
nomenon he called diffrac-
tion.

This would make it
seem that light was a wave
phenomenon.

But a wave's bending
about an obstacle depends
on the relative size of the
wave and the obstacle. Any
wave will be reflected by a
barrier considerably larger
than itself: water waves
will be reflected by a break-
water and sound waves will
be reflected by a cliff wall.
Since light waves were re-
flected from small objects,
and diffraction was only
very slight, it must follow
that if light were composed
of waves, they were very
small waves indeed.

However, Grimaldi's
work was largely neglected
and the controversy went
on for a century and a half
without reference to him.

Planetary
Rotations

The fact that features could
be made out on the surface
of some of the planets
meant that those features
could be observed from
