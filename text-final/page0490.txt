or “absolute time,” since
both depend on velocity
and therefore have mean-
ing only relative to the
viewer. Nevertheless, de-
spite this absence of abso-
lutes, the laws of physics
still held for all “frames of
reference.” In particular,
Maxwell's equations (see
1865) still held, though the
much older and more re-
vered laws of motion as
worked out by Newton had
to be modified.

The theory is special,
because it confines itself to
the special case of objects
that are moving at constant
velocity. Under those condi-
tions, the theory does not
take into account the effect
of gravitational interac-
tions, which are every-
where present and which
force accelerations on mo-
tion.

Einstein's view of the
Universe seemed to go
against common sense, but
that was only because the
average person deals with a
Universe of small distances
and small velocities. Under
those conditions, Newton's
theories hold almost per-
fectly. In fact, Einstein’s
equations reduce to New-
ton’s under such condi-
tions. However, where
large distances and large
velocities are involved, Ein-
stein’s equations hold and
Newton’s do not.

In the eight decades

since special relativity was
advanced, endless tests and
observations have upheld it
completely. No divergences
between reality and the
Einsteinian view have been
found.

Mass-Energy

Another consequence of
Einstein's theory of special
relativity (see above) is that
mass must be viewed as a
highly concentrated form of
energy. Einstein’s equation
representing this is the fa-
mous e = mc?, where e is
energy, m is mass, and ¢ is
the speed of light. The
speed of light is so huge
that to square it and multi-
ply it by even a small
amount of mass is to repre-
sent a large amount of en-
ergy (1 gram of mass equals
900 billion billion ergs of
energy),

Whenever any process
gives off energy, it loses a
little mass; when it absorbs
energy, it gains a little
mass. The amount of mass
lost or gained under ordi-
nary conditions is so min-
ute it had never been
detected. That is why Lavoi-
sier could consider mass
conserved independently of
energy (see 1769) and Helm-
holtz could consider energy
conserved independently of
mass (see 1847).

With the study of radio-
activity, much larger en-
ergy changes per unit mass

were involved, as Pierre
Curie had found (see 1901).
Mass-energy equivalence
could then be measured
and was found to be pre-
cisely as Einstein's theory
required it to be. The law of
conservation of energy was
thus extended and made
more precise by the inclu-
sion of mass as one more
form of energy. The law of
conservation of mass be-
came obsolete, or rather,
was included in what is
sometimes known as the
law of conservation of mass-
energy.

Photoelectric
Effect and
Quanta

In 1905 the photoelectric ef-
fect, as observed by Lenard
(see 1902), was combined
with quantum theory (see
1900) by Einstein.

He showed that if light
consisted of quanta, with
energies proportional to fre-
quency (inversely propor-
tional to wavelength), then
the atoms in a metal sur-
face could only absorb in-
tact quanta. Furthermore,
long-wavelength quanta
would not supply enough
energy to eject an electron
from the metal, no matter
how intense the light might
be. But as wavelength grew
shorter, energy quanta
grew larger, and a point
would be reached where
