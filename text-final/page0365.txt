George Phillips Bond
(1825-1865).

Then, in 1851, Lassell
discovered a third and
fourth satellite of Uranus.

He followed Herschel's
precedent (see 1789) by
naming them after spirits
in English literature. One
he named Ariel after a spirit

in Shakespeare’s The Teni-
pest and the other Unibriel
after a spirit in Pope's The
Rape of the Lock.

Joule-Thomson
Effect

In 1852 Joule (see 1843)
and Thomson (see 1848)
were able to show that if a
gas was allowed to expand,
it consumed energy, be-
cause the molecules had to
separate against a certain
tendency to cling together.
If energy were kept from en-
tering the gas, the energy
for expansion would have
to come from the gas itself,
and the temperature would
drop.

This came to be called
the Joule-Thomson effect
and would later be used to
liquefy some of the perma-
nent gases (see 1845).

Valence

Chemists knew that ele-
ments had different capacit-
ies for combining with
other elements. For in-
stance, an oxygen atom
would combine with two
hydrogen atoms to form
water, a nitrogen atom
would combine with three
hydrogen atoms to form
ammonia, and a carbon
atom would combine with
four hydrogen atoms to
form methane.

This was not studied
closely and systematically,
however, until an English
chemist, Edward
Frankland (1825-1899),
studied organometallic
compounds.

He could not help notic-
ing the manner in which
metallic atoms combined
with organic compounds,
and how each different
kind of atom would almost
invariably hook onto a
fixed number of other atom
groupings. In 1852 he pub-
lished his theory of what
came to be called valerce
(from a Latin word for
“power”’), pointing out that
a particular atom had the
power to combine with
fixed numbers of other
kinds of atoms according to
simple rules.

The notion of v
imposed a new kind of
order on the elements, be-
