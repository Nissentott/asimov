tal consisted of layers of
atoms that were spaced
just as regularly as, but far
more closely than, the

ruled scratches of any grat-
ing. A beam of X rays
aimed at a crystal ought
then to be diffracted as ordi-
nary light would be by an
ordinary grating. The re-
sults would be compli-
cated, because ordinary
gratings consist simply of
parallel lines, while crys-
tals contain layers of atoms
extending in various direc-
tions. Still, it could be
done.

In 1912 Laue tried the
experiment of passing X
rays through a crystal of
zine sulfide and recording
the diffraction pattern on a
photographic plate. It
worked perfectly. It was
clear that such a diffraction
pattern could be used to cal-
culate X-ray wavelengths,
and that once the wave-
lengths were known, the
technique could be used to
study the fine structure of
crystals.

For his work on X-ray
diffraction, Laue was
awarded the Nobel Prize
for physics in 1914.

Neon Varieties

Thomson (see 1897) found
himself interested in the
canal rays that Goldberg

 

had discovered a quarter-
century earlier (see 1886).
By 1912 it was clear that
they were composed of posi-
tively charged subatomic
particles, so Thomson
called them positive rays. In
the light of Rutherfordâ€™s nu-
clear atom (see 1911), the
positive rays appeared to
be streams of atomic nu-
clei.

In 1912 Thomson stud-
ied the manner in which
positive rays were deflected
by magnetic and electric
fields. He balanced those
helds in such a way that
particles of different
charge-to-mass ratio
curved differently and fell
in different spots on a pho-
tographic plate.

When he deflected
streams of neon nuclei, he
found to his surprise that
they landed on two differ-
ent spots, as though there
were two varieties of neon
atom that differed in
charge, mass, or both. Ob-
servations such as this were
soon to introduce new con-
cepts of atomic structure
that proved to be of the
greatest importance.

Dipole
Moments

Now that it was understood
that electrons formed part
of atoms, it followed that

when atoms joined to form
molecules, electrons ought
to be distributed over the
various atoms of the mole-
cules.

Such distribution
might be symmetrical, so
that the molecule was elec-
trically uncharged, or un-
symmetrical, so that one
part of the molecule might
have a surplus of electrons
and thus a slight negative
charge while another part
might have a deficit of elec-
trons and a slight positive
charge. These would repre-
sent positive and negative
poles of the molecules,
which would thus be polar
molecules, or molecular di-
poles.

Naturally, polar mole-
cules and nonpolar mole-
cules would act differently
with respect to electric
fields. In addition, polar
molecules would attract
each other, positive toward
negative, and therefore
have higher melting and
boiling points than nonpo-
lar molecules of similar
size.

In 1912 a Dutch physi-
cal chemist, Peter Joseph
William Debye (1884~
1966), worked out a set of
equations that would repre-
sent the behavior of such
polar molecules. This gave
rise to the concept of dipole
moments and greatly
helped chemists under-
