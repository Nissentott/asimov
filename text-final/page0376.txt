of his studies of diseased tis-
sues in a book called Cellu-
lar Pathology in 1858. There
he showed that abnormal
cells that marked one dis-
ease or another arose from
normal cells. There was no
sudden change, but a
smooth development of ab-
normality. This served to
found the science of cellular
pathology.

Virchow went on to op-
pose the idea of spontane-
ous generation. He pointed
out that “all cells come
from cells,” and since the
cell is already a complex or-
ganization of simpler parts,
it is unlikely that it can
originate easily from dead
matter.

Refrigerators

Reducing food to a low tem-
perature kept it from spoil-
ing, and in early times,
natural ice was used for the
purpose. Even in summer,
snow or ice could be
brought from nearby moun-
tainous areas. And ice gath-
ered from ponds in the
winter could be insulated
with straw and kept in un-
derground icehouses
through the summer,

In the early nineteenth
century, a number of peo-
ple tried to design mechani-
cal refrigerators. The
efforts of scientists to lig-
uefy gases had made it

clear that, if a gas were lig-
uefied and then allowed to
evaporate, it would lower
its own temperature and
therefore its surroundings.
If the vapor were then con-
densed by pressure and al-
lowed to evaporate again,
over and over, heat would,
in effect, be pumped out of
the refrigerator into the sur-
rounding air.

The first such device
that we would recognize as
similar in essence to those
we have today, and that
was a reasonable commer-
cial success, was designed
by a French inventor, Ferdi-
nand Carré (1824-1900).
His first device, built in
1858, used water, but in
1859 he switched to ammo-
nia, which was much more
efficient.

Of course, the early re-
frigerators were bulky and
inconvenient, and ammo-
nia was a corrosive and poi-
sonous substance. They
were used only industrially,
for ice-making or in meat-
packing plants, for in-
stance, to preserve the
meat. It took some three-
quarters of a century of
improvement before refrig-
erators became convenient
and almost universal house-
hold appliances.

Electricity in a
Vacuum

Occasionally, scientists
would try to force an elec-
tric current through a vac-
uum, hoping, perhaps, that
they would be able to study
the electric fluid itself,
which would be forced out
into the open if there were
no matter obscuring it. Far-
aday (see 1821) had tried it,
for instance, and noticed
that the glass vessel enclos-
ing the vacuum showed a
greenish glow. This glow
was given the name of fluo-
rescence in 1852 by the
British physicist George
Gabriel Stokes (1819-1903)
(a term now applied to any
visible light that arises
from the energetic collision
of radiation with

matter).

However, the vessels
were never sufficiently
evacuated to make possible
the study of the electric
fluid itself, at least not until
the Geissler tube (see 1855)
was devised.

In 1858 the German
physicist Julius Pliicker
(1801-1868) forced an elec-
tric current through a Geis-
sler tube. He detected the
fluorescence, described it,
and noted that the pesition
of the fluorescence shifted
in response to an electro-
magnetic field. Whatever
was happening in the tube,
