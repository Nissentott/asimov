Planetary Tables

Nothing better than Ptol-
emy's tables of planetary
motion (see 140) had been
prepared in eleven centu-
ries. Now a new set was
prepared under the
sponsorship of Alfonso X of
Castile, who reigned from
1252 to 1284. He was very
interested in astronomy

and was no fool at it and
was called Alfonso the Wise
in consequence. He is fa-
mous for a remark he made
in reference to the calcula-
tions necessary to the prep-
aration of the tables: “If
God had asked my advice, I
would have suggested a
simpler design for the Uni-
verse.”

He was right. The

Universe is certainly enor-
mously more complex than
Ptolemy thought it was, but
with respect to the informa-
tion necessary for prepar-
ing planetary tables, it was
simpler in design than Ptol-
emy had thought. Neverthe-
less, the Alfonsine tables
were an improvement on
what had gone before.

 

1269

 

Magnetic Poles

In 1269 a French scholar,
Pelerin de Maricourt (13th
century), also known by his
Latin name of Petrus Pere-
grinus de Maricourt, was
taking part in the slow and
dull siege of an Italian city.
To pass the time, he wrote
a letter to a friend describ-
ing his researches on mag-

nets. He described the
existence of magnetic poles,
regions on a magnet where
the magnetic force was
most intense, and showed
how to determine the north
and south poles of a mag-
net, since like poles re-
pelled each other and
unlike poles attracted each
other. He also explained
that one could not isolate a

pole, for if a magnet were
broken into smaller pieces,
each piece would have both
a north and south pole.
This is about the first
piece of good scientific ex-
perimentation in the mod-
ern sense, although it
would be more than three
centuries before experimen-
tal science was well estab-

lished.
