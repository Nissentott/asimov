Electronic
Rectifier

A British electrical engi-
neer, John Ambrose Flem-
ing (1849-1945), studied
the Edison effect on a hot
filament and a cold plate
enclosed in an evacuated
glass vessel and separated
by a gap. He noted that the
electric current only flowed
across the gap if the hot fil-
ament was the negative
electrode (the cathode) and
the cold plate was the posi-
tive electrode (the anode).
In that case, electrons
poured into the hot fila-
ment and were driven off
by the heat. If the current
was reversed and electrons
poured into the cold plate,

there was insufficient en-
ergy to send them flying
outward.

If an alternating cur-
rent was sent through the
vessel, the anode and cath-
ode changed place many
times a second, and there
was a spurt of electrons
each time the filament was
a cathode but nothing
when it was an anode. The
current went in as an alter-
nating current but came
flowing out in only one di-
rection, as a direct current,
even if the flow was in little
gushes.

In this way, the vessel
containing the filament and
plate acted as an electronic
rectifier, because it let elec-
tricity through in only one
direction. Fleming called it

 

a valve, which is descrip-
tive. In the United States,
however, it was for some
reason called a tube, which
is not descriptive. Because
it contains two electrodes,
it can also be called a diode.

Fleming's rectifier was
the first of a long line of
radio tubes (so called be-
cause they became most fa-
miliar to the general public
in radios) that made elec-
tronic devices work.
