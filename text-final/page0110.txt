better known by his self-
chosen name of Regiomon-

In this way, for the first
time, the exact path of a
comet across the sky was
plotted. It marked the be-
ginning of rationalism with
respect to those bodies.

By that time, his rebellious
crew forced him to turn

located the southernmost
point of the continent, and
reported it to King John II
of Portugal (1455-1495) as
the Cape of Storms, for obvi-
