Woodward (see 1944), who

molecules, finally spent ten
years attempting the syn-
thesis of perhaps the most
complicated nenpolymeric
molecule of them all—vita-
min B-12. In 1972, he suc-
ceeded.

Punctuated
Evolution

Since the development of
Darwin’s notion of evolu-
tion by natural selection
(see 1858), the general feel-
ing had been that evolution
was a slow process but a
steady one.

In 1972 this view was
challenged by the American
paleontologists Stephen
Jay Gould and Niles El-
dredge, who suggested
what they called puncru-
ated evolution. In this view,
species are stable and per-
sist virtually unchanged for
a long time. Then, certain

torized circuits, it weighed
only 2'2 pounds and cost
merely $150. In subsequent
years, both the weight and
the cost decreased dramati-
cally.

  

 

small groups of a particular
species, subjected for some
reason to a special environ-
mental pressure, change
comparatively rapidly and
develop into a new species.
Evolution, then, is a matter
of stable situations punctu-
ated by occasional periods
of rapid change

This view has not yet
been generally accepted,
but it is characteristic of
the present-day turmoil in
the matter of biological evo-
lution. No biologist of any
standing doubts that evolu-
tion has taken place, but
some facets of the exact
mechanism of evolution re-
main under dispute.
