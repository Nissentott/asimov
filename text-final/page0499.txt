was always present in ura-
nium and thorium ores. In
1907 he pointed out that
from the quantity of lead in
uranium ores and from the
known rate of uranium dis-
integration, it might be pos-
sible to determine with
reasonable accuracy how
long a portion of the
Earth’s crust had been
solid and had existed essen-
tially undisturbed.

It had been about a cen-
tury and a quarter since
Hutton had said that he
saw no sign of a beginning
to Earth’s history (see
1785), but now at last radio-
active dating looked like a
technique that might yield
such a sign. Boltwood's sug-
gestion has born fruit ever
since.

Lutetium

The rate of discovery of ele-
ments had been falling off
—at least of elements that
were not involved in radio-
active series. Up to this
point, thirteen elements had
been isolated from the rare
earth minerals, which might
have exhausted the supply,
but there turned out to be
room for another. In 1907
the French chemist Georges
Urbain (1872-1938) discov-
ered a fourteenth and
named it lutetium, from an
old name for the Roman
town that had stood on the
site of what is now Paris.

Synthetic
Peptides

It was well known that pro-
tein molecules were built
up out of amino acids, but
it was not known in just
what manner those amino
acids connected with each
other. It seemed most likely
that the amino group of one
amino acid combined with
the acid group of another,
but that was not certain.

In 1907, however, Fi-
scher, who had determined
the structure of sugar mole-
cules (see 1884), combined
amino acids by chemical
techniques that insured a
combination between the
amino group of one amino
acid and the acid group of
the next. He continued this
until he had built up a
chain consisting of eighteen
amino acids.

He compared such a
chain with those resulting
from the breakdown of pro-
tein molecules by digestive
enzymes. The fragments of
a protein molecule so ob-
tained are called peptides,
from the Greek word for
“to digest.” Fischer found
that his synthetic peptides
matched the properties of
the natural peptides ob-
tained from protein in all
important ways. Indeed,
the synthetic peptides
could also be broken down
by digestive enzymes.

The basic structure of
the protein molecule was
thus known. What re-
mained was to determine
the precise order of amino
acids in given protein mole-
cules, but that was not to
happen for another half-
century.

Chemotherapy

The medieval alchemists
had attempted to cure dis-
ease by the use of various
chemicals. They were not
truly successhul (except oc-
casionally by accident), be-
cause they did not know the

. cause of disease and had no

way of testing particular
chemicals in a rational
manner before using them.
Their techniques were
largely abandoned, there-
fore.

The German bacteriolo-
gist Paul Ehrlich (1854—
1915) returned to the no-
tion of chemical cures (he
coined the word chemother-
apy in this connection) on a
much more knowledgeable
basis. It was understood,
thanks to the work of Flem-
ming (see 1882), that syn-
thetic dyes could combine
with some parts of cells
and not others and could
more markedly affect some
cells than ethers. It oc-
curred to Ehrlich that if a
dye could be found that
combined with some patho-
genic organism but not
