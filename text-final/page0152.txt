Baffin Bay

The search for the North-
west Passage continued.
The English explorer Wil-
liam Baffin (ca. 1584-1622)
in 1615 sailed his ship up
the western coast of Green-
land into a stretch of water
now known as Baffin Bay.
By 1616 he had made his
way northward to nearly 78
degrees North Latitude.
That placed him within 800
miles of the North Pole, and

no one would get closer to
that for two and a half cen-
turies. Baffin concluded,
correctly, that there was no
practical Northwest Pas-
sage.

Tierra del Fuego

Drake had seen open water
south of Tierra del Fuego
(see 1578). In January 1616
the Dutch navigator Jakob
Le Maire (1585—1616)
sailed around the southern

end of Tierra del Fuego,
studying its coasts in de-
tail, and showed it to be an
island with an area of
about 18,000 square miles.
It was the most southerly
piece of land to have been
reached by prehistorical hu-
manity. Its southernmost
point is named Cape Horn,
after the Dutch city of
Hoorn, where the ship's
captain, Willem Cornelis-
zoon Schouten (ca. 1580—
1625), was born.

Stagecoaches

A stagecoach is any horse
and carriage that travels be-
tween set places (stages) ac-
cording to a fixed timetable
and accepts passengers for
pay. Such things came into
use at about this time.
Stagecoaches allowed
people without money
enough to own a horse to
be carried from one place

to another more quickly
than in any other way.
There were disadvantages,
of course. You had to ride
with strangers, at a time
and to a place that suited
the coach-owners and not
necessarily yourself. Never-
theless, it was much more
convenient than having to
walk or try to hitch a ride
in a farmer’s cart.

The stagecoach re-

mained the fastest means of
overland travel (for the rela-
tively impecunious) for
over two centuries.

The English philosopher

Francis Bacon (1561-1626)
