Hydrogen and
Water

On January 15, 1784, Cav-
endish, still studying hydro-
gen (see 1766), noted that if
it was burned in a con-
tainer, liquid drops ap-
peared in the cooler
portions of that container.
On investigation, the liquid
turned out to be water. The
conclusion was that hydro-
gen combined with oxygen
to form water. When Lavoi-
sier heard that, he gave the
gas its present name of hy-
drogen, from Greek words
meaning “‘water-former.”

Martian Ice
Caps
In 1784 Herschel, who had
determined the axial incli-
nation of Mars (see 1781)

and therefore knew where
its polar regions were, no-
ticed that it had visible ice
caps in those polar regions.
Here was another similar-
ity between Mars and
Earth.

Alaska

After Bering's discovery of
the Bering Strait (see 1728),
Russians from Siberia, ven-
turing eastward, found
large numbers of sea otters,
whose pelts proved very
profitable. In 1784 the Rus-
sians established the first
European settlement in
Alaska, and for the next
eighty years Russian hold-
ings expanded until all of
the present-day state of
Alaska was part of the Rus-
sian Empire.

Tellurium

An Austrian mineralogist,
Franz Joseph Muller (1740—
1825), was working with
gold ore in 1782. In his stud-
ies, he produced a sub-
stance that he thought
might be an as-yet-un-
known element. Feeling un-
equal to the task of settling
the matter, he sent the sub-
stance to a German chem-
ist, Martin Heinrich
Klaproth (1743—1817), for
investigation. In 1784 Klap-
roth confirmed that the
material was a new ele-
ment, named it tellurium
(from a Latin word for
“earth”), and was careful to
give [ull credit for the dis-
covery to Muller.
