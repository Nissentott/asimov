cretorum Naturae (Academy
of the Mysteries of Nature).
It was closed down by the
Inquisition, which was
oversensitive to any gather-

1565

ings in those harsh days of
religious conflict, but the
idea was too goad to let go,
and other scientific socie-
ties were formed in time,
and persisted.

These societies helped
give rise to a scientific com-
munity that was as superior
to an individual scientist as
a phalanx or legion was to
an individual soldier.

 

Musket

By this time, the harquebus
had been refined to a mus-
ket. The word is from the
Latin word for â€œfly" and
had earlier been applied to
the bolts of crossbows, per-
haps because the crossbow

bolt or the musket ball
whizzed past one's ear with
the buzz of a fly.

Muskets could fire balls
that penetrated armor, so
armor began to disappear.
There was no use in bear-
ing the weight if it offered
no protection.

For two centuries, mus-
kets remained the principle
small arms used by sol-
diers, but they were still dif-
ficult to handle and reload
and musketeers needed the
protection of pikebearers.
