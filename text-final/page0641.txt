Miranda

For almost a century, Ura-
nus had been known to
have four satellites. In
1948, however, Kuiper,
who had described the at-
mosphere of Mars (see
1947), located a fifth Ura-
nian satellite. It was
smaller than the other four
and closer to Uranus. Since
three of the satellites had
been named for spirits from
Shakespeare's plays—Ob-
eron and Titania from A
Midsummer Night's Dream
and Ariel from The Tempest
—Kuiper named the new
satellite Miranda, alter the
heroine of The Tempest.
Miranda was the first
satellite to be named after
a human being rather than
a god, a goddess, or a spirit,
although it was a fictional
human being, to be sure.

Nucleic Acid-
Base Balance

It was now known that nu-
cleic acids were large and
very complex molecules, es-
pecially since Avery had
shown that deoxyribonu-
cleic acid (DNA) and not
protein was the carrier of
physical characteristics
(see 1944). It was DNA, in
short, that made up the
genes of the chromosomes.
The question was: Just
what was it about the struc-

ture of nucleic acids that
made it possible for them
to carry the vast amount of
information that genes
must carry in order to
make human eggs develop
into human beings and
grasshopper eggs into grass-
hoppers, without the re-
verse ever happening?

Part of the structure of
DNA was known to be four
different bases. Two of
them (adenine and gua-
nine) were purines with a
two-ring molecule, and two
of them (cytosine and thy-
mine) were pyrimidines
with a one-ring molecule.

The Austrian-born
American biochemist
Erwin Chargaff (b. 1905)
broke down nucleic acid
molecules to their constit-
uent bases and separated
them by paper chromatog-
raphy. He determined the
quantity of each present
and by 1948 was able to
demonstrate that, in nu-
cleic acids generally, the
number of guanine units
was equal to the number of
cytosine units, and the
number of adenine units
was equal to the number of
thymine units. This meant
that the number of purine
units was equal to the num-
ber of pyrimidine units.

This was a more im-
portant discovery than
Chargaff apparently real-
ized at the time, and he did
not follow it up properly.

Cyanoco-
balamine

Minot and Murphy had
demonstrated that there
was a dictary factor in liver
that reversed the onslaught
of pernicious anemia (see
1926). The nature of the fac-
tor was not casily deter-
mined, however, since its
presence or absence could
only be detected by follow-
ing the slow changes in per-
nicious anemia patients,

In 1948, the American
chemist Karl August Folk-
ers (b. 1906) discovered
that this factor, usually
called vitamin B-12, was
necessary for the growth of
certain bacteria. The pres-
ence or absence of the vita-
min in various fractions of
liver could now easily be de-
termined from the reaction
of bacteria, and very soon,
red crystals of the pure vita-
min were isolated.

Eventually, analysis
showed the vitamin to have
perhaps the most compli-
cated molecule known that
was not simply a long
chain of repeated single
units. It was required by
the body in exceedingly
small doses, a thousandth
that of other vitamins. The
molecule possessed a cva-
nide group and a cobalt
atom, neither of which was
present in other known sub-
stances in living tissue. For
