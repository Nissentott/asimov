1829

 

Nicol Prism

Biot had noted that the
plane of polarized light
seemed to twist when it
passed through certain or-
ganic compounds that were
liquid or in solution (see
1815), but the fact was of lit-
tle use without some sim-
ple method of measuring
this twist accurately.

In 1829 the Scottish
physicist William Nicol
(1768-1851) devised a use-
ful instrument in this con-
nection by cementing two
crystals of Iceland spar to-

gether with Canadian bal-
sam. He put them together
in such a way that one of
the two rays of light re-
fracted by the first crystal
was reflected out of the side
of the crystal at the layer of
balsam, while the ather,
striking the balsam at a
slightly different angle,
passed through to the other
end of the crystal.

The one beam that ap-
peared at the other end of
the Nicol prism could then
pass through a second
Nicol prism without being
weakened, if the second

prism was lined up parallel
to the first. If the polarized
light was then allowed to
pass through a container of
organic liquid or solution
that was placed between
the prisms, and if the plane
of polarization was twisted
as a result, then the second
prism would have to be
turned to allow the beam
through at maximum
brightness. The degree of
twist could be easily mea-
sured, and polarimetry be-
came a practical technique.
