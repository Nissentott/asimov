Neurospora

Often genetics take
forward with the introduc-
tion of a simpler organism
for study, as
for 1 , when Mor
began to study fruit flies
(see 1907).

The American geneti-
cist George Wells B
(1903-1989), in collabora-
tion with the American bio-
chemist Edward Lawrie
Tatum (1909—-1975), began
to work in 1941 with a
mold called Neurosp
cra

In the wild state, this
mold will grow on a nutri-
ent medium in which sug
is the only significant or-
ganic compound. For its
supply of elements not pres-

Beadle found that it
was not alv necessary
to add the missing co

meant that the similar cor

trying a variety of similar

A mutation took place
when a gene was so altered
that it could no longer form
a normal enzyme.

For this rk, Beadle
and Tatum were awarded a
share of the Nobel Prize for
