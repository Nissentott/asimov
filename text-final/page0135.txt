Drake Strait

The English navigator Fran-
cis Drake (1540 or 1543—
1596) had made a career
out of raiding the Spanish
possessions in the Americas
in the course of an unde-
clared war between En-
gland and Spain. It
occurred to him that the
Spanish settlements on the
Pacific coast of the Ameri-
cas were entirely unde-
fended because none of
Spain’s enemies had made
their way into the Pacific,
soin 1572 he had landed at
Panama, crossed the Isth-
mus, and became the first
Englishman to see the Pa-
cific.

1581

In 1577 he set sail on
an expedition that he
hoped would carry him
through the Strait of Magel-
lan, which so far only Span-
ish ships had passed
through. No one knew the
exact extent of Tierra del
Fuego, the land south of the
strait, and some thought it
was part of a vast Antarctic
continent.

Drake passed through
the Strait of Magellan in
1578 and was then struck
by a storm in the Pacific
and driven far enough
south to see that open
water lay to the south of
Tierra del Fuego, which
turned out to be nothing
more than a moderately

sized island. The water to
the south of that island has
been known as Drake Pas-
sage, or Drake Strait, ever
since.

Drake sailed up the Pa-
cific coast of the Americas
as far as what we now call
San Francisco Bay. He
found no water route that
would connect with the At-
lantic Ocean, so he decided
to sail westward across the
Pacific. He reached En-
gland in 1580, the first per-
son to circumnavigate the
globe since Magellan's ship
had done so six decades ear-
lier (see 1523).

 

Pendulum

In measuring time intervals
of less than a day, the point
is to find some physical ac-
tion that proceeds at a con-
stant rate. The sifting of
sand or the dripping of
water through a small hole,
the burning of a candle, or
the progress of the Sun
across the sky are all fairly
constant motions, but
might there not be some

convenient action that was
even more steadily con-
stant?

The first hint of a con-
stant action that was un-
known to the ancients came
in 1581, when a seventeen-
year-old Italian boy, Gali-
leo Galilei (1564—-1642),
who is usually known by
his first name, was at-
tending services at the Ca-
thedral of Pisa.

His attention was

caught by a chandelier that
swayed as air currents
caught it. Sometimes it
swung through a small arc,
sometimes through a larger
one, but to Galileo's inquir-
ing mind, there scemed an
anomaly: long or short, the
time it took the chandelier
to complete its swing back
and forth scemed the same.
He timed it by the beating
of his pulse. Upon re-
turning home, he set up
