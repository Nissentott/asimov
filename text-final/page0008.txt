metals. In short, fire intro-
duced humanity’s first age
of comparatively “high-
tech.”

To begin with, of
course, fire could be ob-
tained only after it had
been started by natural
means. Once one had a fire,
it had to be kept burning
continuously, and if it ever
died out, the search for an-
other fire had to be insti-
tuted at once. If there was
not a nearby tribe from

200,000 B.C.

 

which fire could be ob-
tained (assuming they were
friendly enough to grant it
—and they probably would
be, for it might be their
turn next) then it would be
necessary to wait for a natu-
ral fire again and hope that
conditions would be such
that some could be taken
safely.

The time came, how-
ever, when techniques were
developed for starting a fire
where none had been be-

fore. This could be done by
friction: by turning a
pointed stick in a depres-
sion in another stick, a de-
pression that contained
very dry shreds of wood,
leaves, or fungus (tinder).
The heat of friction might
eventually ignite the tinder.
We don'’t know when such
methods were first devel-
oped, but the technique for
starting a fire represents an-
other enormous step for-
ward.

By 200,000 B.c., the last in-
dividuals who might be
considered members of
Homo erectus were dead

and the species was extinct.

By then, though, some had
evolved into hominids
whose brains were every
bit as large as ours, al-
though they were some-
what differently
proportioned, less massive
in front and more massive
in the rear. They had first
appeared not long before
this time and were proba-
bly instrumental in bring-
ing about the end of the
older species.

The first traces of such
hominids were discovered
in 1856, in the valley of the
Neander River in western

Germany. Neander Valley
is Neanderthal in German,
and the skeletal remains
were referred to as Neander-
thal man at first, or simply
Neanderthals.

These were the first
hominids to be discovered.
They were clearly different
from modern human be-
ings. Their skulls were dis-
tinctly less human than our
own. They had pronounced
eyebrow ridges, large teeth,
protruding jaws, and reced-
ing foreheads and chins.

Because they were the
first hominids to be discov-
ered, and because the West-
ern world still believed
strongly that the Earth was
only a few thousand years
old (as the Bible seemed to
imply), there was a certain
reluctance to accept the Ne-

anderthal bones as remains
of an early form of Homo sa-
piens. Some preferred to
consider them remains of
ordinary members of Homo
sapiens who were suffering
from some sort of bone dis-
ease or other abnormality.

When more examples
of Neanderthal skeletons
were found and all had the
same kind of skulls, how-
ever, the notion of abnor-
mality could not be
maintained. The French an-
thropologist Paul Broca
(1824—1880) marshalled the
arguments in favor of Nean-
derthals being a more prim-
itive form of life than we
ourselves, and that turned
the tide.

The formal name for
the Neanderthals was at
first Homo neandertha-
