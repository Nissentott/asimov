Slide Rules

[t was not long after the dis-
covery of logarithms by Na-
pier (see 1614) that the
matter became mecha-
nized. An English mathe-
matician, William
Oughtred (1574—1660), pre-

pared two rulers along
which logarithmic scales
were laid off. By manipulat-
ing the rulers one against
the other, calculations
could be performed me-
chanically by means of log-
arithms.

The instrument, modi-

fied and improved, became
the slide rule that scientists
and engineers carried
about with them constantly
until it was replaced three
and a half centuries later
by pocket computers.

Gas

Air was considered by the
Greeks to be one of the four
elements that made up the
Earth. To them, and to
those who followed them,
any vapor was a kind of air.
The Flemish physician
Jan Baptista van Helmont
(1579—1644) worked with

vapors, however, and it
seemed clear to him that
some vapors had properties
so different from others,
and from ordinary air, that
they represented different
substances. Just as there
were different liquids and
solids, so there were differ-
ent airs.

In 1624 Helmont felt he

needed a word to use for
such airs generally. It
seemed to him that since
airs had no specific volume
but filled any container,
they were examples of mat-
ter in complete chaos. He
called them chaos, spelling
the word according to its
pronunciation in Flemish
so that it came out gas. The
