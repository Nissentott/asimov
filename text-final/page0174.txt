Boyleâ€™s Law

As Boyle experimented
with vacuums, it was he
who employed Robert
Hooke to build an im-
proved air pump (see 1657).

The air pump got Boyle
interested in gases, and in
1662 he discovered that air
could be compressed. He
did this by trapping some
air in the short closed end
of a J-shaped 17-foot-long
glass tube into which he
poured mercury to close off
the bottom curve.

If he next added more
mercury to the open end,
the weight of the additional
mercury squeezed the
trapped air in the closed
end more closely together,
and its volume decreased.
Indeed, Boyle found that
the volume of the gas var-
ied inversely with the pres-
sure upon it. That is, if he
doubled the weight of mer-
cury upon it, the volume
shrank to one-half the origi-
nal; if he tripled the weight

of mercury, the volume
shrank to one-third, and so
on. This is called Boyle's
Law.

The most important
conclusion of this experi-
ment was that air, and pre-
sumably other gases, were
atomic in nature and that
the atoms were widely
spread apart. With pres-
sure, the atoms were forced
more closely together and
the volume shrank.

Liquids and solids
could not be compressed
with the same ease that
gases could be, but that did
not necessarily mean they

weren't composed of atoms.

In their cases, the atoms
might already be in con-
tact.

The idea of atomism
had not entirely died out
since the time of Democri-
tus (see 440 B.c.). There had
always been a few from
time to time who accepted
atoms. Boyle's experi-
ments, however, were the
strongest evidence yet, and

Boyle himself became a
convinced atomist. It was
to be a century and a half,
however, before atomism
won out entirely.

Royal Society

There had been informal
meetings of scientists in
London in the mid-1600s,
and the habit grew more in-
grained after the Restora-
tion (of Charles 11, that is).
Like many monarchs of
his time, Charles II patron-
ized science as a way of
gaining prestige for the na-
tion and possibly material
benefit as well. He there-
fore gave a legal charter to
the Royal Society in 1662.
For years, it represented
the most brilliant assem-
blage of scientists since the
great days of Alexandria.
The Royal Society re-
ceived communications
from members, both at
home and abroad, and held
meetings where members
could inform one another of
