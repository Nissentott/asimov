Insulin

By this time it seemed clear
that the serious disease of
diabetes mellitus had some-
thing to do with the pan-
creas; removal of the
pancreas from experimen-
tal animals invariably pro-
duced a diabeteslike
condition.

Once the hormone con-
cept had been propounded
by Starling (see 1902 and
1905), it was easily as-
sumed that some hormone
produced by the pancreas
exerted control over carbo-
hydrate metabolism. In the
absence of the hormone,
carbohydrate metabolism
went out of control, with
the result that glucose built
up in the blood and spilled
out in the urine. A variety
of unpleasant symptoms
made themselves manifest
—with death as the end.

To be sure, it was well
established that the chief
function of the pancreas
was to produce protein-di-
gesting enzymes, but there
were portions of the pan-
creas that seemed different
from the rest. These por-
tions, scattered through the
pancreatic background,
were the Islets of Langer-
hans (see 1869). Some sus-

pected that the islets
produced the necessary hor-
mone, and there were sug-
gestions that the hormone
be called insulin, from the
Latin word for “island.”

No one had managed
to isolate the hormone from
pancreatic tissue, however.
This was not surprising,
since if insulin were protein
in nature (as indeed it
turned out to be), the diges-
tive enzymes in the pan-
creas would digest and
destroy it before it could be
isolated.

The Canadian physi-
cian Frederick Grant Ban-
ting (1891—1941) had read
that if the pancreatic duct
was tied off in a living ani-
mal, the pancreatic tissue
degenerated. The Islets of
Langerhans, however,
whose hormone product
would not then be dis-
charged through the duct
but secreted directly into
the bloodstream, were not
affected. Then why not at-
tempt to isolate insulin
from a degenerated pan-
creas, in which no digestive
enzymes would exist to
spoil the extraction?

In 1921 Banting man-
aged to obtain space at the
University of Toronto and
to get the services of an as-

sistant, the American-born
Canadian physiologist
Charles Herbert Best
(1899-1978). Together Ban-
ting and Best tied off the
pancreatic ducts in a num-
ber of dogs and waited
seven weeks for the pan-
creas to degenerate. They
then extracted a solution
that quickly stopped the
symptoms of diabetes. They
had insulin.

As a result, Banting
was awarded a share of the
Nobel Prize for medicine
and physiology in 1923.

Vagusstoffe

It was well known by this
time that the nerve impulse
was electrical in nature.
The German-born Ameri-
can pharmacologist Otto
Loewi (1873-1961) felt that
chemicals were involved,
too, especially where the
nerve impulse had to jump
the tiny gap (or synapse)
from one nerve cell to an-
other.

In 1921, working with
the nerves attached to a
frog’s heart, particularly
the vagus nerve, he showed
that chemical substances
were indeed set free when
the nerve was stimulated,
