Land Bridges

In the book of Genesis, God
is described as separating
land and sea on the third

French geologist, Nicolas
Desmarest (1725-1815),

of the channel shores of En-
gland and France and sug-

a land bridge between
them once, a bridge now

shape. Desmarest thought
such changes were brought
about by earthquakes,
which was not a bad idea,
but it was wrong.

Halley’'s Comet

A little over half a century
before, Halley had pre-

Palitzsch (1723—1788) set
up his telescope and

trained it on the part of the

1758, he spotted it, and
