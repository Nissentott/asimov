did not mix into a blind av-
erage, but continued to
show up, they provided the
mechanism by which natu-
ral selection could bring
about a gradual change in
species. Thus, Mendel cor-
rected the flaw in Darwin,
but both Mendel and Dar-
win were dead before the
world of science came to re-
alize what had happened.

Benzene Ring

Kekule's way of writing
chemical formulas (see
1858) did not solve all prob-
lems. There was one com-
pound, benzene, which was
extremely important, being
involved in the molecular
structure of the new artifi-
cial dyes, for instance (see
1856), that did not yield to
his system.

The molecule of ben-
zene is made up of six
carbon atoms and six
hydrogen atoms. Given a
chain of six carbon atoms,
there seemed to be no way
of adding six hydrogen
atoms without producing a
very unstable compound—
and benzene was quite sta-
ble.

It was Kekule himself
who found the answer in
1865. According to his own
story, he was in a semidoze
in a horse-drawn bus and
was visualizing carbon
chains when suddenly the
tail end of one chain

attached itself to the head
end and formed a spinning
ring. At once he saw that if
he imagined the six carbon
atoms forming a hexagonal
ring, with one hydrogen
atom attached to each car-
bon, a stable atom might be
the result. Once the notion
of carbon rings was added
to that of carbon chains,
many structural problems
were solved.

Avogadro’s
Number

The hydrogen molecule is
composed of two hydrogen
atoms. The hydrogen atom
has an atomic weight of
Jjust about 1, so that a hy-
drogen molecule has a
molecular weight of 2.
Hydrogen gas is made up of
hydrogen molecules, and at
0° C and normal atmo-
spheric pressure at sea
level, 22 4 liters (5.9 gal-
lons) of hydrogen gas weigh
2 grams. This is the molecu-
lar weight in grams, or 1
mole.

Since equal volumes of
gases are made up of equal
numbers of molecules, ac-
cording to Avogadro’s hy-
pothesis (see 1811), and
since each oxygen molecule
has a weight of 32, then
22 4 liters of oxygen gas
would weigh 32 grams—or
1 mole.

In fact, 224 liters of

271

any gas are likely to weigh
1 mole.

The question is, how
many molecules are there
in 224 liters of a gas? In
1865 the Austrian chemist
Johann Joseph Loschmidt
(1821-1895) used Max-
well’s kinetic theory of
gases (see 1859) to cal-
culate what that number
ought to be. It turned
out to be about
600,000,000,000,000,000,000,000,
or six hundred billion tril-
lion. Since all this was
based on Avogadro’s hy-
pothesis, the number was
called Avogadro's number.

From Avogadro’s num-
ber, you could calculate the
actual mass of a hydrogen
molecule, since it would be
2 grams divided by six hun-
dred billion trillion. A hy-
drogen atom would have a
mass half that, and the
mass of other atoms and
molecules could be calcu-
lated as well.

For the first time, scien-
tists had a notion, and a
rather good one, as it
turned out, of the mass of
the tiny atoms and mole-
cules that made up matter.
