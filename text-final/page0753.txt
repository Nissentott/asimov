Then in April 1992,
American astrophysicist
George Fitzgerald Smoot
(b. 1945), who headed
COBE’s team of analysts,
announced that the satel-
lite’s radiometers had
found fluctuations in the
background radiation. The
fluctuations, preserved
from a time 300,000 years
after the big bang, proved
there were spots in the cool-
ing primordial soup that
were very slightly cooler
(denser) and hotter (less
dense) than others. These
variations caused gravita-
tional differences that gave
rise to the clumping to-
gether of matter as stars,
galaxies, and larger cosmic
structures began to form.

Two theories related to
the concept of the big bang
benefited from COBE's
findings. In explaining the
formation of cosmic struc-
tures and particularly in
noting very small fluctua-
tions in the background ra-
diation, COBE supported
the idea of an inflationary
Universe (see 1977).

The data on the clump-

ing together of primordial
matter also corroborated
the theory of dark matter, in-
visible or transparent mat-
ter that does not interact
with matter as we know it
and that astrophysicists
have been studying since
the 1970s. Radiating little
or no detectable energy,
dark matter is thought
nevertheless to exert grav-
itational effects on sur-
rounding bodies, and some
scientists believe it played
an important role in the for-
mation of galaxies. Ac-
cording to some theories,
the amount of dark matter
in the Universe is a key ele-
ment in determining if it
will continue to expand or
eventually start con-
tracting.

Larger Role for
RNA

For decades, cell scientists
believed that proteins act-
ing as enzymes carried out
the functional activities in
living tissue and that RNA
acted only as a messenger

molecule (see 1956, Ribo-
somes and Transfer RNA).
Then in the early 1980s
American biologist Thomas
Robert Cech (b. 1947) and
Canadian-born biologist
Sidney Altman (b. 1939)
showed that a type of bacte-
rial RNA they called a ribo-
zyme could act like an
enzyme and restructure it-
self. For their discovery,
Cech and Altman won the
1989 Nobel Prize in Chemis-
try.

In the spring of 1992,
American biologist Harry
Francis Noller (b. 1939)
eliminated the protein com-
ponent from a ribosomal
RNA to observe the effect
as RNA encountered amino
acids, the building blocks
of protein. Acting alone,
RNA was able to string to-
gether the amino acids.
Also in 1991, Cech’s labora-
tory reported similar activ-
ity in ribozymes. This
meant that RNA was more
important in protein syn-
thesis—and therefore more
fundamental to the life pro-
cess—than had been real-
ized.
