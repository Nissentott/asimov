of the Sun. From those
lines, one could be sure that
sodium existed in the Sun’s
atmosphere, and half a
dozen other elements as
well.

This was the first ac-
tual observation indicating
that the same chemical ele-
ments that existed on Earth
existed also on other as-
tronomical bodies, and
therefore presumably
throughout the Universe.

Solar Flares

The British astronomer
Richard Christopher Car-
rington (1826—1875) mea-
sured the Sun's rotation by
the motion of the sunspots.
Galileo had done that two
and a half centuries before,
but Carrington could work
with more delicate instru-
ments. He found that the
Sun did not rotate all in a
piece, which meant that it
was not a solid body, but
that the outer regions, at
least, might well be gas-
eous. (In view of the temper-
ature of the Sun's surface,
this was not surprising.) A
point on the solar equator
took 25 days to make one
turn around the Sun, while
at solar latitude 45 degrees,
a point that had to travel a
considerably smaller dis-
tance to make the turn, it
took 27'% days.

On September 1, 1859,

Carrington, watching the
sunspots, observed a star-
like point of light burst out
of the Sun's surface. It
lasted 5 minutes and sub-
sided. Carrington specu-
lated that a large meteor
had fallen into the Sun, but
it was eventually realized
that he had been the first to
see a solar flare, a brief but
violent explosion that was
usually associated with sun-
spots. This was the begin-
ning of an understanding
that when the number of
sunspots was high, we had
an “active Sun” and when
it was low, a “quiet Sun.”

Kinetic Theory
of Gases

Maxwell, having worked on
the small particles that
made up Saturn's rings (see
1857), turned in 1859 to
other, even smaller parti-
cles—the molecules that
made up gases. Maxwell
treated the situation statis-
tically, assuming that the
molecules moved in ran-
dom directions at random
speeds and bounced off the
walls of a container, and off
each other, with perfect
elasticity.

Eventually he worked
out mathematical relation-
ships that showed the dis-
tribution of velocities
among the molecules of a
gas at a particular tempera-

ture. A few molecules
moved very slowly and a
few very quickly, but larger
percentages moved at inter-
mediate velocities, with the
most common velocity
somewhere in the middle. A
rise in temperature caused
the average velocity to rise,
while a drop in tempera-
ture caused it to fall. In fact
temperature—and heat it-
self—could be pictured as
molecular movement and
nothing else. This is called
the kinetic theory of gases,
where kinetic is from the
Greek word for “motion.”

From the random mo-
tion of the molecules, the
various laws involving
gases could be deduced
(Boyle's law—see 1662;
Charles's law—see 1787),
but they were obeyed statis-
tically. That is, gases might
act quite differently from
the way they do by chance
deviation from the normal.
However, there are so
many molecules that statis-
tical deviations involving
more than a vanishingly
small percentage of them
are enormously improba-
ble.

In the same way, as
Maxwell pointed out, gases
can defy the second law of
thermodynamics if all the
molecules happen to move
in the same direction, or all
the faster molecules gain
still more speed from the
slower ones—but the
