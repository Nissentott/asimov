would be that their concen-
tration could be accurately
determined even when they
were present in trace quan-
tities, thanks to the radia-
tions they emitted.

In 1918 Hevesy decided
to make use of a radioac-
tive isotope of lead, formed
by uranium breakdown.
This radiolead was identical
in chemical properties to
ordinary stable lead. Sup-
pose, then, he were to add a
small quantity of radiolead
to lead and use the mixture
to produce certain lead
compounds.

These lead compounds
are only slightly soluble in
water, so that one could not
measure the concentration
of the dissolved stable lead
with anything approaching
acecuracy. If, however, a
lead compound with ra-
diolead added is stirred in
water so that a tiny frac-
tion of the molecules dis-
solve, that same tiny
fraction of the molecules
containing radio-lead also
dissolves. The amount of ra-
dio-lead in solution can
then be easily and accu-
rately determined, and the
percentage of radiolead
compound dissolved will be
the same as that of the ordi-
nary lead compound.

In later years, Hevesy
followed the manner in
which plants absorbed and
distributed water by spik-
ing it with a tiny quantity

 

of radiolead compound that
he could follow accurately.

As long as radioactive
tracing was confined to
lead, it could only play a
minor role, of course. Nev-
ertheless, Hevesy had
pointed out the potential of
the technique, and the time
was to come when it was to
be a superb and essential
tool for biochemists and
others.

For this, and for other
work, Hevesy was awarded
the Nobel Prize for chemis-
try in 1943.

Organizer

The German zoologist Hans
Spemann (1869-1941) was
interested in the develop-
ment of embryos. Thirty
years later, it had been
shown that if the fertilized
ovum of a test animal was
divided in two, and if one of
the resulting cells was
killed with a hot needle,
then the remaining cell
would evolve into a longitu-
dinal half of an embryo.
The act of dividing in two
had established the plane
of bilateral symmetry.

If, however, a fertilized
ovum divided in two and
the two resulting cells were
separated and each allowed
to develop, each would
form a complete (though
smaller than normal) em-
bryo. (It is this which re-
sults in the birth of

identical twins among
human beings, for in-
stance.)

To Spemann, the differ-
ence between a cell that de-
veloped from a divided
fertilized ovum and one
that developed while
attached to a dead partner
indicated that the individ-
ual cells of an embryo af-
fected each other.

In a series of experi-
ments, Spemann showed
that even after an embryo
had begun to show definite
signs of differentiation, it
could still be divided in
half, with each half produc-
ing a whole embryo. This
showed that cells remained
plastic until quite late in
the game.

Spemann found that an
embryo develops according
to the nature of neigh-
boring areas. An eyeball de-
velops originally out of
brain material and is
joined by a lens that devel-
ops out of nearby skin. If
the eyeball is placed near a
distant section of the skin,
one that would never in the
course of nature develop a
lens, it nevertheless begins
to develop one.

There were apparently
organizers in the embryo
that brought about certain
developments nearby. For
his work, Spemann was
awarded the Nobel Prize
for medicine and physiol-
ogy in 1935.
