Steam Engine

For half a century, the New-
comen steam engine had
been used by miners de-
spite its inefficiency. In
1764, a steam engine of this
sort was given to a Scottish
engineer, James Watt
(1736-1819), to repair.

The repair was easy,
but Watt wanted to im-

prove it. He had learned of
latent heat from his friend
Black (see 1762), and he re-
alized how wasteful it was
to keep heating, cooling,
and reheating the same
chamber. The thought
came to him, then, of hav-
ing two chambers. One
would always be kept hot
and the other would always
be kept cold. While the

steam was doing its work,
it would be in the hot cham-
ber, and when it had to be
condensed, a system of
valves would bleed it into
the cold chamber for con-
densation while more
steam was formed in the
hot chamber. That was the
beginning of the first rea-
sonably efficient steam en-
gine.
