Crossbows

The greater the force with
which a bow must be bent,
the greater the force with
which the arrow will be
sent forth when the tension
is released. The greater the
force of the shot, the
greater the range and the
penetrating power. Natu-
rally, the larger the bow, or
the stiffer, the better—ex-
cept that eventually human
muscle doesn't suffice for
pulling back the string of
the bow.

 

1054

In France, sometime
about 1050, machinery was
brought into play: the bow
was drawn back by a two-
handed crank or the equiva-
lent. Eventually the bows
were made of steel, and a
short bolt was shot out that
had a range of about 1,000
feet and could penetrate
chain mail.

This was the first mech-
anized hand weapon, and
the bolt it shot forth
seemed so terrifying that
the weapon seemed too
horrible to use. At least a

Church council of 1139
tried to ban its use except
against non-Christians.
(The ban didn't work.)

The chief disadvantage
of the crossbow was its
slowness. It took a long
time to crank it up and
make ready to shoot and
once it was fired, the enemy
might easily swoop down
before it could be cocked
again. (Hence the expres-
sion “to have shot their
bolt,” meaning to have
taken action and to be help-
less thereafter.)

 

New Star

Hipparchus was supposed
to have seen a new star
some twelve centuries be-
fore (see 134 B.c.), but no
European had seen one
since, though Chinese as-
tronomers had reported a
number of new stars in that
interval.

On July 4, 1054, a

bright new star blazed
forth in the constellation of
Taurus. For three weeks it
shone so brightly it could
be seen in daylight. At its
peak, it was two or three
times as bright as Venus at
its brightest and could cast
a dim shadow. It remained
visible for nearly two years
before finally fading away
into invisibility.

This new star was re-
corded by the Chinese as-
tronomers, but in Europe it
went unnoted (or at least
no reference to it has sur-
vived). This is an indication
of the low state of astron-
omy, and of science gener-
ally, in Europe, which was
just then emerging from a
five-century-long Dark Age.
