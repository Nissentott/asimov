Transverse Light
Waves

Young had demonstrated
that light consisted of tiny
waves but thought they
might be longitudinal
waves, like those of sound
(see 1801). In 1818, the
French physicist Augustin-
Jean Fresnel (1788-1827)
published a treatise that
considered transverse light
waves in a detailed mathe-
matical way and showed
that such waves would ac-
count for reflection, refrac-
tion, and diffraction just as
well as longitudinal waves
would.

What’s more, trans-
verse waves could easily ex-
plain the manner in which
Iceland spar divided a
beam of light into two
beams that were each re-
fracted by a different
amount. It also explained
polarized light (see 1808),
which longitudinal waves
could not explain.

Ordinary, unpolarized
light has waves that oscil-
late in all directions that
are at right angles to its di-
rection of propagation—up
and down, side to side;, and
everything in between.
Light that passes through

certain crystals is forced to
oscillate in just two direc-
tions, one at right angles to
the other. This is polarized
light. (This is analogous to
making waves in a long
rope. The wave can be
made to move up and
down, side to side, and ev-
erything in between, If the
rope passes between the
slats of a picket fence, how-
ever, the only waves that
can pass through are those
that move up and down.)

Fresnel's analysis set-
tled the controversy over
the nature of light, at least
for the time being.

Encke’s Comet

Since Halley had predicted
the return of Halley’s
comet (see 1705), no other
cometary orbit had been
worked out, and no other
comet’s return had been
predicted.

In 1818, however, the
German astronomer Jo-
hann Franz Encke (1791 —
1865) worked out the orbit
of a comet that had been ob-
served the year before by
the French astronomer
Jean-Louis Pons (1761—
1831). The comet has been
called Encke’s comet ever
since, the name going to

the orbit-establisher rather
than to the discoverer.

Encke’s comet, the sec-
ond to have its orbit estab-
lished, returned to the
neighborhood of the Sun
every three and a third
years. It was the first short-
period comet known and, in-
deed, to this day no comet
has been discovered with a
smaller orbit. Encke’s
comet was the first to be vis-
ible throughout its orbit,
and this went far to de-
crease the mystery of com-
ets. It is, of course, a very
dim comet, since repeated
approaches to the Sun have
drained it of the material
that goes into the forming
of the tail. Nowadays it has
just a trace of the fuzziness
that reveals it to be a
comet.

Atomic Weights

Berzelius (see 1803) was
one of those who labored to
determine atomic weights,
and no one in his time was
as careful as he. He ran two
thousand analyses on vari-
ous chemicals after 1807
and used the results as a
basis for working out
atomic weights. In 1818 he
felt justified in publishing a
table of his results.
