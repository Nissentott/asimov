Diabetes

Many communicable dis-
eases had been described
and differentiated, but
there are also diseases that
are not communicable.
These are the result of some
inborn deficiency of the
body, which may make it-
self evident from birth or
only later in life.

Of these, the most im-
portant is diabetes, a disor-

1671

der in which the patient is
unable to process sugar in
the normal way. Sugar in a
diabetic tends to accumu-
late in the blood and spill
over into the urine.

Some of the ancient
physicians may have been
aware that the urine of dia-
betics was sweet, where
normal urine was not. It
may be that flies collecting
about diabetic urine gave
the first hint.

It was the English phy-
sician Thomas Willis
(1621-1675) who in 1670
was the first modern to
point out the sweetness.
Naturally, recognizing and
understanding symptoms is
a step toward learning how
to treat a disease, but
where diabetes was con-
cerned the treatment didn’t
come for a century and a

half.

 

Saturn’s
Satellites

By now, six satellites were
known: four circling Jupi-
ter (Io, Europa, Ganymede,
and Callisto), one circling
Saturn (Titan), and, of
course, one circling Earth
(Moon). Huygens (see 1656),
in an uncharacteristic mo-

ment of mysticism, thought
that the six satellites
matched the six planets in
number (Mercury, Venus,
Earth, Mars, Jupiter, and
Saturn), which balanced
things, so that no further
satellite discoveries were to
be expected.

Cassini (see 1665) blew
that view to smithereens in
1671 when he discovered a

second satellite of Saturn,
which he named Iapetus.
Over the next thirteen
years he discovered three
more: Rhea, Dione, and
Tethys. These names are
those of Titans: Iapetus was
a brother of Saturn
(Cronos), while the other
three were among his sis-
ters.
