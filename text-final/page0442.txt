Nitrogen

e o
Fixation
Plants must have nitrogen
atoms to build their tissues,
and they get them from ni-
trates in the soil. There are
enormous amounts of nitro-
gen in the atmosphere, but
nitrogen itself is not active,
and it is not easy to force it

into combination with
other substances.

The German chemist
Hermann Hellriegel (1831-
1895) discovered in 1886
that some leguminous
plants (peas, beans, and
related species) had root
nodules that contained
nitrogen-fixing bacteria (that
is, bacteria that could affix
nitrogen to other kinds of el-

ements, eventually forming
nitrates). Since there is al-
ways a danger that plants
will consume the nitrates
in soil, causing it to decline
in fertility, it was useful to
know that the planting of le-
guminous plants would re-
store the fertility of the soil
—at least with respect to ni-
trogen.

Michelson-
Morley
Experiment

Michelson, who had hoped
to determine the Earth's
speed of motion through
the stationary ether (see
1881), continued to im-
prove the delicacy of his
procedure and of his instru-
ments, and to repeat the ex-
periment. Finally, in 1887,
with the help of a col-
league, the American chem-
ist Edward Williams
Morley (1838-1923), Mi-

chelson ran a definitive ex-
periment and, once again,
found no interference
fringes.

There had to be an ex-
planation, Either the Earth
was motionless with re-
spect to the ether, or the
Earth dragged the ether
with it, or something. All
possible explanations
seemed highly unlikely,
and for nearly a quarter of
a century, the world of sci-
ence was completely puz-
zled. It took a scientific
revolution to explain
the matter, so that the

Michelson-Morley experi-
ment is perhaps the most
important “failure” in the
history of science.

Photoelectric
Effect

The German physicist Hein-
rich Rudolph Hertz (1857—
1894) was interested in
Maxwell's equations (see
1865). As part of his investi-
gation of electromagnetic
effects in the light of those
equations, he set up an elec-
trical circuit that oscil-
