 

gold, but perhaps as early
as 1669, he obtained a
white waxy substance that
glowed faintly in the air
and which he therefore
called phosphorus (from
Greek words meaning
“light-bearer”’). The faint
glow was due to the sponta-
neous combustion of phos-
phorus in air.

All the ninety or so ele-
ments discovered after
1669 can be attributed to a
specific person and a spe-
cific time. Brand’s discov-
ery of phosphorus is the
first of which this can be
said.

Fossils

The word fossil is from a
Latin word meaning “to
dig.” At first anything that
could be dug out of the
earth was called a fossil.
The word came to be ap-
plied, however, to those
particular objects that were
dug up and that, although
made of rock, seemed re-
markably like remnants of
living things—bones and
teeth particularly. Agricola
(see 1556) had commented
on these over a century ear-
lier.

There were numerous
theories about these fossils.
Some thought them prac-

tice attempts by God to cre-
ate living things. Some
thought them failing at-
tempts of Satan to imitate
God. Some thought them
the remains of animals that
had drowned in Noah's
Flood.

In 1669, however, the
Danish geologist Nicolaus
Steno (1636—1686) main-
tained that they were the re-
mains of creatures that had
lived long ago and whose re-
mains had slowly petrified;
that is, been converted into
stone. This view gradually
prevailed, and fossils were
to be the most spectacular
(though far from being the
only) evidence in favor of bi-
ological evolution.

Double
Refraction

Sometimes a discovery is
s0 puzzling it must simply
be put aside until science
advances to the point
where an explanation is
possible.

Thus, in 1669 a Danish
physician, Erasmus Bar-
tholin (1625-1698), ob-
tained a transparent crystal
of a type now called Iceland
spar. Bartholin noted that
objects viewed through the
crystal appeared double. It

was as though some light
were refracted by the crys-
tal through one angle, with
the rest refracted through a
slightly different angle. The
phenomenon was therefore
called double refraction.

Bartholin further no-
ticed that when he rotated
the crystal, one of the im-
ages remained fixed and
the other revolved about it.

Bartholin could not ex-
plain these observations,
and neither could anyone
else. The observations had
to remain in suspended ani-
mation for a century and a
half until enough was
known about light for an ex-
planation to become possi-
ble.

Blood Color

It was clear that blood
went to the lungs to pick up
air, and it was suspected
that this must involve a
chemical change in the
blood. The first to notice ev-
idence to that effect was an
English physician, Richard
Lower (1631-1691). In 1669
he noted that dark blood
drawn from veins turned
bright red on contact with
air. The necessary details
concerning the change had
to wait another century,
however.
