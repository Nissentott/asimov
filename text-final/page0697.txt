would probably be too
small to allow them to com-
bine.

Yet suppose there were
collisions. The three most
common atoms are hydro-
gen, helium, and oxygen.
Helium atoms don’t com-
bine with other atoms, but
two hydrogen atoms might
combine to form a hydro-
gen molecule, and a hydro-
gen and an oxygen atom
might combine to form a
hydroxyl group.

On Earth, a hydroxyl
group is so active that it
quickly combines with
other atoms. The result is
that such a group does not
exist in the free state on
Earth. In space, however,
the chances of a hydroxyl
group striking anything are
so small that it might accu-
mulate uncombined.

If so, hydroxyl groups
ought to emit microwaves
of characteristic wave-
lengths, and in 1963 two of
those wavelengths were de-
tected, indicating the pres-
ence of hydroxyl groups in
interplanetary space.

Woman in
Space

On June 18, 1963, with the
Space Age nearly six years
old, the Soviet Union
launched Vostok 6, bearing
Valentina Vladimirovna

Tereshkova (b. 1937), the
first woman to be placed
into orbit about the Earth.

Magnetic
Reversals

As early as 1906, the French
physicist Bernard Brunhes
had noted that in some
rocks, crystals magnetized
in directions opposite 1o
that of Earth’s magnetic
field. This was ignored at
first, but slowly it came to
be realized that the Earth’s
magnetic field strengthened
and weakened. The weaken-
ing might go all the way to
zero and then begin to
strengthen in the opposite
direction. It might be, then,
that magnetic reversals oc-
curred at intervals in
Earth'’s history.

If the Atlantic Ocean's
floor had spread with the
upwelling of magma in the
Global Rift (see 1960), then
the sediments laid down on
the sea bottom ought to
exist in strips. If magnetic
reversals had occurred,
these strips ought to reflect
them.

On investigation, this
turned out to be the case.
On either side of the rift
were sediments with nor-
mal magnetization, farther
away on either side were
sediments with reversed
magnetization, then nor-

mal again, then reversed,
and so on, quite symmetri-
cally on either side.

This offered the best ev-
idence so far for the exis-
tence of sea-floor spreading,
and also for the periodic re-
versal, at irregular inter-
vals, of the magnetic field.

Of course, if two adjoin-
ing plates are pushed apart,
two adjoining plates in
some other part of the
Earth must be pushed to-
gether. Thus the study of
plate tectonics finally made
sense out of mountain-
building, volcanoes and
earthquakes, the develop-
ment of ocean deeps and is-
land arcs. In short, plate
tectonics became the cen-
tral dogma of geology, as
evolution is of biology, the
atomic theory is of chemis-
try, and the conservation
laws are of physics.
