Wave
Mechanics

Three years earlier, de
Broglie had suggested that
particles such as electrons
might have wave aspects
(see 1923).

In 1926 an Austrian
physicist, Erwin Schro-
dinger (1887—1961), de-
cided that if the electron
was viewed as a wave
rather than as a particle,
Bohr's electron orbits (see
1913 and 1915) might make
more sense.

Schrédinger imagined
an atom in which the elec-
tron could be in any orbit,
provided that its matter-
waves would extend
around that orbit in an inte-
gral number of wave-
lengths. This would pro-
duce a standing wave and
therefore would not repre-
sent an electric charge in os-
cillation. The electron, as
long as it remained in such
an orbit, need not radiate
light and would not violate
the conditions of Maxwell’s
equations (see 1865).

Furthermore, the per-
missible orbits worked out
by Bohr and others all in-
volved whole wavelengths,
and the lowest orbit was
one that involved a single
wavelength. In this way,
Bohr's suggestions came to
make solid sense.

This view of Schro-
dinger's was called wave
mechanics, and it was soon
shown to be mathemati-
cally equivalent to Heisen-
berg's matrix mechanics of
the year before (see 1925).
However, Schradinger’s
waves seemed the more
attractive idea of the
two, because they did offer
the mind a picture of
the atom.

Schrodinger worked
out the mathematical un-
derpinnings of wave me-
chanics; a key relationship
that he presented is known
as the Schrodinger wave
equation.

For his work on wave
mechanics, Schrodinger
was awarded a share (along
with Dirac—see 1930) of
the Nobel Prize for physics
in 1933.

Wave Packets

Like Schradinger (see
above), the German physi-
cist Max Born (1882—1970)
tried to work out the impli-
cations of the electron
viewed as a wave. He gave
electron waves a probabilis-
tic interpretation: the rise
and fall of waves could be
taken to indicate the rise
and fall in probability that
the electron behaved as
though it was a particle ex-
isting at those points in the
wave packet.

He also worked on the
mathematical basis of such
a view. He, Schrodinger,
and Heisenberg (see 1925)
may be viewed as the inven-
tors of quantum mechanics,
which ever since has been
used to interpret chemistry
and subatomic physics
with remarkable success.
Quantum mechanics and
Einstein's relativity (see
1905 and 1916) are the two
great theoretical founda-
tions of twentieth-century
physics.

For his work on quan-
tum mechanics, Born was
