Space-Time

Einstein's theory of special
relativity (see 1905) forced
many physicists to recon-
sider their view of the Uni-
verse. It was clear from
Einstein's work that an or-
dinary three-dimensional
view of the Universe was in-
sufficient.

1908

The Russian-born Ger-
man mathematician Her-
mann Minkowski (1864â€”
1909) published Tinze and
Space in 1907. In it he dem-
onstrated that relativity
made it necessary to take
time into account as a kind
of fourth dimension
(treated mathematically
somewhat differently from
the three spatial dimen-
sions). Neither space nor
time had existed sepa-
rately, in Minkowski's

view, so that the Universe
consisted of a fused space-
time

Einstein adopted this
notion as he continued to
work on his theories. He
was trying to extend them
to accelerated motion in
order to take gravitational
interactions into account.

 

 

Atomic Size

Einstein had devised an
equation showing how one
might calculate the size of
atoms and molecules from
Brownian motion (see
1905). In 1908 Perrin, who
had shown that cathode

rays consisted of particles
carrying a negative electric
charge (see 1895), set about
making the calculation
Through a microscope,
he counted the number of
small particles of gum resin
suspended at different
heights in water. That they

were suspended at all was
the result of recoil from col-
lisions with water mole-
cules; in other words, from
Brownian motion. From his
observations and from Ein-
rrin
could make his determina-
tion.
