The action of lenses had
been known from ancient
times. Archimedes (see 260
B.c.), according to a doubt-
ful story, used large lenses
to focus sunlight and set
the Roman ships afire when
they were besieging Syra-
cuse. Obviously, light had
to be benl in passing
through them

The first to make a
mathematical study of this

was a Dutch mathemati-
cian, Willebrord Snel
(1580-1626)

It was known that
when a beam of light

 

passed from air to a denser
medium, such as
glass, and struck the sur
