Neptunium and
Plutonium

Fermi had tried to form ele-
ment number 93 by bom-
barding uranium with
neutrons (see 1934). Hahn
and Meitner had shown
that the result was nuclear
fission (see 1939). The two
were not mutually exclu-
sive, however. It was possi-
ble that some uranium
nuclei might undergo fis-

sion and others might un-
dergo the kind of changes
that would produce ele-
ment number 93.

In 1940 the American
physicists Edwin Mattison
McMillan (b. 1907) and
Philip Hauge Abelson (b.
1913), studying uranium
that had been bombarded
with neutrons, detected a
beta particle with a hall-
life of 2.3 days. When they

had tracked this down, they

announced on June 8, 1940,

that they had located traces
of element number 93.
Since uranium had
been named for the planet
Uranus (see 1789), the new
element, lying bevond ura-
nium, was named neptu-
niwm, for Neptune, the
planet lying beyond Uranus.
Since the neptunium
isotope that had been lo-
cated emitted beta parti-
cles, it had to gain another
unit in atomic number and
produce element number
