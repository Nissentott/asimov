Calculus

In the years 1665—1666,
Newton (see 1666) was stay-
ing at his mother’s farm in
order to escape the London
plague. One evening he saw
an apple fall from a tree at
a time when the Moon was
shining peacefully over-
head and began to wonder
why the Moon didn't fall.
He then thought that per-
haps it did, but that it was
also moving horizontally
and fell at each moment
just enough to make up for
the curvature of the Earth.
Thus, the Moon fell forever
but only succeeded in mov-
ing around the Earth in one
of Kepler’s ellipses.
Newton spent consider-
able time trying to work
out how Earth might pull
at the Moon as it pulled at
the apple, and at what rate
the Moon might be falling,
but he was not satisfied
with his calculations and
put them to one side. Some
say it was because there
was no good determination
of the exact size of the
Earth at the time; others
say it was because he didn't
know how to allow for the
fact that every bit of Earth
was pulling at the Moon
from slightly different dis-

tances and angles. He
needed a mathematical tool
that would help him solve
that problem.

In 1669 he began work-
ing on such a tool, a mathe-
matical technique that
came to be called calculus.
This was a more versatile
technique than anything in-
vented earlier, and science
could not do without it
these days. Calculus is the
beginning of higher mathe-
matics.

Working on the calcu-
lus at roughly the same
time as Newton was a Ger-
man mathematician, Gott-
fried Wilhelm Leibniz
(1646—1716). Both he and
Newton worked out the
technique—Newton, per-
haps, a little sooner—but
Leibniz ended with a better
symbolism.

This is not unusual.
Frequently two scientists
working independently
come up with the same an-
swers in response to the
same problems. Often the
solution is to give them
joint credit. Sometimes,
however, there are argu-
ments about which scien-
tist was really first, and
this may even degenerate
into accusations of plagia-
rism.

That is what happened
this time. Exacerbated by
national prejudices, En-
glish versus German, there
was a Homeric battle that
poisoned the scientific com-
munity for years without
ever settling anything.
Today, Newton and Leibniz
are given joint credit for
the caleulus.

Phosphorus

Of the substances chemists
now consider to be ele-
ments, nine were known to
the ancients. These in-
cluded seven metals: gold,
silver, copper, tin, iron,
lead, and mercury; and two
nonmetals: carbon and sul-
fur. Four more elements
were probably known and
were unmistakably de-
scribed by the medieval al-
chemists: arsenic,
antimony, bismuth, and
zinc. We do not know who
first discovered any of these
elements, or when.

The situation changed
when the German chemist
Hennig Brand (d. ca. 1692)
began searching for some-
thing that would enable
him to create gold. For
some reason, he thought he
would find it in urine. He
did not succeed in making
