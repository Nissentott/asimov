use a straight-edge (some-
thing that would draw
straight lines) and a com-
pass (something that would
draw circles) and you had
to do it in a finite number
of steps. Unfortunately,
they could never solve that
problem.

In working with it,
though, they got involved

with the ratio of the circum-

ference of a circle to its di-
ameter, a ratio that we now
refer to as pi (one of the
Greek letters). Anyone can
measure the diameter and
then run a piece of string

around the circumference,
straighten it, and measure
that, too. It turns out that
the circumference (for any
circle at all) is just a little
over 3 times as long as the
diameter. But what is the
ratio exactly?

There are geometric
ways of trying to get the
exact ratio, and Archi-

Medieval
Alchemy

The medieval alchemists
didn’t achieve much of
what they would have liked
to achieve. They didn't
manufacture gold out of
lead, and they didn’t find
the elixir of life. However,

 

they weren't totally useless,

either.

In 1597 a German al-
chemist, Andreas L
1540-1616), better known
by the Latinized form of his
name as Libavius, wrote a
book entitled Alchemnia in
which he summarized me

 

dieval achievements in al-
chemy. It was the first

chemical textbook worthy
of the name. Libavius

wrote clearly rather than

 

miystically. He was
