of God, but Darwin himself
had raised the possibility—
and that possibility has con-
cerned science ever since.

Organic
Synthesis

When Waéhler had synthe-
sized urea (see 1828), it
might very well have been
considered an anomaly, but
the techniques of organic
chemistry were advancing,
and other organic mole-
cules were being synthe-
sized from the elements.

In particular, Pierre-
Eugeéne-Marcelin Berthelot
(1827—-1907), a French
chemist, went about such
syntheses and, by 1860, had
synthesized such well-
known and important or-
ganic molecules as methyl
alcohol, ethyl alcohol,
methane, benzene, and
acetylene. He even synthe-
sized molecules that ful-
filled all the requirements
of organic molecules in
terms of structure and prop-
erties but that did not
oceur in living tissue,
which put an end once and
for all to the idea that only
living tissue could manufac-
ture organic molecules.

Indeed, in 1861, when
Kekule (see 1858) published
a textbook of organic chem-
istry, he defined it as the
chemistry of carbon com-

pounds, with no mention of
life. After that, when a term
was needed for the chemis-
try of compounds that
occur in living tissue spe-
cifically, the term chosen
was biochemistry (with bio-
from the Greek word for
“life”).

Internal-
Combustion
Engine

For a century and a half,
steam engines had pro-
duced heat outside the sys-
tem they were powering.
Steam formed by the heat
entered a cylinder and
moved a piston.

What if a mixture of in-
flammable vapor with air
could be exploded within a
cylinder? The force of this
internal explosion would
then move the piston di-
rectly. (The fuel would have
to be a gas to begin with, or
an easily evaporated lig-
uid.)

If such an internal-
combustion engine were
developed, it would be
much smaller than a steam
engine and so much more
readily set into motion.
After all, a vapor-air mix-
ture will explode at the
touch of a spark, while the
initial boiling of water over
a fire, in the case of the ex-
ternal-combustion steam
engine, is a slow process.

A working internal-
combustion engine was
first constructed by a
Belgian-born, French inven-
tor, Jean-Joseph-Etienne
Lenoir (1822—-1900). In
1860 he hitched such an en-
gine to a small conveyance
and had a “horseless car-
riage.” Horseless carriages
run by steam had existed
previously, but Lenoir’s
was more compact and
more responsive to con-
trols.

Nevertheless, Lenoir's
internal-combustion engine
was very inefficient. It was
not till the next decade that
an engine of this sort was
built that was efficient
enough for widespread use.

Solar
Prominences

Photography of astronomi-
cal phenomena was becom-
ing more common. In 1858
the English astronomer
Warren De la Rue (1815—
1889) had devised a tele-
scope that was particularly
adapted to taking photo-
graphs of the Sun. After
that, solar photography be-
came an almost daily rou-
tine for him.

In 1860 he traveled to
Spain to observe a total
eclipse of the Sun. The pho-
tograph he took of the Sun
during the eclipse showed
gouts of flame about its
