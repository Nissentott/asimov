Although China had by now
been civilized for some two
thousand years at least,
and though its technology
and science were remark-
able—in some ways they
continued to be in advance
of the West until the begin-
ning of modern times—I
have little to say about it
There are two reasons for
this.

First, in 221 B.C. a new
dynasty began to rule over
China, the Ch'in, the first
emperor of that dynasty
being Shih Huang Ti (259
210 B.c.). Shih Huang Ti
was a reforming emperor
who wanted to make a new
start and therefore had all
books burned (except for
those in the practical arts)

to free the land from the
stultifying hand of the past
And indeed, the land took
its name, China, from this
dynasty. History before
Shih Huang Ti is most un-
certain because of the de
struction.

Secondly, we can only
Jjudge scientific advance by
its effect on the world of
today. Some discovery that
was made a long time ago
but came to nothing must

nored. Dis-

 

be more or less i
coveries and inventions can
only count when they affect

y. As it happens, the

 

s0cie
modern world was carved
out by Europe when
gaged in the Age of |
tion in the fifteenth a
sixteenth centuries, in the

Scientific Revolution in the

sixteenth and seventeenth

 

centuries, and in the Indus-
trial Revolution in the eigh-
teenth and nineteenth

centuries. History naturally
must concern itself with all
["\

all aspects, but in this

 

ople and all cultures in

book, I concern myself with
scientific advances that al-
fect our life today, and for
that reason consider what
ever happened prior to the
contemporary era only inso
far as it affected Europe
This is not provincialism

on my part but a decisi

has developed
