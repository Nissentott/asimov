the core. Whereas under op-
tical observation, the Uni-
verse seemed to be serene
and peaceful (except for the
occasional novas and super-
novas), radio astronomy
began to show that it was

a surprisingly violent

place.

Birth of Stars

The more massive a star,
the brighter it is, the more
rapidly it consumes its nu-
clear fuel, and the shorter
its life on the main se-
quence (see 1914). The Sun
came into being as a star
only 4.5 billion years ago,
some 10 billion years after
the Universe itself came
into being, and will remain
on the main sequence only
5 or 6 billion years more.

Stars that are much
more massive than the Sun
can have lifetimes on the
main sequence of less than
a billion years, perhaps
even only several million.
Such stars that are still on
the main sequence now
must have been formed less
than a billion years ago, or
perhaps only a few million
years ago. This leads to the
thought that there may
well be interstellar clouds
out of which stars are form-
ing right now.

For instance, there are
reasons for thinking that
the Orion nebula is an ac-
tive star-former right now.

In 1955 the American as-
tronomer George Howard
Herbig (b. 1920) detected
two stars in the Orion neb-
ula that had not been seen
a few years earlier. This
means we may have wit-
nessed the actual birth of
these stars.

Jupiter's Radio
Waves

Radio waves are not only
emitted by stars and galax-
ies. In 1955 the American
astronomer Kenneth Linn
Franklin (b. 1923) detected
radio waves emanating
from the planet Jupiter.
They were nonthermal;
that is, they were not of the
pattern that would be emit-
ted simply because of the
temperature of Jupiter’s
cloud layer. Speculation
arose that they were the re-
sult of charged particles in
motion in the neighbor-
hood of Jupiter, and eventu-
ally this was found to be
true.

Pluto’s Rotation

Little could be observed of
Pluto because of its enor-
mous distance from us, but
in 1955 its light was seen to
fluctuate slightly, with a pe-
riod of 6.4 days. The obvi-
ous conclusion was that
Pluto rotated on its axis
once every 6.4 days and

that one hemisphere re-
flected somewhat less light
than the other.

Antiproton

In the twenty-six years
since Dirac had advanced
his theory of antiparticles
(see 1930), only the antielec-
tron (positron) had been de-
tected. Scientists were
quite convinced that if the
antielectron existed, the an-
tiproton had to exist also.
The antiproton, however,
would have a mass 1837
times that of the antielec-
tron and therefore require
1837 times the energy to be
formed.

It was not practical to
wait for one of the rela-
tively few cosmic ray parti-
cles sufficiently energetic to
form an antiproton. Once
the bevatron was built,
however (see 1954), ener-
gies capable of forming an-
tiprotons were available in
quantity.

In 1955 Segre, who had
first detected technetium
(see 1937), and the Amer-
ican physicist Owen
Chamberlain (b. 1920)
bombarded copper for
hours with protons pos-
sessing energies of 6.2 BeV.
They worked out an elabo-
rate system for detecting
any antiprotons that might
be formed, even amid large
numbers of other particles
of different charge and
