Supernova

A supernova, like the one
that had appeared in 1054,
blazed out in the constella-
tion of Cassiopeia, high in
the northern sky, in Novem-
ber 1572. The supernova of
1054 had gone unobserved
in Europe, but times had
changed.

A young Danish astron-
omer, Tycho Brahe (1546â€”
1601), usually known by his
first name, watched the
new star carefully from
night to night. When he
first saw it, it was brighter
than Venus, but it gradu-
ally faded until in March
1574, it could no longer be
seen at all. Tycho had
watched it for 485 days.

 

The Greeks had as-
sumed that the heavens (un-
like Earth) were perfect
and unchanging. Anythin
in the sky that seemed to
change (or to move in any
thing but a regular and pre-
dictable path) could not be
part of the sky, they
thought, but must be
of the atmosphere of the im-
perfect Earth. This in-
cluded clouds, shooting
stars, and comets.

The new star, being a
temporary phenomenon,
ought to be part of the at-
mosphere, 00, but al-
though Tycho tried to
determine its parallax (see
150 B.c.), he could detect
none. The new star must be
beyond the Moon and there
