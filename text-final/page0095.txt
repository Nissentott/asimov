Mirrors

Until now, glass had almost
always been colored (see
100 B.c.). It was in Venice
that the technique for add-
ing decolorizing material to
glass was developed and
where glass was first
formed that was reasonably
clear and transparer
Though uncolored glass
might seem boring, it
turned out not to be so.
Clear glass struck people as
beautiful, and to have cups
and other objects made of
it proved very desirable

In 1291 Venice re-

 

   

moved its glass-manufac-
turing establishment to a
guarded island and set up
stiff penalties for anyone re-
vealing any manufacturing
secrets. It did its best to
maintain a strict monopoly
of the valuable mater
and Venetian glass contin-
ued to be considered the
height of luxury.

One thing that cleat
glass made possible was
the modern mirror. In an-
cient times, people could
see themselves in still
water or in the polished sur

al,

 

 

face of a metal such as
bronze. Water rarely re-

mained still for long, how-
ever, and polished met

 

was expensive. The result
was that very few pec
knew what they locke
or could do something as

  

iple as arrange their

own hair

A sheet of clear glass
however, could be backed
with a film of metal, and

the result was a luminously

 

clear mirror in which it
was possible to study one’s

own face to one’s heart's

 

content. (It is not for n
ing that a mirror is alsc

called a looking-glass.)
