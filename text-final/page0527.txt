 

the American psychologist
John Broadus Watson
(1878-1958) developed the
thesis that human behavior
was explainable in terms of
conditioned responses, such
as those Pavlov had demon-

strated (see 1907). Watson
relegated even heredity to a
minor role.

Animals, including the
human being, he viewed as
intensely complicated ma-
chines, which reacted ac-

cording to their nerve-path
wiring, those nerve paths
being altered, or condi-
tioned, by experience. This
view of Watson's was called
behaviorism.
