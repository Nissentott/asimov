440 B.C.

 

Atoms

The Greek philosopher Leu-
cippus (5th century B.C.)
was the first to state cate-
gorically that every event
has a natural cause. This
rules out all intervention
by the supernatural and
represents the scientific
view held today.
Leucippus'’s student
Democritus (ca. 460—ca.

370 B.c.) adopted and ex-

tended Leucippus’s notions.

He maintained, from about
440 B.C., as Leucippus had
earlier, that all matier was
composed of tiny particles
so small that nothing
smaller was conceivable,
Hence they were in-
divisible, and he called
them atoms from a Greek
word meaning “indivisi-
ble.”

Of course Leucippus
and Democritus had no evi-
dence for their atomistic
views. They were only spec-
ulations, and most other
philosophers of the time ve-
hemently rejected them. It
was to be two thousand
years before atomistic
views began to gain ascen-
dancy.
