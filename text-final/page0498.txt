num oxide was long
enough, the substances in
the mixture would be com-
pletely separated by the
bottom of the column, and
they would be washed out
individually. The separa-
tion could be judged by the
appearance of different
shades of color on the col-
umpn, so the technique was
called chromatography,
from Greek words meaning
“writing in color.” The
name was retained even in
the case of mixtures of col-
orless substances.
Chromatography, mod-
ified in many ways, became
one of the most important
techniques for the study of
complex mixtures.

 

Radioactivity
and Earth

In 1906 the American geolo-
gist Clarence Edward Dut-
ton (1841-1912) suggested
that pockets of radioactiv-
ity in the Earth's crust de-
livered enough heat over
time to activate volcanic ac-
tion.

This was the beginning
of the understanding that
radioactivity added sub-
stantial heat to the Earth’s
crust, enough to balance
that lost by radiation, so
that any attempt to judge
the Earth’s age by calculat-
ing the time it took Earth
to “cool down” from an ini-

tial high temperature was
far off base. Earth could be
billions of years old and
still retain a heated inte-
rior.

Dutton also developed
methods for determining
the depth of earthquake ori-
gins and the velocity with
which earthquake waves
traveled through the Earth.
This opened the way for a
technique that finally of-
fered strong evidence con-
cerning the physical and
chemical nature of the
Earth’s deep interior.

Once it was understood
that radioactivity involved
the change of uranium or
thorium to some other ra-

dioactive atom, which then
broke down into still an-
other, and so on (see 1900,
Atomic Change, and 1902,
Radioactive Series), the
question that naturally
arose was, Where did it all
end?

The American chemist
Bertram Borden Boltwood
(1870-1927) was convinced
that lead was the final prod-
uct of the radioactive series
that began with uranium
and thorium. As early as
1905 he had noted that lead
