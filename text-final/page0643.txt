laboratory. This meant the
bacteria could be studied
easily and methods for
slowing or stopping

their growth could be
developed.

Viruses, however, grow
only within living cells, and
working with organisms is
much slower and less cer-
tain than working with
Petri dishes. For this rea-
son, viral diseases were far
more difficult to fight than
bacterial diseases.

Of course one needn't
grow the viruses in adult or-
ganisms. They could be
grown in the developing
embryos in chicken eggs, or
in those same embryo cells
mixed with blood. The trou-
ble was that although vi-
ruses would grow there, so
would bacteria, and the
bacteria would mask the vi-
ruses.

Once penicillin became
available, however, it could
be added to the chicken em-
bryo broth. This prevented
the growth of bacteria but
did not affect the viruses.
The American microbiolo-
gist John Franklin Enders
(1897-1985) developed this
technique in 1948, and it be-

  

came useful in searching
for ways to fight viral dis-
eases, notably poliomyelitis
(infantile paralysis).

For this work, Enders,
along with his colleagues
Thomas Huckle Weller (b.
1915) and Frederick Chap-
man Robbins (b. 1916),
shared the Nobel Prize for
medicine and physiology in
1954.

Starch
Chromatography

Chromatography of one
sort or another had been in
use since Tsvett’s discovery
of the technique (see 1906).
In 1948 the American bio-
chemists Stanford Moore
(1913-1982) and William
Howard Stein (1911-1980)
refined the method by
using starch as an absorp-
tive medium. In this way
they improved the manner
in which amino acids and
peptides could be sepa-
rated, and the two shared
the Nobel Prize for chemis-
try in 1972.

 

Bathyscaphe

Beebe explored the deeper
layers of the ocean with his
bathysphere (see 1934). The
bathysphere, however, was
a purely passive device sus-
pended from a ship by a life-
line. It could not move o1
maneuver independently.

What was needed was
a vessel that could move
about in the ocean at any
depth. Such a device was in-
vented by the Swiss physi-
cist Auguste Piccard, who
had already explored the
stratosphere by balloon
(see 1931).

He called the new de-
vice a bathyscaphe (ship of
the deep). It used a heavy
ballast of iron pellets to
take it down and a “bal-
loon” containing gasoline
to give it buoyancy. It jetti-
soned the iron pellets to
rise.

In 1948 the bathy-
scaphe descended, with a
man on board for the first
time, to a depth of 4,500
feet. Over the next fifteen
years, bathyscaphes pene-
trated the depths of the
life at even
the lowest levels
