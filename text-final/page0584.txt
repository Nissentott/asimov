and eight neutrons, the oxy-
gen-17 nucleus eight pro-
tons and nine neutrons, and
the oxygen-18 nucleus eight
protons and ten neutrons.
In the case of hydrogen, the
hydrogen-1 nucleus must
contain a proton only, with
the hydrogen-2 nucleus con-
taining one proton and one
neutron.

This new view of the
nucleus solved the spin
problem but introduced a
new problem of its own. If
the tiny nucleus were filled
with protons, all of which
were positively charged,
there must be an intense re-
pulsion among them. The
neutrons, being uncharged,
would do nothing te reduce
the repulsion. How then ac-
count for the fact that the
nucleus clings together
strongly? (As long as it was
thought that electrons
existed in the nucleus,
they might be viewed
as a kind of cement, but
that possibility was now
gone.)

Heisenberg suggested
that exchange forces might
exist. In other words, the
proton and neutron might
exchange particles in such
a way that a strong at-
traction would be pro-
duced, since the particles
could not be exchanged un-
less the proton and neutron
remained very close to-

gether. It took a few years
for this notion to be prop-
erly developed.

Positron

Dirac had predicted, from
theoretical considerations,
that there must be a parti-
cle just like the electron but
with a positive charge
rather than a negative one
(see 1930). However, such
an antielectron had not
been observed in nature.

The American physicist
Carl David Anderson (b.
1905) was working with
Millikan (see 1911) on cos-
mic rays. To carry out his
studies, he had devised a
cloud chamber (see 1911)
with a lead partition run-
ning across it. A cosmic ray
particle entering an ordi-
nary cloud chamber was so
energetic that a magnetic
field scarcely managed to
deflect it at all, and from
the virtually straight-line
trace that resulted, not
much information about it
could be derived. If a lead
partition was placed in the
chamber, the cosmic ray
particle had energy enough
to smash through it but lost
enough energy in the pro-
cess to allow it to be easily
deflected on the far side of
the partition.

In 1932, while con-
ducting research with his
lead-partitioned cloud

chambers, Anderson noted
tracks emerging from the
lead that were clearly elec-
tron tracks (experienced re-
searchers could read tracks
at a glance). The only pecu-
liarity was that the electron
tracks curved in the wrong
direction. Anderson had
found the positively
charged particle that Dirac
had predictedâ€”the anti-
electron. Anderson, how-
ever, thought of it as a
positive electron and gave it
the shortened name of posi-
tron, which it has carried
ever since.

For his discovery, An-
derson was awarded the
Nobel Prize for physics in
1936, sharing it with Hess,
who had discovered cosmic
rays (see 1911).

Particle
Accelerator and
Nuclear
Reaction

The first human-made nu-
clear reaction had been car-
ried through by Rutherford
(see 1919). For the purpose,
he had used alpha particles
produced naturally by ra-
dioactive sources. Other nu-
clear reactions brought
about since then had also
made use of such alpha par-
ticles.
