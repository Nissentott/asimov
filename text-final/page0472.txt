1899

Actinium

There was more in uranium
ores than the polonium and
radium that the Curies had
detected (see 1898). In 1899
the French chemist André-
Louis Debierne (1874—
1949), a close [riend of the
Curies, isolated still an-
other element from the
ores. He called it actinium,
from a Greek word for
“ray,” so that the name
was the Greek equivalent of
the Latin radium.

 

Logic and
Geometry

In 1899 the German mathe-
matician David Hilbert
(1862—-1943) published

Foundations of Geometry, in
which he proposed a set of
axioms for geometry that
was the most satisfactory
vet, He began with points,
lines, and planes as unde-
fined concepts. It was not
necessary to define them,
merely to describe certain
properties they possessed.
He also used certain rela-
tionships, such as between,
parallel, and continuous,
without defining them.
Again, provided the conse-
quences of using those
words were clearly set
forth, it didn’t matter what
they actually meant. Hil-
bert proved his system of
axioms to be self-consis-
tent, and that was crucial.

Solid Hydrogen

Dewar, who had liquefied
hydrogen the year before,
took another step toward
absolute zero by producing
solid hydrogen in 1899.
This brought the lowest
temperature ever obtained
down to 14° K. At this tem-
perature, all known sub-
stances but one were solid.
The only exception was he-
lium, which even at this
temperature remained gas-
eous.
