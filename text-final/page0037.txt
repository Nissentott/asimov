Iron

Iron is the second most
common metal in the
Earth's crust (only alumi-
num is more common), but
it always occurs in combi-
nation with other sub-
stances. It is not found in
free metallic form except in
some meteorites, which are
not of Earth but fall from
the sky.

Such meteorites were
occasionally found by the
ancients and used even in
the earliest days of civiliza-
tion. Compared to gold, sil-
ver, and copper, iron is an
ugly metal, but the mete-
oric iron that was found re-
vealed itself to be harder
and tougher even than
bronze. Since it held its
edge far better than bronze
did, it was much in de-
mand for edged portions of
tools.

The result is that no
iron meteorite from the

past is ever found where
the earliest civilizations
lourished. The ancients
scavenged them all.

Yet ores did not yield
iron. Gold, silver, copper,
lead, tin, and eventually
mercury were obtained
with ease by use of wood
fires, but such fires never
yielded iron. Iron held on to
other substances more
tightly than the other met-
als did, and a higher tem-
perature was needed.

Eventually, though
charcoal was obtained by
burning wood with an in-
sufficient supply of air so
that more-or-less pure car
bon was left behind when
other substances burned
away. Charcoal burns
flamelessly but reaches
higher temperatures than
wood does.

About 1500 B.c. the Hit
tites of Asia Minor found
they could obtain iron [rom
certain ores by heating

 

those ores with burning
charcoal. Iron was at first a
disappointment. In pure

form, it is tough but n

  

 

hard as the best bronze
(Meteoric iron is nol pure
iron but is a 9-to-1 mixture
of iron and nickel, some-
thing the ancients
duplicate since they knew
nothing of nickel.)
