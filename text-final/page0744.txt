liquid helium, would surely
give off hydrogen gas and
create the danger of explo-
sion.

Liquid nitrogen is
much cheaper and easier to
prepare and use than either
liquid helium or liquid hy-
drogen. It is also quite safe
to use. Unfortunately, it ex-
ists only at temperatures
higher than 77° K, and that
seemed hopelessly high.

In February 1987, how-
ever, a Swiss physicist,
Karl Alex Mueller (b. 1927),
and a German colleague,

   

Johannes Georg Bednorz
(b. 1950), studying ceramic
substances (mixtures of me-
tallic oxides) rather than
metals, found they were ob-
taining superconductivity
at temperatures of 30° K.
This broke with shat-
tering impact on the scien-
tific community. Everyone
began studying ceramics,
and superconductivity in
the liquid nitrogen temper-
ature range was obtained.
The difficulties that re-
main are that no good theo-
retical explanation of this

 

 

astonishing behavior of ce-
ramics exists, so that it is
still a matter of “cookbook
chemistry,” as properties
vary erratically from one
ceramic to another and
from one batch of a particu-
lar ceramic to another.
Then too, ceramics are not
easy to form into film or
wire, so that much must be
done before technological
applications can be made.
Nevertheless, Mueller
and Bednorz, without
delay, shared the Nobel
Prize for physics in 1987

Distant Galaxies

New instruments and com-
puterized techniques made
it possible to detect galax-
ies with red shifts (see
1925) greater than any pre-
viously seen; greate
than those of quas

important with respect to
the birth of the Universe. If
the galaxies were seventeen
billion light-years away, it
had taken their light seven-
teen billion years to reach
us, and we were seeing
them as they existed seven-
teen billion years ago. This
meant that even seventeen
billion years ago the Uni-
verse was old enough to
have formed galaxies.

 

The age of the Universe
has not been determined
precisely. It depends on
knowledge concerning the
distance of galaxies and the
rate at which the Universe
is expanding. These are un-
certain quantities. The age
of the Universe has been set
at somewhere between ten
and twenty billion years,
with fifteen billion as the
most probable.
