discovered by the American
chemist Thomas Midgley,
Jr. (see 1921). In 1930 he
prepared difluoredichlo-
romethane, with a mole-
cule consisting of a carbon
atom to which two chlorine
atoms and two fluorine
atoms were attached. It
had all the properties
needed for refrigeration.

It belonged to the class
of chlorofluorocarbons, and
other molecules of the class
had uses too. For example,
such liquids could be used
in spray cans to force other
liquids out in a fine mist.

Trademarked prepara-
tions of the liquid, like
Freon, rapidly went into
use. They made air-condi-

tioners common and, in-
deed, in developed
societies, nearly universal
equipment. Eventually

 

however, the chlorofluoro-
carbons were found to have
dangers that at the time of
their discovery could not
have been foreseen, and
their use is now being in-
creasingly discouraged.

Godel’s Proof

Thirty years earlier, Frege
had attempted to place all
of mathematics on a formal
logical basis, making it
fully rigorous, and had
failed (see 1902). Other,
more elaborate attempts
followed.

An Austrian mathema-
tician, Kurt Godel (1906—
1978), put a final end to

such schemes in 1931 by ad-
vancing what is now called
Gadel's proof. He translated
the symbols of symbolic
logic into numbers in a sys-
tematic way and showed
that it was always possible
to construct a number that
could not be arrived at
from the other numbers of
his system.

What it amounted to
was this; Godel showed

that if you began with any
set of axioms, there would
always be statements
within the system governed
by those axioms that could
be neither proved nor dis-
proved on the basis of those
axioms. If the axioms were
modified in such a way that
the statement could be ei-
ther proved or disproved,
then another statement
could be constructed that
