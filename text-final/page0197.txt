Calculating
Machines

Leibniz (see 1669, Calculus)
devised a calculating ma-
chine in 1693 that went be-
yond Pascal’s (see 164
Whereas Pascal’s could
only add and subtract, Leib-
niz's could multiply by au-
tomatically repeating
addition, and divide by au-
tomatically repeating sub-
traction. Leibniz also
invented a mechanical aid
to the calculation of trigo-
nometric and astronomical
tables.

This showed much
more clearly than Pascal’s
evice did that arithmeti-
| manipulations followed
simple rules and repeti-
s and by no means re-
quired the cr
imagination or reasoning
power of the human brain.

Mortality Tables

Death was death and
human beings had to learn
to accept it stoically. It did
