from its resting place near
Norfolk, Virginia, renamed
the ship Virginia, covered
her with iron plates, placed
a cast-iron ram under the
waterline, and outfitted her
with ten guns.

On March 8, the iron-
clad Merrimack attacked
the wooden Union ships
that were blockading the
port and sank them. She
was absolutely untouchable
by the Union guns. For a
while it seemed as though
the Merrimack could single-
handedly take on and de-
stroy the entire Union navy
and break the blockade.
The Confederacy could
then, with British help, win
its independence.

However, an American
engineer of Swedish birth,
John Ericsson (1803—1889),
had already built an iron-
clad vessel, the Monitor, for
the Union, It was small,
floated very low in the
water, and had two guns, It
sailed south just as the Mer-
rimack was launching its at-
tack. On March 9, only one
day after the Merrimack's,
triumph, the Monitor ar-
rived, and there was a 5-

hour fight in which neither
ship could damage the
other. However, the Merri-
mack sprang a leak, moved
into dry dock, and never
left again, so the Union was
saved.

It was clear to the
whole world, however, that
wooden warships were now
obsolete, and every navy
(including especially the
British) began the process
of converting itself into an
ironclad force.

Machine Guns

The Colt revolver, which
had come into use two de-
cades before, was not the
last word, of course. Re-
peating rifles, called car-
bines, had come into use in
1860. More destructiveness
was wanted, though—an in-
definite stream of bullets.
The American inventor
Richard Jordan Gatling
(1818-1903) sought to de-
vise a gun that could fire
bullets out of a chain of car-
tridges and that wouldn’t
stop until the chain ran
out. By November 1862 he
had developed a rapid-fire

gun that could shoot nearly
six bullets per second,
though it had to be hand-
cranked.

This Gatling gun was
the first machine gun and it
was used by the Union
forces toward the end of the
Civil War. Gatling's name
lives today in the slang
term gat, used for any hand-
gun.

Hemoglobin

One of the most familiar
proteins is the one in red
blood corpuscles that com-
bines with oxygen in the
lungs and carries it to the
cells of the tissues, where it
gives it up again. One of
those who analyzed the pro-
tein carefully was the Ger-
man biochemist Felix
Hoppe-Seyler (1825-1895).
He crystallized it in 1862
and gave it its name of he-
moglobin (hemo- from the
Greek word for “blood”
and globin as a brief ver-
sion of globulin, which is
the class of proteins to
which it belongs). When it
combines with oxygen, it
becomes oxyhemoglobin.
