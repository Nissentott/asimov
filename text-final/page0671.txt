American biochemist Ar-
thur Kornberg (b. 1918),
who had been a student of
Ochoa'’s, obtained another
such enzyme from the bac-
terium Escherichia coli. It
could catalyze the forma-
tion of DNA-like substances
from individual nucleo-
tides.

Now enzymes could be
used to form nucleic acid

chains made up of one, two,

or three different nucleo-
tides.

As a result, Ochoa and
Kornberg received the
Nobel Prize for medicine
and physiology in 1959.

Cyanocobalamin
Structure

The British physicist Doro-
thy owfoot Hodg
kin (b. 1910) was interested
in the structure of complex
molecules in livir

purpose, she used X-ray dif-
fraction photographs and

This was the first direct use
of a computer in solving a
biochemical problem,

  
       

okin then went on
to tackle the structure of cy-
anocobalamin (vitamin B-
12). Its molecule was four
times as massive as that of
penicillin. Again Hodgkin
made use of X-ray diffrac-
tion and a computer, but
even so, the molecule was

 

   
  
 

   

  

 

so complex that working
out its structure took ye

Nevertheless, by 1955
Hodgkin had completed the
job, and as a result was
awarded the Nobel Prize
for chemistry in 1964.
