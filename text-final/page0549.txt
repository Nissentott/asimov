A British archaeologi-
cal expedition under
George Edward Stanhope
Molyneux Herbert, Earl of
Carnarvon (1866—1923),
and Howard Carter (1873—
1939) found the first sign of
the entrance to Tutankha-
men’s tomb on November
4, 1922. Three days later
they reached the sealed
burial chamber, and a rich
treasure trove of ancient
Egyptian artifacts was un-
covered. It gave tremen-
dous impetus to Egyptian
studies.

It also gave rise to the
silly tale of the “Pharaoh’s
curse,” when Lord Carnar-
von died five months later
of an infected mosquito
bite complicated by pneu-
monia, but surely no sane
man could believe Tutank-
hamen had anything to do
with it. Carter lived on for
seventeen years after open-
ing the tomb.

Vitamin E

Nutritionists were carefully
placing rats, guinea pigs,
and other animals on lim-
ited diets in order to find
disorders that could be
eliminated by the addition
of particular foods to that
diet. When diet could cor-
rect one disorder without
having much effect on
other disorders known to
be caused by lack of a vita-
min, the presence of a new
vitamin could be suspected.

In 1922 the American
anatomist Herbert McLean
Evans (1882—-1971), who
four years earlier had deter-
mined that human cells
contained twenty-four pairs
of chromosomes (actually
twenty-three, it was later
shown), found a limited
diet that rendered rats ster-
ile and that could be cor-
rected by fresh lettuce,
wheat germ, or dried al-
falfa but not by already
known vitamins. As a re-
sult, it looked as if another
vitamin (later known as vi-
tamin E) existed, one that
was fat-soluble, as were vi-
tamins A and D.

Growth
Hormone

Evans, the discoverer of vi-
tamin E (see above), also
showed in 1922 that an ex-
tract of the pituitary gland
(which is attached to the
lower surface of the brain)
served to promote gigain-
tism in rats, making them
grow to a significantly
larger size than normal.
That indicated the presence
of a growth hormone in the
pituitary.

Lysozyme

In 1922 the Scottish bacteri-
ologist Alexander Fleming
(1881-1955) isolated an en-
zyme called lysozyme from
tears and mucus. He found

it to have bactericidal (bac-
teria-destroying) proper-
ties. [t was the first
example of a human en-
zyme that had such proper-
ties, and it represented the
as-yet pale dawn of a time
when more powerful natu-
ral products of this sort
would be found.

Origin of Life
Darwin, who had advanced
his theory of evolution six
decades earlier (see 1858),
had not taken up the mat-
ter of the origin of life. Not
enough was known, and the
subject was too touchy.

Spontaneous genera-
tion (life derived from non-
life) had been disproven by
Pasteur (see 1860), but only
under present conditions.
In earlier times, when life
first made its appearance,
the Earth’s environment
was radically different
from what it is today (there
was no oxygen in the atmo-
sphere, for instance), and
no life existed that might
promptly consume the ma-
terial that represented the
first tentative approaches
to life.

Even so, there was
some reluctance to consider
the matter of a naturalistic
origin to life, one that did
not require the intervention
of a Creator. The first per-
son to make a significant
study of the matter was a
Russian biochemist, Alex-
