Radio Waves
and Sound

Radio communication first
came into use only as a
wireless telegraph, forming
the dots and dashes of the
Morse code in appropriate
bursts of radio waves.

It occurred to the Cana-
dian-born American physi-
cist Reginald Aubrey
Fessenden (1866—1932) to
send out a continuous sig-
nal with an amplitude (the
height of the waves) vary-
ing in such a way as to fol-
low the irregularities of
sound waves. The radio
wave was said to have am-
plitude modulation (AM) im-
posed on it.

At the receiving end,
the modulation could be re-
converted into sound
waves, with the result that
you could use a radio for
speaking and hearing
thanks to modulated radio
waves the same way you
could use a telephone for
speaking and hearing
thanks to modulated elec-
tric currents.

On December 24, 1906,
the first such message was
sent out from the Massachu-
setts coast, and wireless re-
ceivers picked up music.

Triode

The rectifying diode
worked out by Fleming (see
1904) was a useful tool but
limited in its range. That
range was extended in 1906
by the American inventor
Lee De Forest (1873-1961).
He inserted a third ele-
ment, called a grid, into the
tube to make it a triode
(three electrodes).

The grid is an electrode
with holes in it, so that elec-
trons can move from the
hot filament through the
holes of the grid to the
plate. Even a weak charge
placed on the grid can have
a relatively enormous effect
on the electron current. It
can increase the intensity
of the current if the grid is
slightly positively charged,
since it then attracts elec-
trons from the heated fila-
ment; and it can decrease
the intensity if slightly neg-
atively charged, since it
then repels electrons. By
placing a small varying
charge on the grid, you get
a much larger variation in
the electron flow.

A triode therefore acts
as an amplifier, and it can
be modified to perform a
great variety of tasks.
Radio became more than

ever adapted to the trans-
mission of sound through
Fessenden's modulation
(see above).

Trojan
Asteroids

By 1906, no fewer than 587
asteroids had been spotted
(thanks to Wolf’s photo-
graphic technique—see
1891) and had their orbits
calculated.

In 1906 Wolf discov-
ered an asteroid that
moved unusually slowly
and must therefore be un-
usually distant. In fact it
moved in Jupiter’s orbit at
the outer extreme of the as-
teroid belt, keeping step
with Jupiter at a distance
of 60 degrees.

This meant that the
Sun, Jupiter, and the new
asteroid were located at the
vertices of a vast equilat-
eral triangle. Lagrange (see
1788) had shown back in
1772 that such an arrange-
ment was gravitationally
stable, but this was the first
case of such a gravitational
triangle that had been actu-
ally found in space.

Wolf named the aster-
oid Achilles, after the hero
of Homer’s Iliad, the tale of
