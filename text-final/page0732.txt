Jupiter’s
Satellites

The probes Voyager I and
Voyager 2 passed by Jupiter
in March and July, respec-
tively, of 1979. The most in-
teresting result was that
they gave humanity its first
close look at the four Gali-
lean satellites.

The satellites are sub-
ject to tidal heating from
Jupiter, a heating that in-
creases rapidly as distance
from Jupiter decreases.
Thus, Ganymede and
Callisto, the outermost
pair, are both covered
with craters as might be
expected and seem to be
made up largely of icy
material.

Europa, second-closest
to Jupiter, is not cratered
it has, in fact, the smooth-
est solid surface yet seen in
the Solar System—but
cracked and criss-crossed
with lines (rather like the
old maps of Mars that
showed the supposed ca-
nals). Apparently Europa is
covered with a worldwide
glacier that has liquid un-

 

derneath. Any cosmic colli-
sion that might ordinarily
cause a crater merely
cracks the glacier, and the
hole produced is then re-
paired by the formation of
additional ice.

lo, the closest of the
four satellites to Jupiter,
has no water at all, the heat-
ing having driven it off. In
fact, the inner heating pro-
duces active volcanoes,
which the probes photo-
graphed in actual eruption.
Sulfur dioxide exudes and
breaks up into sulfur and
oxygen. lo's surface is there-
fore covered by a yellow to
red layer of sulfur, which
fills in any but the most re-
cent of craters. The erup-
tions also account for the
thin gas that fills Io’s orbit,
forming a doughnut around
Jupiter.

In addition to all of
this, three more small satel-
lites were discovered, all of
them closer to Jupiter than
any that had been discov-
ered from Earth. This made
sixteen satellites all told for
Jupiter. Finally, very close
to Jupiter, a thin ring of de-
bris was found, so that Jupi-

ter joined Saturn and
Uranus in being a ringed
planet.

Extinction of the
Dinosaurs

In 1979 the American scien-
tist Walter Alvarez was try-
ing to establish
sedimentation rates in old
sedimentary rocks in Italy.
To do that, he made use of
neutron-activation tech-
niques that allowed him to
determine with great preci-
sion the quantities of vari-
ous rare elements present
in the rocks.

He found to his sur-
prise that a certain narrow
layer of the rock contained
some twenty-five times as
much of the rare metal irid-
ium as there was above and
below it. The narrow layer
that contained the iridium
was sixty-five million years
old and was therefore right
at the boundary where the
Mesozoic era yields to the
Cenozoic era. At that
boundary, dinosaurs and
many other species of
plants and animals had be-
