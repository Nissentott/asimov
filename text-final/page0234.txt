Venus’s
Atmosphere

Unlike the other planets,
Venus had no markings. It
always presented a feature-
less white orb. It remained
interesting, however, be-
cause periodically (being
closer to the Sun than
Earth is) it passed exactly
between Earth and Sun. On
such occasions, it appeared
as a small black sphere
moving across the face of
the Sun. This is called a
transit of Venus.

In 1761 there was a
transit of Venus coming
and astronomers organized
expeditions to Newfound-
land and to St. Helena to
observe it from widely sepa-
rated spots. If the exact
time at which Venus’s orb
first touched the Sun’s rim
and the exact time at which
it finally left on the other
side were determined from
those widely separated

spots, Venus's parallax
could be determined, and
its distance, together with
that of the Sun, might be
determined to a higher de-
gree of accuracy than was
produced by Cassini’s deter-
mination of the parallax of
Mars.

The expedition failed.
The time when Venus en-
tered and left the solar
sphere could not be deter-
mined accurately, to the
frustration of all.

One observer, the Rus-
sian scientist Mikhail Vasi-
lievich Lomenosov (1711—
1765), pointed out that this
could be due to Venus’s pos-
session of an atmosphere.
The atmosphere would fuzz
Venus's outline, so to
speak, and make the points
of contact difficult to time.
Furthermore, if the atmo-
sphere had a permanent
cloud layer, that would
help explain both Venus's
brilliance (since the cloud
layer would reflect most of

the sunlight striking it) and
its featurelessness.

Percussion

Methods for medical diag-
noses were not many in
these days. In 1761, how-
ever, an Austrian physician,
Leopold Auenbrugger von
Auenbrugg (1722-1809),
published a book entitled
Inventum novum (A New [n-
vention) in which he
pointed out that tapping
the body, especially the
chest area, and listening to
the sound produced would
give some indication of cer-
tain disorders of the inter-
nal organs. (He checked
this by comparing the
sounds he elicited with the
state of the organs as re-
vealed by postmortems.)

It took forty years, how-
ever, before this diagnostic
method became common in
medicine.
