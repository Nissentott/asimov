Black Hole
Evaporation

Black holes (see 1916), it
seemed, could only gain
matter, never lose matter.
If so, they were destined to
grow indefinitely and
would, in the end, consume
all the matter of the Uni-
verse.

In 1970, however, the
British physicist Stephen
William Hawking (b. 1942)
reasoned from quantum
mechanical considerations
that black holes might have
a temperature. Therefore, if
surrounded by an environ-
ment with a lower tempera-
ture, black holes would
evaporate. Massive black
holes with the mass of a
star or of many stars would
evaporate so slowly that
they would endure for
many, many times the pres-
ent age of the Universe. As
their mass decreased, how-
ever, their rate of evapora-
tion would increase.

The view was devel-
oped, then, that the final
status of the Universe
would not be a collection of
black holes but a thin ex-
panding mélange of leptons
and photons originating
from evaporated black
holes.

Meteoritic
Amino Acids

The Sri Lanka-born Ameri-
can biochemist Cyril Pon-
namperuma (b. 1923) was
continuing to attempt to
produce molecules of bio-
chemical interest from the
primordial constituents of
Earth's atmosphere, in the
line of experimentation
begun by Miller (see 1952).
This investigation into
life’s origins took an un-
usual turn in 1970 when
Ponnamperuma studied a
meteorite that had fallen in
Australia the year before. It
was of a rare kind called a
carbonaceous chondrite, a

fragile black material that
contained measurable
quantities of water and or-
ganic material. Ponnamper-
uma showed that five
different amino acids of the
kind that helped make up
protein molecules were
present in the meteorite.

These meteoritic amino
acids did not originate in
living tissue, for if they had
(judging from the amino
acids in living tissue on
Earth), they would all have
only one of two possible
structural arrangements
and would rotate the plane
of polarized light (be opti-
cally active). The amino
acids in the meteorite were
optically inactive, meaning
that they consisted of both
structures in equal
amounts, so that each can-
celed the optical activity of
the other. This was to be ex-
pected if they had been
formed by some process not
involving life.
