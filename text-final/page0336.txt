cided to remain there), he
found evidence of glacia-
tion in North America.

In the end he drew a
convincing picture of an Ice
Age, a period in the past
when millions of square
miles of North America,
Scandinavia, and Siberia
lay under a thick ice sheet.
This was the first intima-
tion that uniformitarianism
(see 1830) was not one long,
steady progression without
surprises. The coming and
going of the ice sheets had
to be a kind of catastrophe,
though clearly it had not
put an end to life.

Chlorophyll and
Cells

When chlorophyll had been
isolated (see 1817), its wide-
spread existence in plants
made it seem inevitable
that it had some important
function.

In 1837 the French
chemist René-Joachim-
Henri Dutrochet (1776—
1847) was able to show
definitely that photosynthe-
sis (see 1779) took place
only in those plant cells
that contained chlorophyll.
The key importance of chlo-
rophyll to all multicellular

 

life, animals as well as
plants, was thus definitely
established.

Dutrochet was a con-
vinced antivitalist, by the
way. He believed that all as-
pects of nature, animate
and inanimate, were sub-
ject to the same physical
and chemical laws.

Trisecting an
Angle

The Greeks had established
the principle that geometri-
cal constructions must be
carried through with only a
straightedge and a compass
(so that you could only
draw straight lines and cir-
cular arcs) and in a finite
number of steps. There was
no real reason for this ex-
cept that it gave geometers
the very minimum of tools
to work with and made
their tasks more “sport-
ing.”

There were three con-
structions, however, the
Greeks could never solve
with straightedge and com-
pass alone. The first was
squaring the circle; that is,
given a circle of any area,
construct a square of the
same area. The second was
doubling the cube; that is,
given a cube of any volume,

construct another cube of
twice the volume. The third
was trisecting the angle;
that is, given an angle of
any size, divide it into three
equal angles.

Since the Greeks, other
mathematicians had tack-
led those problems with
equal lack of success. The
work of Gauss (see 1796)
and Abel (see 1824), how-
ever, had shown the value
of proving impossibility in
mathematics. In 1837 a
French mathematician,
Pierre Wantsel (1814—
1848), proved that doubling
the cube and trisecting the
angle were indeed impossi-
ble by the Greek rules.
Eventually, squaring the
circle was also shown to be
impossible.

It is a queer commen-
tary on human nature that
these proofs of impossibil-
ity have not convinced any
number of eager amateurs.
A century and a half after
these problems were shown
to be impossible of solution
by the Greek rules, hordes
of circle-squarers and other
impossibility-defiers still
continue to offer the world
their solutions, Needless to
say, all such "“solutions,”
without exception, have—
and indeed must have—a
fallacy somewhere.
