1813

Chemical
Symbols

nce the notion of atoms
advanced, the qu

them. Simplicity
mended the use of letters,
and in 1813 Berzelius (see
1803) advanced
that was eventually

pted. Initial lett
used: H for a hydrogen
atom, C for a carbon ator
O for an gen atom, and
so on. If more than one ele-
ment had the same initi
a second letter from the
body of the name was used,

 

so that Ca was calcium, Cl
was chlorine, and Cr was
chromium. In the case ol

ent elements that had
different names in different
languages, the Latin name
was used in the symbol, so
that gold was Au (aurtm),
silver was Ag (argentum),
and so on.

Compounds were s

sting the atoms.

Since water molecules are
made up of two hydrogen
atoms and one ox)

atom, water is H,O. Ammo-
nia is NH,. Sulfuric acid is
H,S0;. And so on.

Plant
Classification

The French botanist Au-
gustin-Pyrame de Candolle
(1778-1841) began a la
encyclopedia of plant life in
1813, a project that out-
lasted him. Only seven of
the twenty-one volumes
had published by the
time of his death. His
tem of plant classificatio

as far more scientific than
that of Linnaeus and is still
used today. It was Candolle
who, in 1812, first used the
word taxonomy to represent
species classification.
