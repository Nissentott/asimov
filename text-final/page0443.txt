lated. It surged alternately,
first into one, then into the
other of two metal balls sep-
arated by an air gap. Each
time the potential reached
a peak in one direction or
the other, it sent a spark
across the gap.

In the course of these
experiments, Hertz noted
that when ultraviolet light
shone on the negative ter-
minal of the gap, the one
from which the spark is-
sued, the spark was more
easily elicited. This did not
seem to have anything to
do with what he was trying
to observe, so he noted the
matter but did not follow it
up.

This was the first obser-
vation of the effect of light
on electrical phenomena,
however. This photoelectric
effect turned out to be ex-
tremely important.

Mach Number

With advancing technol-
ogy, human beings were
traveling faster than they
had in the past, and they
were likely to travel faster
still in the future. The
faster human beings trav-

eled, the more important
air resistance would be,
The Austrian physicist
Ernst Mach (1838-1916)
studied the conditions that
occurred when a solid ob-
ject and air were in rapid
motion relative to each
other.

The natural rate at
which air molecules can
move is the speed of sound
through air. When an ob-
ject moves through air at
higher speeds, the air mole-
cules can no longer move
aside naturally but must be
shoved aside (so to speak)
faster than they want to
go. This produces new
conditions, which Mach
studied.

For instance, faster-
than-sound motion com-
presses air and sets up a
bunching of sound waves
that then expands to pro-
duce a sudden clap, Thun-
der is the best example of
such a sonic boom, with the
heat of lightning expanding
the air at greater than the
speed of sound. Another ex-
ample of a senic boom is
the crack of a bullwhip.

A speed equal to that of

sound is now called Mach 1

in Mach's honor. Twice
that speed is Mach 2, and
SO on

Rubber Tire

Since wheeled transporta-
tion had been invented five
thousand years before,
wheels had had wooden or
metal rims. These were
noisy and offered no spring,
so that travel on carts and
wagons was a jolting affair,

In 1887 a British inven-
tor, John Boyd Dunlop
(1840-1921), decided to
rim the wheels of his son's
tricycle with a rubber tire
(and patented the notion
the following year). Rub-
ber, though soft, actually
wears better than wood or
iron does. What's more,
Dunlop made it a pneu-
matic tire: what went
round the rim was an air-
filled tube, which was cov-
ered by a tire with a rubber
tread.

This gave a vehicle
spring and cut down the
noise tremendously, so that
tires were soon used for au-
tomobiles and other vehi-
cles as well.
