the domestication of goats
in the Middle East. The
goats would be cared for,
fed, and encouraged to re-
produce. They would sup-
ply milk, butter, and cheese
and, by dint of judicious
culling, meat. What’s more,

since goats eat grass and
other substances humans
find inedible, the food sup-
ply was increased at no
cost. (Dogs have to be given
food that would otherwise
fill human stomachs.)

Until then, people had

found their food by hunting
and gathering, with all the
insecurities attendant on
that. Herding provided a
much more secure food

supply.

 

8000 B.C.

Agriculture

Human beings led a no-
madic life. As long as hunt-
ing was a major source of
food, they had to be pre-
pared to follow migrating
herds of animals. Even if
they lived on plants and on
nonmigrating animals, a
tribe lingering in one place
too long would consume
the available food and have
to move elsewhere for fresh
foraging.

Even when human be-
ings became herders, they
remained nomads. The
herds had to be taken to
fresh pastures now and
then, either because of sea-
sonal changes or because of
overgrazing.

About 8000 B.c., how-
ever, in the same region
where animals were first
domesticated, something
new arrived, heralding a

 

change greater than any
since the first use of fire.

What it amounted to
was that plants were do-
mesticated. Somehow it oc-
curred to human beings to
plant seeds deliberately, to
wait for them to grow, to
water them, and to wait for
them to ripen while de-
stroying competing plants.
Then the plants could be
harvested and would serve
as food.

It was tedious and
back-breaking work, but
the net result was that a
great deal of food could be
obtained, far more than by
hunting and gathering, or
even herding, since plant
life is more copious than an-
imal life.

The coming of herding
and agriculture, particu-
larly agriculture, meant
that a given area of land
could support a larger pop-

ulation than before. There
was less starvation, more
children survived, and the
population increased.

Agriculture began in
northern Iraq where wheat
and barley grew wild, and
it was these that were do-
mesticated. The kernels of
grain could be ground into
flour that could be stored
for months on end without
spoiling and could be
baked into a tasty and nu-
tritious bread.

Despite the increase in
the food supply, farmers
must have been very con-
scious of their labor, a kind
of slavery foisted upon
them, which even the use of
animals didn’t much miti-
gate. The tale of the Garden
of Eden in the Bible may be
the product of farmers who
remembered with nostalgia
a kind of “golden age”
when human beings hunted
