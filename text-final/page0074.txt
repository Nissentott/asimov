The Middle Ages (476—1453)

Technological advances
continued to be made in
the Middle Ages. Yet the
light of pure scientific in-
quiry dimmed consider-
ably, especially during the
first five centuries of the pe-
riod, which are often re-
ferred to as a Dark Age.
This was an intensely theo-
logical age, marked by am-
bivalence about science
when its findings seemed to
go against religious teach-
ing. A later resurgence of in-
terest in theoretical science
was dampened by the
Black Death, a devastating
epidemic of bubonic
plague. In the early seventh
century, the center of scien-
tific activity shifted to the
East, as invading Muslims
took control of the Hellenis-
tic cities that were reposito-
ries of Greek learning. Arab
scholars eagerly absorbed
the knowledge in the old
texts, and they did impres-
sive new work in astron-
omy, optics, medicine, and
alchemy, the predecessor of
modern chemistry. Toward
the end of the Middle Ages,
the ancient learning that

the Arabs had collected and
expanded upon came back
to Europe. For most of the
Middle Ages, astronomy
was ignored in the West.
Several new stars were de-
tected by Chinese astrono-
mers, but no one in Europe
noticed them. Porcelain
and the production of silk
were imported from China;
other innovations that may
have been developed inde-
pendently in Europe al-
ready existed in China, The
Chinese apparently had
long known about the direc-
tion-finding properties of
magnetic ore but didn't use
it for navigation. When
Western navigators first did
so in 1180, they created in
the compass a tool that—
because of the subsequent
explorations and European
domination of other cul-
tures—helped determine
the course of history. While
the Vikings had made ear-
lier impressive oceangoing
forays, the Age of Explora-
tion is usually defined as be-
ginning in the early
fifteenth century, when the
Portuguese sent out ships

that sought a sea route to
the Far East. Thus began
what would become a stam-
pede of world exploration
by the European powers.
Perhaps the most dramatic
technological achievement
of the late Middle Ages, one
in which technology served
both religion and art, was
the building of the great ca-
thedrals. Flying buttresses
allowed walls to be higher
and thinner than ever be-
fore, and church interiors
were transformed, suffused
with light that shone
through glorious stained
glass windows. In the thir-
teenth and fourteenth cen-
turies there were stirrings
of renewed interest in scien-
tific inquiry. Planetary ta-
bles formulated under the
patronage of the king of
Castile improved on those
of Ptolemy, and experimen-
tal work on the magnetic
poles constituted a break-
through in scientific meth-
odology. Medical students
again performed dissec-
tions of the human body,
and the first book devoted
to anatomy was published.
