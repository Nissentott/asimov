Vein Valves

That blood moves is cer-
tain, for when an artery is
cut, blood emerges in
spurts. The spurts are in
time with the beating of
the heart, so that the
heart clearly pumps the
blood.

The classical belief, in-
herited from Galen (see
180), was that the blood
was manufactured in the
liver and carried to the
heart, from which it was
pumped outward through
arteries and veins alike and
consumed in the tissues.

Of course, the heart is
actually two pumps, with a
thick muscular wall be-
tween, but there seemed no
reason for two pumps. It
was Galen's notion that
there were small holes in
the wall, too small to be vis-
ible, and that through these
the blood passed, con-
verting the heart into a sin-
gle pump.

In 1603 an Italian phy-
sician, Girolamo Fabrici
(1537â€”-1619), better known
by his Latinized name of
Fabricius ab Aquapen-
dente, studied the veins of
the legs and noted that they

had little valves along their
length.

It was clear that the
valves prevented the blood
from flowing downward.
Muscular action during
walking squeezed the leg
veins and forced the blood
upward because that was
the only direction in which
it could go. This meant that
the blood in the leg veins
could move only teward the
heart.

Fabricius, however,

did not dare to go against
Galen's doetrine and he
refused to draw this
conclusion.
