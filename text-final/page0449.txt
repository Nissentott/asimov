phase was visible. Never-
theless, Schiaparelli did
make out some markings,
and since he always saw
the same markings when
the planet was in a particu-
lar position, he concluded,
in 1889, that Mercury al-
ways presented the same
side to the Sun.

Since Mercury was
close enough to the Sun for
tidal influences to produce
this effect, Schiaparelli's
suggestion was accepted
without serious question
for the next three-quarters
of a century.

Cordite

For four centuries, gunpow-
der had ruled the battle-
field. It produced a smoke
and a stench, however, and
battlefields hidden under a
thickening pall of gunpow-
der smoke made adequate
generalship difficult.

An English chemist,
Frederick Augustus Abel
(1827—1902), worked on the
problem of developing ex-
plosives that would not pro-
duce smoke. In 1889, with
the help of another British
chemist, James Dewar
(1842-1923), he developed
cordite.

Cordite was a mixture
of nitroglycerine (see 1847)
and nitrocellulose (see
1834) to which some petro-
leum jelly was added. The
resulting gelatinous mass
could be squirted out into
cords (hence the name of
the material), which after
careful drying could be
measured out in precise
quantities.

The use of cordite (and
other such smokeless explo-
sives) freed the battlefield
from its cloud. While it
might seem small comfort
that the scene of carnage
and atrocity could be seen
clearly, it was important
militarily, for it allowed
generals to survey a battle’s
progress and better avoid
the casualties that come
about when soldiers blun-
der about uselessly.

Motion Pictures

Once photography had
been invented (see 1839), it
seemed natural to use it to
simulate motion. If photo-
graphs are taken of a mov-
ing object in quick
succession and flashed be-
fore the eyes rapidly, the
eye retains an image of
each for a brief while, so

that all the flashings melt
together and are not seen
as separate images. In-
stead, the object photo-
graphed seems to move.

Such devices were con-
structed, but generally they
showed very brief move-
ments that might be re-
peated over and over again,
Primitive as such devices
were, they amused the audi-
ence.

Edison thought of a
way to extend such illu-
sions and perpetuate them
for a considerable length of
time, He used a strip of
film, of the type brought
into production by East-
man (see 1888), and took a
series of closely spaced pho-
tographs of a moving ob-
ject, which he placed along
its length. The film could
then be moved by means of
perforations along the sides
over sprocket wheels,
which could push the film
in front of a flashing light
at a carefully regulated
speed.

In effect, Edison had in-
vented motion pictures.
With a steady stream of im-
provements, they devel-
oped into a giant industry
as indispensable to modern
life as the automobile.
