A Danish biochemist, Car]
Peter Henrik Dam (1895—
1976), fed hens a synthetic
diet and noticed that on
some diets they developed
small hemorrhages under
the skin and within the
muscles. Vitamin C, which
cures some conditions like
that, didn't help.

He finally decided that
the problem stemmed from
lack of some fat-soluble vi-
tamin not yet known, the
presence of which was nec-
essary for proper coagula-
tion of the blood. He named
it vitamin K (for koagula-
tion, the German spelling of
the word).

This was done in 1934,
but it was not till 1939 that
the American biochemist
Edward Adelbert Doisy
(1893-1986) worked out the
structure of the vitamin
and synthesized it. For this
work, Dam and Doisy
shared the Nobel Prize for
medicine and physiology in
1943.

Rh Factor

After the A, B, and O blood
factors were discovered by
Landsteiner (see 1900),
other blood factors were
discovered that did not in-
terfere with transfusion
and did not involve health
problems (see 1927).

A Russian-born Ameri-

can immunologist, Philip
Levine (b. 1900), was study-
ing erythroblastosis fetalis,
a disease of fetuses and
newborn infants that was
marked by severe destruc-
tion of the red blood cells.
(They were therefore called
blue babies.)

Levine noted, in 1939,
that the mothers in these

cases lacked a blood compo-

nent called the Rk factor
(because it had first been
recognized in the blood of
rhesus monkeys used as ex-
perimental animals). The
mothers were Rli-negative,
but the fathers were RA-
positive, which was geneti-
cally dominant, so that
their offspring were Rh-
positive also. However, the
fetus’s blood apparently
brought about the produc-
tion of antibodies to the
Rh-positive factor in the
mother’s blood. These anti-
bodies filtered into the fe-
tus’s blood and destroyed
the red corpuscles.
Routine testing for Rh
factor prepared physicians
for this possibility, and
the replacement of the in-
fant’s blood supply by new
blood reduced the death
rate.

Penicillin
Fleming had discovered
penicillin (see 1928), but

nothing much came of
it until 1939. Then an

Australian-born British pa-
thologist, Howard Walter
Florey (1898-1968), in col-
laboration with a German-
born British pathologist,
Ernst Boris Chain (1906—
1979), set about isolating
the actual antibacterial
agent from the mold.

They reached their goal
quickly and the ground-
work was laid for penicil-
lin’s use during the dark
days of war that were to fol-
low. As a result, Florey,
Chain, and Fleming were
awarded the Nobel Prize
for medicine and physiol-
ogy in 1945.

Tyrothricin

Most pathogenic bacteria
do not survive well in the
soil, which is why burying
people who have died of dis-
ease does not necessarily
keep epidemics going. It is
possible to reason that this
may be because antibacte-
rial substances are pro-
duced by bacteria that do
commonly live in the soil
and are not pathogenic.
(One might suppose that
there is an evolutionary
benefit for these bacteria in
preventing the invasion of
other species of bacteria.)
The French-born Amer-
ican microbiologist René
Jules Dubos (1901-1982) in-
vestigated the matter and,
in 1939, isolated an antibac-
terial substance from a bac-
