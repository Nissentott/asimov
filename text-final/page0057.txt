ning came to a sudden end.
The Egyptian population
believed it was necessary to
keep the body intact if a
decent status in the after-
life was to be achieved, and
public opinion forced an
end to all dissection at the
Museum. The study of the
human body ceased for
over fifteen centuries as a
result.

Size of Moon
and Sun

It is easy to suppose that
the heavenly bodies are in-
significant in size com-
pared to the enormous
Earth. After all, the stars
are just specks of light on
the vault of a sky that looks
as though it barely clears
Earth’s high mountains.
The Sun and Moon have vis-
ible orbs, but they seem
small too. To suggest other-
wise would certainly have
been considered foolish, or
worse.

Thus, when the Greek
philosopher Anaxagoras
(ca, 500—ca. 428 B.C.) sug-
gested that the Sun was a
rock the size of southern
Greece, he horrified the
Athenian conservatives,
who accused him of irreli-
gion, brought him to trial,
and forced him into exile.

Two centuries had
passed since then, and the
Greek world had expanded

enormously. With its hori-
zons broadened, daring
thoughts were better toler-
ated, and the Greek astrono-
mer Aristarchus (fl. ca. 270
B.c.) was the first to try to
determine the size of the
heavenly bodies.

About 280 B.c., he
noted the size of the
shadow cast by Earth on
the Moon and, following a
correct line of mathemati-
cal argument, estimated
that the Moon was a body
with a diameter one-third
that of the Earth. His result
was a little high because he
lacked the instruments
with which to measure the
shadow accurately.

Aristarchus also tried
to determine the relative
size of the Moon and the
Sun by trigonometry. He
noted that at the time the
Moon was in its half-phase,
the Moon, Sun, and Earth
were at the apexes of a
right triangle. Thus, if the
angles were measured, the
lengths of the sides could
be calculated. Aristarchus’s
mathematics was correct
but again he was victim-
ized by the lack of instru-
ments with which to make
accurate measurements, He
ended by deciding that the
Sun was twenty times as
far from the Earth as the
Moon was and that the Sun
had therefore seven times
the diameter of the Earth.
This turned out to be a

gross underestimate, but
Aristarchus was neverthe-
less the first to show, by sci-
entific reasoning, that the
heavenly bodies were ob-
jects comparable to the
Earth in size.

A consideration of the
Sun'’s huge size possibly led
Aristarchus to maintain
that the Sun, and not the
Earth, was the center of the
Universe, and that the vari-
ous planets, including the
Earth, revolved about the
Sun. He had no evidence
for this, and the notion did
not convince anyone. Even
if the Sun were a huge
body, it was considered an
insubstantial ball of light,
and the thought of the
solid, heavy Earth revolv-
ing around it seemed ridicu-
lous.

Lighthouse

The Hellenistic realms did
not hesitate to show their
advanced technologies in
the form of large architee-
tural underiakings. The is-
land of Rhodes, for
instance, celebrated its suc-
cessful resistance to a siege
by a Macedonian general in
305-304 B.c. by having a
large statue of the Sun-god
constructed overlooking its
harbor. That statue was
105 feet high and was com-
pleted in 280 B.c. [t was
called the Colossus of
Rhiodes. 1t stood for sixty
