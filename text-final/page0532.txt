pointed out in 1916 that the
electron arrangements
seemed to be particularly
stable when the outermost
shell contained eight elec-
trons (or two, in the special
case of helium). An atom
with eight electrons in an
outer shell and then one
outside that (as in sodium
or potassium) would so
readily lose that one super-
fluous electron that it
would be a very active ele-
ment. An atom with seven
electrons in its outermost
shell (as in chlorine or bro-
mine) would so readily ac-
cept an additional one that
it would be reactive also
And of course, atoms that
had eight electrons in their
outermost shell (as in the
noble gases) or two (as in
the special case of helium)
would have little or no ten-
dency to lose or gain an
electron and so would be
chemically inert.
Moreover, two chlorine
atoms might each contrib-
ute an electron to a shared
pool, so that each would
have eight electrons in its

 

 

outermost layer (its own
seven plus one of its neigh-
bor’s which it was sharing).
Naturally, in order to be
able to share electrons, the
two atoms would have to re-
main in close contact, so
that chlorine exists as two-
atom molecules, and it
takes energy to pull those
atoms apart.

This sort of reasoning
also accounted for other
bonds routinely found in or-
ganic molecules among car-
bon, oxygen, hydrogen, and
nitrogen atoms. And Lewis
showed from a consider-
ation of electron arrange-
ments why various
elements had the valences
(see 1852) they did and why
valence varied regularly
over the periodic table.

Langmuir (see 1913)
worked out a similar sys-
tem of chemical bonding in-
dependently, and the
English chemist Nevil Vin-
cent Sidgwick (1873-1952)
soon pointed out that the
Lewis-Langmuir notions
applied to complicated in-
organic molecules as well.

 

Super-
heterodyne
Receiver

Until now, radio operation
had been a rather compli-
cated thing that had to be
left to radio engineers. In
1916, however, the Ameri-
can radio engineer Edwin
Howard Armstrong (1890—
1954) worked out a system
for lowering the frequency
of electromagnetic waves
and then amplifying them.
He called this a superhetero-
dyne receiver,

The addition of such de-
vices to radios made them
far easier to use. The turn
of a dial was all that was
needed to get good recep-
tion, or to transfer recep-
tion from one wavelength
to another. It was only after
such devices were widely
adopted that radios could
be operated by anyone, so
that they entered the home
and became a vehicle for
mass entertainment and in-
formation.
