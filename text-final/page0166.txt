Air Pressure
and Altitude

If the mercury column of
Torricelli's barometer (see
1643) were held up by air
pressure, then if one went
up high in the air, there
should be less air above,
and the air pressure should
decrease. Therefore, so
should the height of the
mercury column.

To test this, Pascal (see
1642) sent his brother-in-
law up a neighboring moun-
tain with a couple of barom-
eters. His brother-in-law
climbed about a mile and
found that the mercury col-
umns had dropped from 30
to 27 inches.

This showed clearly

that the atmosphere could
only have a finite height. In
fact, if it were as dense
throughout as it was at sea
level, it would be only 5
miles in height.

Even when it became
apparent that air became
less dense with height, so
that quantities of it ex-
tended far higher than 5
miles, there had to be lim-
its. At a height of 100 miles
or so, air would be so thin
that it might as well be vac-
uum, and so for all the rest
of the distance to the Moon
and to other heavenly bod-
ies.

Experiments like those
of Torricelli and Pascal’s
brother-in-law amounted
to the discovery of outer

space.

Fluid Pressure

About 1648, Pascal also
studied fluid pressure by ex-
erting pressure on water
and noting how that pres-
sure was transmitted
against the walls of a
closed vessel. He concluded
that when pressure is ex-
erted on a fluid in a closed
vessel, it is transmitted un-
diminished throughout the
fluid and that it pushes at
right angles to all surfaces
that it touches. This is
called Pascal’s principle and
is the basis of the hydraulic
press.
