1403

 

Quarantine

Despite the fact that noth-
ing was known about how
disease came to be (except
for the usual theories of
punishment by God or in-
festation by demons), peo-
ple did tend to avoid those
who were sick with some
particularly fatal or loath-
some disease.

Thus, leprosy (undoubt-
edly along with less drastic
skin diseases) was treated
as something that required
isolation. Lepers were
driven out of society.

When the Black Death

struck, people instinctively
fled from those affected
(sometimes leaving the
dying to die and the dead
to remain unburied).

In 1403 the city of Ven-
ice, always rationally ruled,
decided that recurrences of
the Black Death could best
be averted by not allowing
strangers to enter the city
until a certain waiting pe-
riod had passed. If by then
they had not developed the
disease and died, they
could be considered not to
have it and would be al-
lowed to enter.

The waiting time was

eventually standardized at
forty days (perhaps because
forty-day periods play an
important role in the
Bible). For that reason, the
waiting period was called
quarantine, from the French
word for “forty.”

In a society that knew
no other way of fighting dis-
ease, quarantine was better
than nothing. It was the
first measure of public hy-
giene deliberately taken to
fight disease.
