Mechanical
Clocks

The first advance over the
water clock (see 270 B.c.)
came in the fourteenth cen-
tury. Instead of being
driven by a rise in water
level, the dial on the clock
face was driven by the

downward pull of gravity
on weights.

The resulting mechani-
cal clocks did not tell time
more accurately than water
clocks did, but they were
more convenient and re-
quired less care. They could
be mounted in a tower
(either of the city hall or of
the town church) for all to

see. One was erected in
Milan, Italy, in 1335, for in-
stance. It struck the hour,
and for the first time citi-
zens could learn the time
(to the nearest hour, at any
rate) by listening to the
number of times the bell
rang. (The very word clock
is from the French word for
“bell.”)
