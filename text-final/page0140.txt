unable to account for the
fact that his messages were
being read, complained to
Pope Sixtus V (1521-1590)
that the French were using
sorcery and ought to suffer
ecclesiastical punishment
as a result.

Knitting
Machines

It is possible to build a de-
vice that will imitate the
motions of the hands or
feet, where such motions
are endlessly repeated and
do not call for the guide of
continuous intelligence.

 

In 1589 an English cler-
gyman, William Lee
(1550?â€”1610), invented a
device called a stocking
frame that would knit
faster than hand-knitters
could produce their prod-
ucts. This great advantage
of the stocking frame was
also its great disadvantage,
for if it were put into opera-
tion on a large scale, it
would throw hand-knitters
out of work. Elizabeth I of
England refused to grant
Lee a patent for that very
reason.

Lee therefore took his
machine to France where
he received the necessary
support.

Lee's experiences in En-
gland are an early example
of how the threat of techio-
logical unemployment can
slow technological ad-
vance. To be sure, techno-
logical advance creates
more new jobs than it de-
stroys, but there is always a
painful transition period,
and a humane government
must help those who suffer,
not so much out idealism
(though what is wrong with
that?) as to keep society sta-
ble and to make it easier to
extend the benefits of tech-
nological advance to soci-
ety in general.
