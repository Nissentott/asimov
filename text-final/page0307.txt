mistakes for that reason

 

many of his figures w

atomic weight table was far
more correct than Dalton's
(see 1803) and was the first

many modern values,
Berzelius also pre-
sented the molecular
weights of various com-
pounds. These are easily ob-

weight of the individual
atoms and know which
atoms and how many of
each go to make up the mol-
ecules of a compound.
