He measured the rate at
which gases diffused
through a plaster of pa
plug, through fine tubes,
and through a tiny hole in a
platinum plate.

By 1831 he was re
to announce that the ra
diffusion of a gas is in-
versely proportional to the
square root of its molecular
weight. Thus, since gen
molecules are sixteen times
as massive as hydrogen
molecule: the square
root of sixteen is four, the

5 as
quickly as oxygen. This is
still called Graham's law,

Cyclonic Storms

ticed the manner in which
the trees had fallen and de-
duced that, as the storm
had traveled northeast-
ward, the winds had spi-
raled.

He spent the next ten
vears studying ms and
in 1831 published his evi-
dence to the effect that
storm winds whirl count
clockwise around a center
that r normal
direction of the prevailin
winds.

Eventually it was dis
covered that this was true
only in the northern hemi-
sphere. In the southern
hemisphere, storm winds
whirl clockwise.
