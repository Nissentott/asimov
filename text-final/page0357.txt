 

condition and often bleed-
ing, were much more sus-
ceptible than the doctor,
who generally escaped in-
fection. In the United
States, Holmes (see 1846)
took this attitude and pub-
lished his opinions, but was
paid little heed.

In Vienna, a Hungarian
physician, Ignaz Phillipp
Semmelweiss (1818—1865),
thought so, too, and when
he gained control of a hospi-
tal in 1847, he began to
force the doctors to wash
their hands in a solution of
calcium chloride before
touching patients. This was
unpleasant for the doctors,
of course, especially those
older ones who were proud
of the “hospital odor” of
their hands.

The incidence of puer-
peral fever went down dras-
tically following
Semmelweiss’s ruling, but
this did not impress the re-
bellious doctors. When
Hungary revolted against
Austria in 1849, the Aus-
trian doctors used Semmel-
weiss’s Hungarian origins
as a way of forcing him out.
The hand-washing stopped
and the incidence of puer-
peral fever went up again
at once—which didn't dis-
turb the doctors.

It was not until the
cause of infection was fi-
nally understood, some
twenty years later, that doc-

tors began to reconcile
themselves to washing
their hands.

Painless
Childbirth

A British obstetrician,
James Young Simpson
(1811-1870), heard of the
American experience with
anesthesia (see 1846) and
adopted it at once. Dislik-
ing ether, however, he
made use of chloroform
(much more dangerous, ac-
tually). Beginning in 1847,
he was the first to adminis-
ter anesthesia to women in
childbirth.

There were preachers
who objected to this, since
God had cursed Eve when
she was cast out of Eden
and told her that she would
bear children in “pain and
sorrow.” The preachers
(who were all men) seemed
to feel that pain and serrow
were just what women
needed. In 1853, however,
Simpson used chloroform
to help deliver Queen Victo-
ria’s seventh child. The
preachers, forced to choose
between God and the
queen, chose the queen, of
course, and all eriticism
ceased.

Nitroglycerine
For five centuries, gunpow-
der had been the explosive
par excellence, but now
chemists were coming up
with explosives that were
much more powerful.

In 1845 a German
chemist, Christian
Friedrich Schonbein (1799—
1868), accidentally spilled a
mixture of nitric and sulfu-
ric acids on his kitchen
table. He snatched up his
wife’s apron to mop it up
and then hung the wet
apron over the stove to dry.
It dried, and when it was
dry enough, it went poof
and disappeared. The aston-
ished Schonbein experi-
mented further and found
he had discovered nitrocel-
lulose, or as it came to be
called, guncotton.

In 1847 an Italian
chemist, Ascanio Sobrero
(1812—-1888), using the
same mixture of nitric and
sulfuric acids, combined it
with glycerine and pro-
duced nitroglycerine. When
he heated a single drop in a
test-tube, it exploded with
such force that the horrified
Sobrero did no further
work on it.

Nitrocellulose and ni-
troglycerine were entirely
too explosive to be worked
with safely, but each was
tamed and put to work, ini-
tiating the era of modern
