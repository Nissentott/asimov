1683

 

Bacteria

In 1683 Leeuwenhoek (see
1676) made his most re-
markable discovery.
Through one of his little
lenses he saw what he

thought were living things
far smaller than his animal-
cules. They were just barely
at the limit of what he
could see in his lenses, and
it is a tribute to the excel-
lence of his grinding that

he saw what no one else
could see for another cen-
tury. In hindsight, we know
that what Leeuwenhoek
had discovered were bacte-
ria.
