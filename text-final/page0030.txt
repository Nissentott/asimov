Mathematics
and Astronomy

The concept of mathemat-
ics is as old as human be-
ings. Even some animals
have a primitive number
sense.

It is certainly difficult
to believe that the pyra-
mids, for instance, could
have been built without
substantial ability in geom-
etry.

The Sumerians, and
the Babylonians who suc-
ceeded them, were the first
to make significant ad-
vances in mathematics and
in astronomy. By 1800 B.c.,
they had developed a num-
ber system based on 60 that
we still follow in some

 

1700 B.c., the horsemen
drove down into Canaan
and then even into Egypt,
which fell to alien invaders
for the first time, and also
into India.

Such invasions spread
devastation in the settled

ways, since we still have 60
seconds to the minute and
60 minutes to the hour.
Why 60? Because it can be
evenly divided by 2, 3,4, 5,
6,10, 12, 15, and 30, thus
eliminating the frequent
need of fractions—with
which the ancients had
trouble.

In addition, there are
360 degrees (6 x 60) in the
circle. Again, it is a number
easily divided. In addition,
the Sun takes 365 days to
move completely around
the sky, so that it travels,
relative to the stars, just
about 1 degree per day.
That too may have influ-
enced the choice of 360.

The sky-watchers of the
Tigris-Euphrates valley
eventually discovered that,

    

areas, but they did tend to
stir things up. They helped
change ways of life that

had perhaps become some-
what decadent, and encour-
aged the flow of new ideas
from one settled place to an-
other.

   

in addition to the Sun and
Moon, five bright stars
changed position against
the remaining “fixed” stars.
These moving stars, which
we call planets (from a
Greek word for “wander-
ing"") were given the names
of gods and goddesses, and
we still do that today. We
call the five bright stars
Mercury, Venus, Mars, Jupi-
ter, and Saturn. The pres-
ence of seven such planets
(if we include the Sun and
the Moon) gave rise to the
seven-day week, with one of
the planets in charge of
each day. The week as a
unit of time was thus insti-
tuted by the Babylonians
and was adopted first by
the Jews, then by the Chris-
tians, and through them, by
