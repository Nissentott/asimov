Law of Octaves

By this time, over sixty ele-
ments were known, and
they seemed to represent
an unruly jungle of charac-
teristics. Chemists were un-
easy with that, so they tried
to group elements into fam-
ilies. Several attempts had
already been made, but an
English chemist, John Alex-
ander Reina Newlands
(1837-1898), tried some-
thing a bit different.

He listed the elements
in order of atomic weight
and found that the second
seven repeated the proper-
ties of the first seven quite
closely. He tried to extend
this further, referring to it
as the law of octaves (as in
music, where the same
seven notes are repeated
over and over, with every
eighth note resembling the
first octave higher, octave
coming from the Latin
word for “eight").

Newlands’s work was
not taken seriously, be-
cause the list of elements fit
the law of octaves very im-
perfectly. Nevertheless, it

helped put the listing of ele-
ments in vogue, and in the
course of the following de-
cade a much superior table
was established.

Constitution of
the Stars

Granted that the elements
in the Sun seemed to be the
same as those on Earth (see
1859), might it be argued
that the Solar System
would naturally be made of
one set of materials but
that other stars might be
made of other elements?

The English astrono-
mer William Huggins
(1824—1910) studied the
spectra of some of the
brighter stars and an-
nounced in 1863 that their
spectral lines were those of
the old familiar elements.
Presumably, then, the en-
tire Universe was made up
of the same elements.

 

 

Barbiturates

In 1863 the German chem-
ist Adolf von Baeyer (1835—
1917) discovered barbituric
acid. (There is a story that
he named it for a girlfriend
of the moment whose name
was Barbara.) Barbituric
acid is the parent substance
of a family of compounds
known as barbiturates,
which are well known
today for their use in sleep-
ing pills.

Indium

A German mineralogist,
Ferdinand Reich (1799—

1882), suspected that a yel-

low precipitate he had ob-

tained from a zinc ore

might contain a new metal. |
Because he himself was col-
or-blind, Reich had his as-
sistant, Theodor Richter
(1824—1898), examine it
spectroscopically. Richter
did so and spotted an
indigo-colored line that
was not characteristic of
any known element. The
new element was therefore
named indivm.
