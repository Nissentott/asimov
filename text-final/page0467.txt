Oscilloscope

In 1897 a German physi-
cist, Karl Ferdinand Braun
(1850-1918), modified the
cathode-ray tube in such a
way that the spot of green
fluorescence formed by the
stream of speeding parti-
cles shifted in accordance
with the electromagnetic
field set up by a varying cur-
rent.

The device was called
an oscilloscope, because the
spot could follow and re-
veal the oscillations of the
field. Braun's device was
the ancestor of the present-
day television screen.

Large Refracting
Telescope

The first telescope that Gali-
leo used was a refracting
telescope, making use of
lenses only. In the nearly

three centuries since, such
telescopes had grown
larger and more elaborate

In 1897 Clark, the dis-
coverer of Siriusâ€™s dim com-
panion (see 1844),
supervised the construction
of a refracting telescope
with a lens 40 inches
across. It was the largest
and best refractor built up
to that time, but it had
reached the limits of the
art. No larger refractor has
been built since then, or is
likely to be built. All larger
telescopes are of the re-
flecting variety that New-
ton invented (see 1668).

Diesel Engine

The four-stroke engine in-
vented by Otto (see 1876)
used low-boiling gasoline
for fuel and ignited the va-
por-air mixture with an
electric spark.

A German inventor, Ru-

doll Diesel (1858-1913)
tried to

 

iminate the com-
plexities that resulted from
running an electrical sys-
tem in conju
engine. By 1897 he had per-
fected a Diesel engine that
ignited the vapor-air mix-
ture by the heat developed
through compression. This
allowed him to use higher
boiling fuel such as kero-
sene, which was cheaper
and less inflammable
(hence safer) than gasoline.
However, the compres-
sion had to be great, so the
Diesel engine had to be con-
siderably larger and heav-
ier than the Otto engine il
the higher pressures were
to be brought about and
maintained. Diesel eng
therefore found their use in
heavy transport vehicles

ion with an

 

 

 

 

 

such as trucks, buses, loco-
motives, and ships.
