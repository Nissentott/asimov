Genetic
Medicine

During the 1980s, research-
ers began identifying spe-
cific genes that were
related to particular ill-
nesses, as well as methods
for treating illness on the
genetic level. Early break-
throughs included identifi-
cation of genes that, when
defective, cause cystic
fibrosis (CF), Duchenne
muscular dystrophy, neuro-
fibromatosis, cardiomyopa-
thy, Huntington’s disease,
certain cancers, and vari-
ous illnesses related to a
weakened immune system.
One successful thera-
peutic method involved dis-
arming a virus, inserting
into it copies of a normal
gene, then introducing the
virus into an environment
dominated by defective
genes. For example, in labo-
ratory experiments re-
searchers were able to
“cure” CF; they used a
virus to transfer copies of
the normal CF gene into dis-
eased cells, which regained
the ability to keep clear of
the sticky CF mucus that

 

damages the lungs and
other organs.

In 1990 American phy-
sicians R. Michael Blaese
(b. 1939) and W. French An-
derson (b. 1936), working at
the National Institutes of
Health, conducted the first
successful human gene ther-
apy on a four-year-old girl
who suffered from a genetic
immune system disorder
caused by the deficiency of
a particular protein. They
removed white blood cells
from the girl's blood-
stream, used harmless vi-
ruses to “infect” the blood
cells with genes that would
produce the protein, then
infused the cells back into
her body. This therapy had
to be repeated periodically
as the supply of altered
blood cells died off; never-
theless, it was a major im-
provement over earlier
treatments that were more
painful, more costly, and
less effective in improving
the child’s resistance to in-
fection.

Scientists working on
the international Human
Genonie project, created in
the late 1980s, have pre-
dicted that they will com-

plete the mapping of the
entire human genetic code
early in the twenty-first cen-
tury.

Genetic medicine has
not proceeded without con-
troversy. On the positive
side, it promises the ability
to accurately predict and ef-
fectively treat disease. Crit-
ics fear, however, that gene
therapy could lead to dis-
crimination against people
with genetic profiles that
are perceived as liabilities
(for example, a predispo-
sition to a disease or to
homosexuality) or to unan-
ticipated negative conse-
quences (such as the
stimulation of cancers or
other illnesses). Some even
fear that, taken far enough,
it could lead to social engi-
neering reminiscent of the
experiments of the Nazis.

Hubble Space
Telescope

On April 24, 1990, after
four decades of planning,
the shuttle Discovery sent
the Hubble Space Tele-
scope (HST) into orbit 381
miles above Earth. Named
