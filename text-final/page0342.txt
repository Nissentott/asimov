plexity than anyone else

He began, in 1839, by study-
ing a compound of cerium,
an element that had al-
ready been isolated from a
rare earth mineral. In the
process, he found a new ele-
ment, which he named lan-
thanum, from a Greek word
meaning “hidden,” because

it had been hidden so
effectively in those
minerals.

In the next few years,
he isolated four other ele-
ments from the rare earth
minerals: yttrium, erbium,
terbium, and didymium.
The first three were named
from syllables of Ytterby,

 

 

the quarry in Sweden
where the first rare earth
mineral had been obtained.
The last was named from
the Greek word for “twin,”
because it seemed so simi-
lar in properties to lantha-
num. In fact, all rare earth
elements are remarkably
similar to each other.

 

 

Thermo-
chemistry

The study of combustion
and of the heat developed
in chemical reactions had
languished since the time
of Lavoisier (see 1769).
Then a Russian chem-
ist, Germain Henri Hess

(1802-1850), took up the
matter and measured the
amount of heat developed
by a wide variety of chemi-
cal reactions. In 1840 he an-
nounced what is now
known as Hess's law, that
the amount of heat devel-
oped (or absorbed) in going
from substance A to sub-
stance B is always fixed, re-

gardless of the route by
which the change is
brought about.

The dependence on
starting and ending points
only, without concern for
the path between, was al-
ready understood in con-
nection with heat engines
such as the steam engine.
Hess's law made it seem
