Four decades had passed
since Cayley had built the
first glider capable of car-
rying a human being (see
1853). Now a German aero-
nautical engineer, Otto

1892

Lilienthal (1848—1896),
made them into things of
grace and ability. As early
as 1877 he had shown that
curved wings were superior
to flat wings as far as glid-
ing was concerned. In 1891
he launched himself on his

first glide. He died a few
years later in a crash land-
ing, but he made gliding
popular, and it turned out
to be not too long a step
from a glider to an air-
plane,

 

Amalthea

Galileo had discovered the
four large satellites of Jupi-
ter (see 1610). In the inter-
val since, no other Jovian
satellite had been discov-
ered, even though Saturn, a
smaller and more distant
planet, was known to have

eight satellites by this time.

The American astrono-
mer Edward Emerson Bar-
nard (1857—1923) reasoned,
as Hall had in connection
with Mars (see 1877), that a
fifth satellite, if it existed,
would have to be small and
close to Jupiter. He
searched the neighborhood
of Jupiter and in 1892 spot-
ted a satellite only 112,500
miles from Jupiter's center
and only 68,000 miles
above Jupiter’s cloud sur-
face. We now know it to be
only 125 miles in diameter.

It was variously called
Barnard's satellite and Jupi-
ter V (because it was the
fifth satellite to be discov-
ered), but the French as-

tronomer Camille
Flammarion (1842—1925)
suggested it be named
Amalthea, after the goat (or
nymph) that served as wet-
nurse for Jupiter (Zeus) dur-
ing the god's infancy.

Amalthea was the
twenty-first satellite to be
discovered and the last to
be discovered without pho-
tography.

Light Pressure

From Maxwell’s equations
(see 1865) one could deduce
that light ought to exert a
pressure, albeit a very fee-
ble one. The Russian physi-
cist Pyotr Nikolayevich
Lebedev (1866—1912)
checked the point by mak-
ing use of very light mir-
rors ina vacuum. In 1892
he was able to observe and
measure the pressure ex-
erted by light.

Fitzgerald
Contraction

For five years the negative
results of the Michelson-
Morley experiment had
puzzled physicists. The
irish physicist George Fran-
cis FitzGerald (1851-1901)
offered an explanation in
1892.

He suggested that dis-
tances contracted with
speed. If a light source sped
along toward point A at a
certain velocity, then the
light it emitted in the direc-
tion of that velocity had to
cover a slightly smaller dis-
tance to reach point A than
light emitted in other direc-
tions. The faster the source
moved, the shorter the dis-
tance light would have to
travel to reach a point that
would seem to be a fixed
distance away to a mo-
tionless observer. That
change in distance would
keep the light moving in dif-
ferent directions in phase,
