than one way). Thus, 4 = 2
+2;6 =3+ 3;8=5+3;
10=5+512=7+5; 14
=7+7;16 =11 + 5;18
=13+ 5;20= 13 + 7; 22
=11+ 11;24 = 13 + 11;

13;34 = 17 + 17; 36 = 23
+13;38 =19+ 19;40 =
23 + 17;42 = 23 + 19; and
so on.

No mathematician has
ever found an even number
higher than 2 that could
not be expressed as the sum
of two prime numbers.
Every mathematician is
convinced that no such
number exists and that
Goldbach's conjecture is
true. However, no mathe-
matician has ever been able
to prove the conjecture.

But that sort of thing is
the excitement of mathe-
matics and of science gener-
ally. We shall never run out
of problems, and some will
always remain incredibly
tantalizing.

Franklin Stove

Originally, campfires were
built in the open, or inside
a cave. Fires in confined
areas presented a problem
with smoke, so chimneys
had to be invented. Fire-
places and chimneys are
wasteful, however. Hot air
from the fire goes straight
up the chimney and does
not warm much of the
room. Indeed, the rising hot
air creates a draft that
brings cold air in from the
outside.

It occurred to Benja-
min Franklin (see 1733)
that what was needed was
an iron stove within a
room. Inside that a fire
could be built that would
create no draft but would
heat up the metal. That in
turn would heat the air,
and the warm air would
stay inside the room in-
stead of vanishing up a
chimney. As for the smoke,
that could pass through a
stovepipe into the chimney.

Stoves of this sort grew
instantly popular, and in-
deed, the modern home fur-
nace in the basement is a
kind of Franklin stove.
