number of carbon atoms,
the waste product was a
benzene ring attached to a
two-carbon fragment. Fatty
acids with an odd number
of carbon atoms produced a
benzene ring attached to a
one-carbon fragment.
From this, Knoop de-
cided that fatty acids were
broken down in the body
by having two-carbon frag-
ments snipped off, one after
the other, to the point
where the next snip would
involve a benzene ring.
They were probably also
built up two carbons at a
time, so that the fatty acids
that occur naturally in liv-
ing things always have
even numbers of carbon
atoms. (Those with odd
numbers that Knoop
worked with were synthe-
sized in the laboratory.)
The benzene ring acts
like a label attached to the
molecule, one that allows
the final fragment of the
molecule to be identified. It
is considered a fracer, be-
cause it enables scientists
to trace the route of a par-
ticular compound as it
works its way through in-
termediary metabolism.
Of course the benzene
ring is not a natural compo-
nent of the fatty acids, and
there was always the
chance that the presence of
this unnatural grouping
might distort the workings
of intermediary metabo-

lism. Ideally, a tracer
should be perfectly natural
and yet perfectly identifi-
able at the same time. That
seemed too much to ask for,
but such tracers were even-
tually found.

Novocaine

Alkaloids such as cocaine
and morphine are ex-
tremely useful as painkill-
ers, but they have serious
physiological effects and
are addictive. Plants, after
all, do not make them for
the sake of animals, but for
self-protection.

Organic chemists
strove to modify the alka-
loid molecule in an effort to
find a substitute that kept
some of the good aspects
while losing some of the
bad ones. In 1904, for in-
stance, a molecule named
novocaine, or procaine, was
found, with a structure
something like part of a co-
caine molecule. It acted as
a local anesthetic but was
much safer to use than co-
caine, so that it became
highly important to den-
tists.

Chemists weren't al-
ways so lucky. In 1898 a
modified molecule of mor-
phine was found to be even
more effective as a pain-
reliever than morphine
itself. After a few years, it
was recognized to be even
more dangerous and ad-
dictive. It was heroin.

Star Streams

When Halley first noted
that stars moved (see 1718),
astronomers strove to deter-
mine the motions of as
many stars as possible, and
the usual conclusion was
that they moved randomly.

The Dutch astronomer
Jacobus Cornelis Kapteyn
(1851-1922) found out dif-
ferently. Observing numer-
ous stars, he was able to
conclude by 1904 that there
were two huge streams of
stars moving in opposite di-
rections; three-fifths of the
stars were in one, and two-
fifths in the other, The rea-
son for this wasn't clear,
but at least it showed that
there was order to the
movement of the many mil-
lions of stars that made up
the Milky Way Galaxy. The
nature of that order be-
came clear a quarter-
century later.

Jupiter's Outer
Satellites

The large satellites had by
now all been discovered,
but there still remained
small ones to find. In 1904
the American astronomer
Charles Dillon Perrine
(1867â€”1951) discovered a
small satellite circling Jupi-
ter. It was the sixth to be
discovered and was no
more than 110 miles across.
The next year he discovered
