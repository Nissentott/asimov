1905 belonged to Albert
Einstein. Working on the
speed of light, he deduced
his special theory of relativ-
ity, which described the ef-
fect of velocity on mass and
time-flow. The special rela-
tivity theory led to the idea
that mass is a highly con-
centrated form of energy.
In 1916 Einstein extended
this theory to systems mov-
ing relative to each other,
thus creating the general
theory of relativity. Ein-
stein’s two relativity theo-
ries and the discipline of
quantum mechanics, in-
vented in 1926, form the
theoretical foundation of
twentieth-century physics.
The first humanly engi-
neered nuclear reaction oc-
curred in 1919, when
Ernest Rutherford con-
verted one type of atom
into another by subatomic
bombardment. It wasn't
until 1939, after scientists
learned that the uranium
nucleus could be broken in
two (nuclear fission), that
Leo Szilard discerned how
to create a more powerful
nuclear chain reaction and
thus the nuclear bomb. In

1895

July 1945, scientists ex-
ploded the first nuclear fis-
sion bomb and changed the
course of global war and
politics. The new theories
in physics and improve-
ments in telescopes gave
rise to dramatic findings
about the makeup of the
Universe. In 1918 Harlow
Shapley showed that our
Solar System is nowhere
near the center of the Milky
Way Galaxy, as had been
supposed. Five years later
Edwin Powell Hubble dem-
onstrated that the size of
the Universe was far
greater than had been
thought. Basing his theoriz-
ing on equations that were
part of Einstein's general
theory of relativity, Willem
de Sitter claimed in 1917
that the Universe was ex-
panding. In 1927 Georges-
Henri Lemaitre ran this the-
ory backward to the begin-
ning of time, when what he
called the cosmic egg ex-
ploded and started the ex-
panding Universe; in honor
of that initial explosion,
Lemaitre's idea is called
the big bang theory. Ad-
vances in medicine began

to grow exponentially. Re-
searchers determined the
means by which many dis-
eases were spread, among
them malaria, yellow fever,
and typhus, and a treat-
ment for syphilis was dis-
covered. The discovery in
1935 that the compound
sulfanilamide had antibac-
terial properties led to the
synthesis of the sulfa drugs.
[n 1939 the powerful anti-
bacterial agent penicillin
was isolated. Among a host
of technological advances,
the invention of antennas
in 1895 made communica-
tion via radio waves possi-
ble for the first time,
clearing the way for Gug-
lielmo Marconi's first send-
ing of wireless telegraph
signals from England to
Newfoundland in 1901. A
continuous signal that rep-
licated the irregular sound
waves of speech and music
was made possible in 1906
with the introduction of
amplitude modulation.
When the superheterodyne
receiver was devised in
1916, radios could be oper-
ated by anyone and came
into wide popular use.

 

X Rays

Work on cathode rays by
Goldstein (see 1876) and by

Crookes (see 1861) had

come to interest a number
of physicists in the subject.
One of them was a German

physicist, Wilhelm Conrad
Réntgen (1845—1923), who
was particularly interested
in the ability of cathode
