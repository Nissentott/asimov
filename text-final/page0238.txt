Nerves

From Greek times, nerves
had been thought to be hol-
low tubes that carried some
sort of subtle fluid, perhaps
in analogy to veins and ar-
teries.

A Swiss physiologist,
Albrecht von Haller (1708—
1777), dismissed this possi-
bility and decided to reach
no decisions on nerves that
could not be demonstrated
by experiment. His experi-
mental work, which he pub-
lished in 1766, showed that

muscles were irritable; that
is, a slight stimulus to the
muscle would produce a
sharp contraction. He also
showed that a stimulus to a
nerve would produce a
sharp contraction in the
muscle to which it was
attached. The nerve was
the more irritable and re-
quired the smaller stimu-
lus.

Haller judged, there-
fore, that it was nervous
stimulation that controlled
muscular movement. He
also showed that the tissues

themselves do not experi-
ence a sensation but that
the nerves channel and
carry the impulses that pro-
duce the sensation.
Furthermore, Haller
showed that nerves all led
to the brain or to the spinal
cord, which were thus
clearly indicated as the cen-
ters of sense perception and
responsive action. For all
this, he is considered the
founder of modern neurol-

ogy.

Spontaneous
Generation

A century before, Redi (see
1668) had shown that mag-
gots were not generated
spontaneously but were
born of the eggs of flies.
That might disprove the
spontaneous generation of
organisms large enough to
see, but since then, scien-
tists had learned of myri-
ads of microorganisms.

Could these arise through
spontaneous generation?
The British naturalist
John Turberville Needham
(1713—-1781) had placed
mutton broth in a glass con-
tainer, killed all microor-
ganisms by heating, and
then sealed the container.
He reported that a few days
later, the broth contained
numerous microorganisms
that must have developed
spontaneously. This experi-
ment, conducted in 1740,

seemed impressive, but
there was some suspicion
that he had not heated the
broth sufficiently and had
not managed to kill all the
microorganisms.

In 1768 the Italian biol-
ogist Lazzaro Spallanzani
(1729-1799) decided to re-
peat the experiment and
make sure. He boiled his so-
lution for one-half to three-
quarters of an hour, then
sealed the flask. No new mi-
croorganisms appeared
