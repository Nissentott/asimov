Cyclic-AMP

Adenylic acid, also known
as adenosine monophos-
phate (AMP), is one of the
nucleotides that make up
the molecular chains of nu-

cleic acids. The American
pharmacologist Earl Wil-
bur Sutherland, Jr. (1915—
1974) had discovered it in
tissue some years earlier,
and in 1960 he worked out
its structure. He found that
the phosphate group was
attached to the rest of the
molecule in two different
places rather than one. A
ring of atoms was thus
formed, and Sutherland
called it eyclic-AMP.

Cyclic-AMP has a pro-
found effect on the course
of metabolism within a

cell, since it apparently con-
trols the way hormones can
penetrate cells. For this
work, Sutherland was
awarded the Nobel Prize
for physiology and medi-
cine in 1971.

Chlorophyll
Synthesis

[n 1960 Woodward (see
1944), who specialized in
synthesizing complex or-
ganic molecules, succeeded
in synthesizing chlorophyll.
