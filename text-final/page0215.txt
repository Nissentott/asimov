Shape of
the Earth

Newton had suggested that,
on the basis of his gravita-
tional theory, the Earth
ought to be an oblate spher-
oid and have an equatorial
bulge, because it was rotat-
ing (see 1687, Universal
Gravitation). Plans were
now being made to check
this prediction by actual
measurement.

If the polar regions
were slightly flattened and
the equatorial regions were
slightly bulging, a degree of
latitude near the poles
should be slightly greater
in mileage than a degree of
latitude near the Equator.
To see if that were so, two
expeditions were sent out
by the French in 1735. One,
under the French geogra-
pher Charles-Marie de La
Condamine (1701-1774),
was sent to Peru, quite near
the Equator. The other,
under the French mathema-
tician Pierre-Louis Moreau
de Maupertuis (1698—1759),
went to Lapland, which
was about as close to the
pole as Europeans could
venture in those days.

The results, when fi-
nally achieved, completely

supported Newton. The de-
gree of latitude was 1 per-
cent longer near the poles
than near the Equator, Sea
level at the Equator, we
now know, is 13 miles far-
ther from the Earth'’s cen-
ter than sea level at the
poles.

Before returning to Eu-
rope, by the way, La Con-
damine explored the
Amazon River region. This
was the first time it had
been explored in depth by a
European since Orellana
(see 1542), and La Condam-
ine brought back the first
rubber and curare to Eu-
rope.

Taxonomy

Carl von Linné (1707—
1778), born in Sweden, is
better known by the Latin-
ized version of his name,
Carolus Linnaeus. Always
interested in plants, he trav-
eled 4,600 miles through
northern Scandinavia,
where he discovered a hun-
dred new species of plants.
He also traveled through
Great Britain and western
Europe.

In 1735 he published
Systema Naturae (Systemns of
Nature), in which he classi-
fied numerous plants, ex-

tending the classification in
later editions to animals.

Linnaeus was remark-
able for the methodical
way he went about his clas-
sifications. Similar species
were grouped into genera
(singular, genus); similar
genera into classes; similar
classes into orders. He de-
scribed each species con-
cisely and gave it a double
name, genus and species (bi-
nomial nomenclature).
Thus, he was the first to
call human beings mem-
bers of the species Homo sa-
piens.

Linnaeus's systematic
process made him the fa-
ther of modern taxonomy
(from Greek words mean-
ing “naming in order’").
What's more, his system of
groups, groups of groups,
groups of groups of groups,
and so on gave his descrip-
tion of living things the ap-
pearance of a tree in which
large branches divided into
smaller branches, those
into smaller still, until the
final twigs were the species.
This made the notion of bio-
logical evolution seem
more natural than ever, but
Linnaeus himself was
strongly antievolution
and clung to the tale in
Genesis.
