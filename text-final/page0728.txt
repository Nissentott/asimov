would yield information
about the atmosphere of Ur-
anus.

Some time before Ura-
nus reached the star, the
starlight suddenly dimmed
and brightened several
times. When Uranus had
passed the star and it
emerged, the same dim-
ming-brightening pattern
occurred in reverse. Appar-
ently Uranus was sur-
rounded by a series of thin
concentric rings that were
opaque enough to obscure
starlight.

In this way, Saturn’s
position as the unique pos-
sessor of rings was lost, al-
though nothing we know of
can duplicate its rings,
which are so large, bright,
and beautiful.

Chiron

On November 1, 1977, Ko-
wall, the discoverer of Jupi-
ter XIII (see 1974), was
studying photographic
plates, searching for aster-
oids in Jupiter’s orbit. He
detected something that
might have been such an as-
teroid, but it was moving at
only one-third the speed
that would have associated
it with Jupiter’s orbit. It
had to be somewhere in the
neighborhood of Uranus.
Eventually Kowall
worked out its orbit and

found that it followed a
markedly elliptical path
that carried it out as far as
Uranus at one end and as
close as Saturn at the
other, completing one turn
about the Sun every 50.7
years. It seemed to be an as-
teroid, but it was the far-
thest one yet discovered,
and by far. It was named
Chiron, after the most fa-
mous centaur in Greek my-
thology.

Inflationary
Universe

The concept of the big bang
did not answer all ques-
tions. Why should the Uni-
verse be divided into stars
and galaxies if it started as
a tiny, unimaginably hot
blob of matter? Why didn’t
the gas expand into a vast
cold blob of undifferenti-
ated matter? Again, why
should the Universe be so
nearly flat? That is, why
should it have a mass that
put it so nearly at the bor-
derline between the possi-
bility of expanding forever
and the possibility of some-
day starting to contract
again?

In 1977 the American
physicist Alan Guth sug-
gested that, from the equa-
tions developed for the
Grand Unified Theory (see
1973, Proton Decay), it

could be argued that the
Universe, in the instants
after the big bang, under-
went a sudden and exceed-
ingly rapid inflation. (While
objects within the Universe
cannot move relative to one
another more rapidly than
the speed of light, the Uni-
verse as a whole could theo-
retically expand at any
speed.)

This period of expan-
sion can be used to explain
some characteristics of the
Universe that the classical
big bang theory cannot, but
the details are elusive, and
the concept of an inflation-
ary universe is still being
worked on by cosmogo-
nists.

Vela Pulsar

For nine years, the pulsar
at the center of the Crab
nebula had been the only
optical pulsar known (see
1969). In 1977 a second opti-
cal pulsar was discovered,
in the Vela nebula, which
seems also to be the rem-
nant of an old supernova ex-
plosion.

Deep-Sea Life

In 1977 it was discovered
that there were ocean
vents, or “chimneys,” that
continually spewed hot
water laden with minerals
into the ocean. Bacteria
