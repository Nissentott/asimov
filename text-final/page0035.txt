Monotheism was a
clear advance over polythe-
ism, since it reduced the
chaos of the supernatural

and made possible a more
orderly theology.

 

Dyes

The human urge to beautify
is irresistable, and since we
can see colors, we usually
find them, singly and in
combination, to be more at-
tractive than black and
white. The Old Stone Age
artists used colored earths
to make their paintings.

As early as 3000 B.c.,
dyes were used to color oth-
erwise white or yellowish
cloth, both in Egypt and in
China. Indigo, a blue color
extracted from a plant, was
used and madder, a red
color extracted from the
root of another plant. By

1400 B.¢., cloth could be
dyed in virtually all colors.

The chief trouble with
most early dyes was that
thev tended to bleach in the
sun and to wash out in
water, so that dyed fabrics
quickly grew dim and
blurred.

One dye that was very
resistant both to sun and
water was obtained from a
snail in the eastern Mediter-
ranean. To obtain the dye
was a tedious task, but the
resultant red-purple color
was brilliant and srayed
brilliant. The city of Tyre in
Phoenicia had developed
this dye industry by 1200

B.C. so that the color was
called Tyrian purple. Be-
tween the difficulty of
amassing a quantity of it,
and its great desirability,
its price went sky-high, but
it still sold, albeit only to
the rich and powerful. Tyre
grew wealthy out of its dye
trade and was able to sup-
port its merchant fleet and
undertake trading ventures
that made it richer still.

Some believe that the
Greek name Phoenicia, ap-
plied to the land in which
Tyre was a city, came from
a Greek word meaning
“red-purple” in reference to
the dye.
