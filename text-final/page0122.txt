Mississippi
River

The interior of the Ameri-
can continents was being
increasingly explored. Cor-
tés explored what is now
northern Mexico and in
1536 discovered the penin-
sula of Baja California.

In 1539 the Spanish ex-
plorer Hernando de Soto
(ca. 1500-1542) was com-
missioned by Charles V to
land in Florida and add it
to the Spanish dominions.
De Soto did more than
that. Over the space of
three years, he explored
what is now the southeast-
ern portion of the United

States. In 1541 he and his
men were the first Europe-
ans to see the Mississippi
River. He crossed it but re-
turned to it in the spring of
1542 and died on its banks,

 

1542

 

Amazon River

One of Pizarro’s aides dur-
ing his conquest of Peru
was Francisco de Orellana
(ca. 1490—ca. 1546), who
was exploring eastward
past the Andes Mountains
when he came upon the
headwaters of a river. He
felt it would be easier to see
where the river led him

than to make his way back
across the formidable
mountain barrier.

From April 1541 to Au-
gust 1542, he progressed
down the river, which as it
happened, was by far the
greatest in the world in
terms of water volume de-
livered to the ocean and
area drained. His report
mentioned tribes that ap-

peared to be led by women.
This reminded people of
the Amazons, the women
warriors of Greek legend,
and the river was named
the Amazon in conse-
quence.

Orellana was the first
European to cross South
America from ocean to
ocean.
