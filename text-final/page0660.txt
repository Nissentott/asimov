counting for Chargaff’s re-
sults).

Each strand of the dou-
ble helix was a model (or
template) for the other. In
cell division, each DNA dou-
ble helix would separate
into two strands, and each
strand would build up its
complementary strand on
itself; an adenine fitting
over every thymine on the
strand, a thymine over
every adenine, a guanine
over every cytosine, and a
cytosine over every gua-
nine. In this way two dou-
ble helixes would appear
where there had been one
before. Thus DNA under-
went replication without
changing its structure ex-
cept for very occasional ac-
cidental errors, which
represented mutations.

The Watson-Crick
structure made so much
sense that it was accepted
at once. Watson, Crick, and
Wilkins shared the Nobel
Prize for physiology and
medicine in 1962 as a re-
sult. By that time Franklin
was dead, and her involve-
ment did not have to be con-
sidered.

Isotactic
Polymers

For over forty years, chem-
ists had been manufactur-
ing polymers, long-chain
molecules built up of sim-

 

ple units. Beginning with
Bakelite (see 1909), these of-
fered a variety of useful
properties and came into
steadily increasing use.

However, the tech-
nique of polymerization
was a matter of random
combination. The simple
units were brought to-
gether and allowed to com-
bine as they wished, so to
speak. The result was that,
instead of a single long
chain, branches sometimes
appeared. If there were
atomic groups attached to
the unit, these would jut
outward in random direc-
tions along the chain. Such
unpredictable aspects of
the polymerization tech-
nigque limited its use-
fulness.

In 1953 a German
chemist, Karl Ziegler
(1898—1973), discovered
that he could use a resin, to
which ions of metals such
as aluminum or titanium
were attached, as a catalyst
in the production of poly-
ethylene. Chains without
branching were then
formed. As a result, the new
polyethylene was tougher
and higher-melting than
the old.

The Italian chemist
Giulio Natta (1903—1979)
carried on this sort of work
and found that he could use
such catalysts to insure
that the side groups of a
unit would all point in the
same direction when a poly-

mer formed. At Mrs.
Natta’s suggestion, these
were called isotactic poly-
mers, from Greek words
meaning “ordered in the
same way.”

Plate Tectonics

For thirty years it had been
known that there was a
mountain range down the
middle of the Atlantic
Ocean. Eventually it was
understood that this was
part of a world-girdling
range called the Mid-
Oceanic Ridge.

In 1953 the American
physicists Maurice Ewing
(1906—-1974) and Bruce
Charles Heezen (1924 -
1977) discovered that a
deep canyon ran the length
of the ridge. It was called
the Great Global Rift. There
were places where the rift
came quite close to land: it
ran up the Red Sea be-
tween Africa and Arabia
and skimmed the borders
of the Pacific through the
Gulf of California and up
the coast of the state of Cali-
fornia.

The rift seemed to
break the Earth’s crust into
plates tightly joined as
though fitted together by a
skilled carpenter. They
were therefore called fec-
tonic plates, from a Greek
word for ““carpenter.” The
study of the evolution of
the Earth'’s crust in terms
of these plates is called
