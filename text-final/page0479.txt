Radioactive
Energy

In 1901 Pierre Curie mea-
sured the heat given off by
radium as it emitted radia-
tion. He determined that
each gram of radium gave
off 140 calories per hour.
This becomes much

more surprising when one
realizes that radium contin-
ues to emit energy at this
rate hour after hour after

hour for years and centu-
ries. It falls off with time,
but only
after 1600 y
energy emission is still half
of what it was at the start.
The total energy emit-
ted by radium (or by radio-
active substances
generally) was far beyond
anything humanity h
rience with in ordinary
chemical
the burning of fuel or the
shattering of explosives.

Curie’s finding was the
first indication that a new

ivity were worked
