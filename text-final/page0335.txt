had extracted a substance
from the stomach lining
that proved particularly ac-
tive in dissolving and di-
gesting meat. He called it
pepsin, from a Greek word
meaning “to digest.”

Pepsin, like diastase
(see 1833), was an enzyme,
but diastase had come from
the plant world. Pepsin was
the first animal enzyme to
be isolated.

Daniell Cell

The batteries that had been
used since the time of Volta
(see 1800), had been uncer-

tain things at best. The
amount of current pro-
duced was erratic and
faded off rather rapidly.
What was needed was a bat-
tery that could be relied on
to deliver a constant quan-
tity of current over a rea-
sonably long time.

In 1836 the British
chemist John Frederic Dan-
iell (1790—1845) produced a
battery, the Daniell cell,
that made use of copper
and zinc electrodes, and
that filled the bill. Even
though the future on a
large scale belonged to gen-
erators of the type that Far-

aday had pioneered (see
1831), there would always
be devices that were small
or mobile or both, that
should carry their own bat-
teries for greater conve-
nience.

 

 

 

Ice Age

For years, Swiss geologists,
notably Venetz, had been
pointing to evidence that
the glaciers of the Alps had
been more extensive in the
past (see 1821). A Swiss nat-
uralist, Louis Agassiz

(1807—-1873), was among
those who refused to accept
these ideas—until he him-
self began to study the evi-
dence.

In 1837 he began to
move ahead of those who
had gone before him to pos-
tulate that ice sheets had

covered far more than
mountainous areas, having
also spread over large sec-
tions of the lowlands in the
northern portions of the
continents. With time he
found evidence of glacia-
tion in Great Britain, and
after he went to the United
