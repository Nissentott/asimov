Stratospheric
Balloons

Human beings had reached
heights of up to 6 miles in
balleons but had done so

at great peril, for the air is
not dense enough at such
heights to be thoroughly ca-
pable of supporti i
1902). Uncrewed balloons
were used to reach greater
heights,

 

This was not satisfac-
tory to the Swiss physicist
Auguste Piccard (1884—
1962), who wanted to study
the ionosphere and cosmic
rays more intimately than
the instruments of the day
made possible. What had to
be done, he felt, was to con-
struct a sealed aluminum
gondola within which a nor-
mal atmosphere could be
maintained however high
the balloon climbed.

In 1931, making use of
such a sealed gondola, Pic-
card ascended to a height
of nearly 10 miles, half
again as high as human be-
ings had ever risen before.
This paved the way for
other and even higher pene-
trations of the stratosphere
by himself and others.
Eventually, heights of
nearly 20 miles were
achieved.

Neutron

For twenty years, it had
been assumed that the
atomic nucleus was made
up of protons and electrons,
since these were the only
two subatomic particles
known. Thus the nitrogen
nucleus had a mass of 14,

 

so it must contain fourteen
protons. On the other hand,
the nitrogen nucleus had an
electric charge of +7,
whereas fourteen protons
would have an electric
charge of +14. Therefore,
the nucleus must have
seven electrons with a
charge of —1 each to neu-

 

tralize the charge of seven
of those protons. The net re-
sult was that the nitrogen
nucleus was theught to be
made up of 14 protons and
7 electrons, or 21 particles
altogether.

But seven years earlier,

smit worked out the con-
