key and it sparked and
crackled just like a Leyden
jar. Moreover, Franklin
charged a Leyden jar from
the key just as easily as if it
were a friction machine.
The Leyden jar charged by
heavenly electricity be-
haved precisely as though
it had been charged by
earthly electricity. The two
electricities were identical.
Franklin was able to
put his discovery to practi-
cal use at once. Lightning,
he decided, hit a particular
building when that build-
ing gathered charge during
a thunderstorm. His experi-
ence with Leyden jars
showed that they dis-
charged much more easily
if a sharp needle was
attached to them. Indeed,
the charge leaked out so
easily through the needle
that they couldn't be
charged in the first place.
Why not, then, attach a
sharp metal rod to the top
of a building, and ground it
properly, so that any
charge that gathered might
leak away rapidly and si-
lently and no charge would
accumulate to the point
where a disastrous dis-
charge would be forced.
Franklin published his
thoughts on the matter in
1752 in Poor Richard's Al-
manac, and the lightning
rods, as they were called,
began to go up at once, first
in America and then in Eu-

rope. They proved effica-
cious, and for the first time
in history, a natural catas-
trophe was averted not by
prayer or by magical incan-
tations of one sort or an-
other, which never really
worked, but by reliance on
an understanding of natu-
ral laws, which did work.
Once lightning rods ap-
peared on church steeples
(which, being the highest
point in town, were particu-
larly vulnerable), the point
was made for all to see.

Digestion

Was digestion a physical ac-
tion (the result of the grind-
ing of the stomach) or a
chemical one (the result of
fermentation)? The contro-
versy had been going on for
a century.

In 1752, a French physi-
cist, René-Antoine Fer-
chault de Réaumur (1683—
1757), induced a hawk to
swallow metal cylinders
that were open at both
ends, with those ends cov-
ered by wire gauze. Inside
the cylinder was meat.

Ordinarily, a hawk
swallows its food in large
pieces, digests what it can,
and regurgitates the indi-
gestible remainder. Ré-
aumur waited for the hawk
to regurgitate the cylinder
and found the meat par-
tially dissolved. Clearly, the
meat could not have been

Lol

affected by grinding or by
any mechanical action,
since the metal cylinders
protected it from that.
Therefore, the stomach
juices must have had a
chemical effect on the
meat.

He checked this further
by persuading the hawk to
swallow a small sponge.
When that was regurgi-
tated, it was soaked with
stomach juice, which Ré-
aumur squeezed out and
collected. He found that
this stomach juice slowly
dissolved meat placed in it.
He experimented with
dogs, too, and obtained the
same results. Muscles and
bones might behave like
mechanical systems, but
the body was a chemical de-
vice as well, and as scien-
tists increasingly
discovered, the chemistry is
even more important than
the mechanics.

Earth and Heat

There is ample evidence
that the Earth's surface has
undergone enormous
changes in its history, and
there must be titanic forces
behind those changes. Up
to this time, most Europe-
ans took it for granted that
the causative factor was
water and, in particular,
the action of Noah'’s Flood,
which was considered a
God-caused cataclysm far
