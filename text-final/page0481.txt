Chromosomes
and Inheritance

Mendel, in working out the
laws of genetics (see 1865),
had suggested that for
every characteristic there
was a pair of factors.
Mother and father each con-
tributed one of that pair to
the offspring, who in this
way inherited characteris-
tics from each parent.

By the time Mendel’s
work had been rediscov-
ered by De Vries and others
(see 1900), the role of chro-
mosomes in cell division had
been worked out by Flem-
ming (see 1882) and their
role in the formation of sex
cells had been researched
by Beneden (see 1883).

In 1902, then, an Ameri-
can geneticist, Walter
Stanborough Sutton (1877—
1916), made a suggestion
that in hindsight seems ob-
vious. He pointed out that
chromosomes were (or con-
tained) the genetic factors
Mendel spoke of. He proved
to be correct,

Secretin

The pancreas begins to se-
crete its digestive juice as
soon as the acid food con-
tents of the stomach enters

the small intestine, How
does the pancreas “know”’
that food, requiring diges-
tion, is making its appear-
ance? The natural
assumption is that the en-
tering food stimulates a
nerve that in turn stimu-
lates the pancreas. The Rus-
sian physiologist Ivan
Petrovich Pavlov (1849—
1936) suggested that this
was So.

Two British physiolo-
gists, Ernest Henry Star-
ling (1866—1927) and his
brother-in-law, William
Maddock Bayliss (1860—
1924), tested the matter.
They cut all the nerves lead-
ing to the pancreas—yet it
still performed on cue.

They then discovered
that the lining of the small
intestine secreted a sub-
stance (which they named
secretin) under the influ-
ence of stomach acid. It
was this secretin that stim-
ulated the pancreatic flow.
In short, then, Starling and
Bayliss had discovered that
it was possible for chemical
messages as well as nerve
messages to exist in the
body.

Eventually other chem-
ical messengers were dis-
covered and Starling
suggested they be called
hormones, from Greek

words meaning “‘to rouse to
activity.” Secretin was the
first hormone to be recog-
nized as such, but epineph-
rine, isolated by Abel (see
1898), turned out to be a
hormone, also.

Animal
Inheritance

Mendel’s work, once redis-
covered, created an enor-
mous stir. The British
biologist William Bateson
(1861-1926) was a strong
supporter of Mendelian
views and translated his pa-
pers into English.

Mendel, together with
the rediscoverers of the
laws of genetics, had
worked with plants, in
which breeding was easier
to control and inheritance
easier to study than in ani-
mals. Bateson showed that
the same laws of genetics
that applied to plants ap-
plied also to animals.

Anaphylactic
Shock

The French physiologist
Charles Robert Richet
(1850-1935) worked on im-
mune sera, the sort of thing
that Behring had used suc-
