Comets’ Orbits

For a century or more, as-
tronomers had been trying
to puzzle out the orbits of
comets. It was clear that
comets’ orbits were nothing
at all like those of the plan-
ets. Some astronomers
thought comets’ passed
through the Solar System
in a straight line. Others
thought they passed
through in parabolas—
coming in from far-off
space, going around the
Sun and out forever.

Once Newton's Prin-
cipia was published, how-
ever (see 1687), it seemed to
many that comets had to be
bound by gravitation as the
planets were.

Halley (see 1678), in an
attempt to prove that this
was so, began collecting
data on comets. Eventually,
when he had listed the
movements of two dozen
comets, he was struck by
the similarity of the path

across the sky of the 1682
comet (which he himself
had observed) with the
paths of the comets that
had appeared in 1607,
1531, and 1456. These four
had come at intervals of
seventy-five or seventy-six
years. It seemed to Halley
that it must be the same
comet, returning regularly.

If that were so, a comet
would have an orbit that
was an ellipse, just as
Earth'’s orbit was, but the
cometary ellipse would be
extremely elongated. At one
end, the comet would ap-
proach close to the Sun; at
the other, it would recede
far beyond Saturn, the far-
thest known planet.

Halley predicted, in a
book written in 1705, that
this same comet would re-
turn about 1758 and that it
would cross the sky in the
same path as in 1682. He
was aware, he said, that the
gravitational influence of
the planets might alter the

orbit somewhat and change
the time of appearance a lit-
tle.

Halley's claim was not
taken seriously at the time,
but it did rouse additional
interest in comets.

Plant
Nourishment

The English physiologist
Stephen Hales (1677-1761)
began experiments on
plants in 1705. His most im-
portant suggestion was that
air contributed to the nour-
ishment of plants, thus cor-
recting Helmont's
misconception of a century
before to the effect that
only water counted (see
1624).

Hales was the first per-
son to collect gases by bub-
bling them through water
and trapping them in an
upside-down vessel.
