Easter Island

Dots of land scattered over
the Pacific remained to be
discovered by Europeans
even two centuries after
Magellan had made the
first crossing (see 1523). In
1722 the Dutch navigator
Jacob Roggeveen (1659—
1729) came across a small
island, 45 square miles in
area, that was one of the

most isolated bits of land in
the world. It was 1,200
miles from the nearest
land, which was another
small island like itself.
Since the island was
sighted on Easter Sunday,
it was named Passeisland
in Dutch, or Easter Island
in English.

Easter Island was prob-
ably the farthest point
reached by the Polynesians

 

in their settlement of the
Pacific Islands (see 1642).
The island is best known
for six hundred stone stat-
ues of a type found no-
where else. This has lent
the island an air of mystery
that it probably doesn’t de-
Serve.

Later in the same voy-
age, Roggeveen discovered
the Samoan Islands.

Ship’s
Chronometer

If a ship wants to locate it-
self on the ocean, it can
measure its latitude (the

distance north or south of
the equator) by taking the
position of the Sun at maxi-
mum height or the position
of the North Star and calcu-
lating the distance of either
from the zenith. To mea-

sure a ship’s longitude (the
distance east or west of its
home port), however, can
be done accurately only if
the exact time is known,
which presented a problem
at this time. A pendulum
