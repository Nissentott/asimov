Anyone looking at the
Earth can see that the land
surface is bumpy and un-
even but on the whole flat.
This is particularly true if
we look out over the surface
of a lake.

The first person we
know of who seems to have
suggested that the Earth
was not flat but spherical
was Pythagoras (see 520
B.c.). It was Aristotle (see
387 B.c.), however, who
summarized the reasons,
possibly about 350 B.c., rea-
sons that still hold today.

As one moves north,
stars rise above the north-
ern horizon and sink below
the southern horizon, while
as one moves south, the re-
verse happens. The shadow
of the Earth on the Moon
during a lunar eclipse is al-
ways a circular arc. When
ships sail away from you at
sea, the hull always seems
to disappear before the su-
perstructure, and this hap-
pens in the same way in
any direction. All these indi-
cate the Earth to be spheri-
cal.

These arguments were
accepted by educated peo-
ple even at low points in in-
tellectual history, yet there
are people today, with an
education of sorts, who
cling to something equiva-
lent to a Flat-Earth Society.
This, of all antiscience

movements, secems the
most indefensible, and one
suspects that they are ei-
ther joking or just a little
mad.

Five Elements

Aristotle (see 387 B.c.) also
summarized earlier
thoughts on the elements of
which the world was com-
posed. Thales (see 580 B.c.)
had suggested that it was
composed of water, while
later philosophers had
named other candidates.

Aristotle suggested that
it was made of four ele-
ments—earth, water, air,
and fire—and that it was
built in consecutive shells.
At the center was a ball of
earth, surrounded by a ball
of water (through which
some earth protruded in
places). This was in turn
surrounded by a ball of air,
and then, still farther out,
by a ball of fire (sometimes
visible as lightning).

The heavens them-
selves, however, were fun-
damentally different from
the world, in Aristotle’s
view, and were made up of
a fifth element, which he
called aether (from a Greek
word meaning “blazing"’).
After all, the heavenly bod-
ies were all luminous, while
the world was dark, except
when it rellected light. The
heavenly bodies moved in
endless circles, while on

Earth bodies fell or rose.
The heavenly bodies were
unchanging and incorrupt-
ible, while on Earth every-
thing changed and
deteriorated.,

This view of Aristotle’s
turned out to be wrong, but
to this day we still speak of
“hghting the elements”
when we face wind and
rain, and when we want to
say that something is the
pure and abstract represen-
tation of anything we call it
a quintessence, from Latin
words meaning “fifth ele-
ment.”’

Animal
Classification

Aristotle (see 387 B.c.) was
a careful and meticulous
observer who was fasci-
nated by the task of classify-
ing animal species.and
arranging them into hierar-
chies. He dealt with over
five hundred animal species
in this way and dissected
nearly fifty of them. His
mode of classification was
reasonable and in some
ways strikingly modern,

He was particularly in-
terested in sea life. He ob-
served that the dolphin
brought forth its young
alive, nourishing its voung
by a special organ called a
placenta before birth and
by milk after it was born.
No fish did this, but all
