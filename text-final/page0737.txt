tion of such vessels that
would be cheaper.

The first shuttle flight
took place on April 12,
1981, which happened, by
coincidence, to be the twen-
tieth anniversary of the
first spaceflight by Gagarin
(see 1961). The shuttle left
and returned safely. It was
the first of over a score of
such flights during the next
four and a half years to be
carried through safely.

Neptune’s Rings

The rings of Uranus had
been discovered by the be-
havior of a star’s light,
which disappeared and re-
appeared as Uranus ap-
proached it and then left it
(see 1977).

In 1981 similar phe-
nomena were noted when
Neptune passed in front of
a star. But the pattern had
been symmetrical as the

star passed into and out of
occultation with Uranus,
and in the case of Neptune
it was not.

The suggestion was
therefore made that Nep-
tune did not have symmet-
rical rings but merely arcs
of ring material that did
not stretch all the way
around the planet. If so,
this is another unprece-
dented situation.

 

 

Millisecond
Pulsar

The fastest pulsar (see
1967) known was in the
Crab nebula and rotated
some 30 times a second,
emitting pulses at that rate.
It was also the youngest
pulsar known, and there
didn't seem to be much
chance of finding a pulsar
still younger and more
rapid.

In 1982, however, a pul-
sar was found that rotated
more than twenty times as
fast, at 642 times per sec-

ond. Moreover, it did not
show signs of being a partic-
ularly young pulsar. There
was a suggestion that it
was (or had been) part of a
double star system and
that, by absorbing matter
from its companion, it had
gained angular momentum
and speeded up.

Other such millisecond
pulsars (those that turn in
the range of a thousandth
of a second) have been dis-
covered since.

Magnetic
Monopole

Maxwell’s equations (see
1865) are not quite symmet-
rical with respect to elec-
tricity and magnetism. The
asymmetry lies in this:
Electricity exists as posi-
tive and negative charges,
and these can be easily iso-
lated—there are particles
with positive charge only
(positrons or protons) and
particles with neg
charge only (electrons or
antiprotons). Magnetism,
xists as north
