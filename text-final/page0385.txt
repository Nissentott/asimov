18-inch lens and was test-
ing it in a telescope by ex-
amining Sirius. He saw a
tiny spot of light near Sir-
ius and thought at first
that it might represent an
imperfection in the lens.
Since other bright stars did
not show such an effect,
however, he concluded that
he was actually seeing the
companion of Sirius. It was
not truly dark, merely dim.
Clark did not know
that he was looking at any-
thing more than a dim star.
It was to be six decades
before the true and most
unusual nature of the com-
panion of Sirius was to be
demonstrated.

Hydrogen in the
Sun

Once Kirchhoff had shown
the use of spectral lines

in determining the con-
stitution of the solar
atmosphere (see 1859),
astronomers began to com-
pare the position of the
dark lines in the solar spec-
trum with the lines pro-
duced by the elements.

In 1862 the Swedish
physicist Anders Jonas
Angsrrém (1814-1874) an-
nounced his discovery of hy-
drogen in the Sun. He went
on, in later years, to pub-
lish a map of the spectrum
in which he located about a

thousand lines, measuring
the wavelengths repre-
sented by each in units
equal to a ten-billionth of a
meter. That unit is still re-
ferred to as the angstrom.

Chloroplasts

Plants seem to be uni-
formly green, and it is easy
to suppose that chlorophyll
is spread uniformly
throughout the cells. That
this is not so was discov-
ered in 1862 by the German
botanist Julius von Sachs
(1832—1897). He noted that
plant cells had discrete bod-
ies in which the chlorophyll
was concentrated. These
bodies were eventually
named chloroplasts. Fur-
thermore, starch grains
appeared within the chloro-
plasts, and Sachs was thus
able to show that starch
was the product of photo-
synthesis.

Source of the
White Nile

Bruce had discovered the
source of the Blue Nile in
northwestern Ethiopia (see
1770), but the White Nile
was the main stream, and
its source was still un-
known.

In 1857 two British ex-
plorers, Richard Francis
Burton (1821~1890) and
John Hanning Speke

(1827-1864), started from
Zanzibar in east central Af-
rica and probed westward
in search of the great lakes
that Arab traders had re-
ported. In February 1858
they reached Lake Tangan-
yika, a long, narrow body of
water 620 miles from the Af-
rican coast.

There, Burton had had
enough and left. Speke,
however, moved northward
on his own and, on July 30,
reached Lake Victoria, in
area the second-largest
body of fresh water in the
world. (Only Lake Superior
is larger.)

In 1862 Speke con-
firmed that a stream issu-
ing from the northern rim
of Lake Victoria was the
Nile River. It was neces-
sary, then, to trace back the
longest river that flowed
into Lake Victoria. That
turned out to be the Luvi-
ronza, which is 715 miles
long and flows into the lake
from the west. The source
of the Luvironza is there-
fore the true source of the
Nile, and it is located in the
modern nation of Burundi
about 35 miles east of Lake
Tanganyika.

Warships

In 1862 the American Con-
federacy raised a scuttled
