maintained that only two
different wavelengths of
light are needed, and that
they don't even have to be
very sharp. One light could
be ordinary white light

with an average wave-
length in the yellow-green.
This would serve as the
short-wave light. Red lig
would serve as the long-
wave light. Thus, red and

 

    

white in combination could

The principle of the maser,
which produced an intense,
coherent, monochromatic
beam of microwaves (sce
1953), could be applied to
any wavelength, including
those of visible light. This
had been pointed out by
Townes (sec 1953).

The first maserlike de-
vice capable of producing
an intense, coherent, mono-
chromatic beam of visible
light was constructed in
May 1960 by the American
physicist Theodore Harold
Maiman (b. 1927), making

use of the three-level princi-
ple worked out by Bloem-
bergen (see 1956)

Maiman designed a
ruby cylinder with its ends
carefully polished flat and

    

parallel and covered with a
thin silver film. Energy was
fed into it from a Nash
lamp until it emitted a
beam of red light.

The coherent light so
produced had only a slight

 

   

   

tendency to spread and
