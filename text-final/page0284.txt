ern science of invertebrate
zoology, Lamarck began the
process of understanding
the importance of inverte-
brate life. All the verte-
brates are included in but a
single phylum, while there
are about twenty-two phyla
of invertebrates. The num-
ber of species of insects
alone far exceeds the num-
ber of species of verte-
brates; indeed, it exceeds
the number of species of all
other animals combined.

Ultraviolet

Herschel's discovery of in-
[rared radiation (see 1800)
naturally created a stir.
Ritter (see 1800) was also
studying the Sun’s spec-
trum, but he was more in-
terested in the chemical
changes it brought about.

1t had been known for
nearly two centuries that
light broke down the white
compound silver nitrate,
darkening it (by liberating
tiny specks of metallic sil-
ver). This was first reported
in 1614 by an [talian chem-
ist, Angelo Sala (1576~
1637).

Ritter soaked strips of
paper in silver nitrate solu-
tion and placed them in dif-
ferent sections of the
spectrum to see how rap-
idly they darkened. He
found that the darkening
was least rapid in the red
end of the spectrum and

took place faster and faster
as one progressed toward
the violet end.

Ritter, perhaps influ-
enced by Herschel's experi-
ence, proceeded to place
strips of soaked paper be-
yond the violet end, where
nothing could be seen.
There the darkening pro-
ceeded faster still. Appar-
ently, there was radiation
beyond the violet end of the
spectrum as well as beyond
the red. The new radiation
was called ultraviolet (the
prefix ultra is from a Latin
word meaning “beyond”’).

Light Waves

The controversy over the
nature of light—whether it
consisted of a stream of par-
ticles or of tiny waves—had
been going on for a century.

In 1801 an English
physicist, Thomas Young
(1773—-1829), began a series
of experiments that seemed
to settle the matter. He
showed, for one thing, that
the kind of diffraction
noted by Grimaldi (see
1665) did exist.

Then too, he allowed
two separate beams of light
emerging from two narrow
slits to overlap and found
interference, for the overlap-
ping beams showed alter-
nate strips of light and
dark.

If light consisted of
waves, then the waves of
the two bands of light

might move up and down
in unison and reinforce
each other in some places.
In other places, one might
move up while the other
moved down, and they
would cancel each other.
Such interference is well
known in the case of sound
waves and water waves.
Streams of particles, on the
other hand, could scarcely
produce interference ef-
fects.

It took a while for
Young's demonstration to
be understood and ac-
cepted, but once it was, it
was seen that light was a
wave phenomenon. The dif-
ferent colors of the spec-
trum marked out light with
different lengths of waves
(or different wavelengths).
Short wavelengths are re-
fracted (bent in their path)
more than long wave-
lengths, so red light (the
least refracted) has the lon-
gest waves, while orange,
vellow, green, blue, and vio-
let have successively
shorter waves. From
Young'’s work, it began to
seem probable that infra-
red radiation had waves
longer than those of red
light, while ultraviolet radi-
ation had waves shorter
than those of violet light.

Because light cast
sharp shadows and the dif-
fraction effects were so
small, light waves had to be
very tiny. Young calculated
from his interference exper-
