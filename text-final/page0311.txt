Electrical
Motion

The discovery of electro-
magnetism continued to
provoke a surge of experi-
mentation. The English
physicist Michael Faraday
(1791-1867) set up an elec-
trical circuit that included
two wires and two mag-
nets. In one case, the wire
was fixed and the magnet

 
 
 
  
  
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
  
 
  
  
 
 
  
 
   
   
  

was movable. In the other,
the magnet was fixed and
the wire was movable
When the current passed
through the wire, the mov-
able wire revolved about
the fixed magnet and the
movable magnet revolved
about the fixed wire

In this way, Faraday
demonstrated for the first
time that electrical forces
could produce motion.

This experiment led

Faraday to consider magne-
tism a field that stretched
out from its point of origin
weakening with distance.
One could draw imaginary
lines in the field, connect-
ing all peints of equal mag-
netic intensity, and call
these lines of force. Around
a wire with a current flow-
ing through it, the lines o
for 3
cles, and it was this that
caused the circular move-
ment.

Here began the concep-
tion that today is very
nearly central to physics:
that the Universe consists
of fields, of which particles
are the origin. Lines of
force, first visualized by
Faraday (who had no math-
ematics but who had a ter-
rific grasp of what must be)
are of the utmost impor-
tance to the physics of
today

Seebeck Effect

The German physicist (of
Russian birth) Thomas Jo-
hann Seebeck (1770-1831)
was the first to notice, in
1821, that if two different
al two

 

   

were concentric

   

metals were joine
1d the two points

 

places,
of junction were kept at dif
ferent temperatures

tric current would flow
