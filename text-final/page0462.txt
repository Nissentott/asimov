it. Using this detector,
Branly could detect radio
waves 150 yards from the
source.

The British physicist
Oliver Joseph Lodge (1851-
1940) improved the device
in 1894, called it a coherer,
and used it to detect radio
waves half a mile from the
source. He also sent out the
radio waves in dots and
dashes so that he could

transmit and pick up a mes-
sage in Morse code.

In 1895 two men made
a particularly crucial dis-
covery. They found that a
long vertical wire attached
to the source, and another
attached to the receiver,
made the signals much
stronger and easier to de-
tect. The long wires were
called antennas, because
they seemed to resemble

the long feelers that insects
wear on their heads.

One of the discoverers
was a Russian physicist,
Aleksandr Stepanovich
Popov (1859-1905), the
other an Italian electrical
engineer, Guglielmo Mar-
coni (1874—1937). It was
these antennas that really
made radio communication
possible.

nated a French physicist,
Antoine-Henri Becquerel
(1852—-1908), who had been
working on fluorescent sub-
stances as his father had be-
fore him. He wondered if

perhaps the radiation given
off by fluorescent sub-
stances might include X
rays.

A fluorescent substance
