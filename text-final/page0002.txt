Bipedality

The first human advance
was biological. It consisted
of becoming human.

We might ask what
makes a human being
human. What part is suffi-
ciently Auman so that we
can at once point to it and
say, “This is human. With-
out it, this organism would
be something else.”

The human being of
today has, of course,
evolved many characteris-
tics that are now consid-
ered human, so many that
it is difficult to point to any
one of them and consider it
the key. What we must do,
then, is go back in time,
watching humanity become
more and more primitive,
less human, more apelike.

Yet we must stop at
some point where our an-
cestors are still more nearly
human than they are apish.
Any organism that is more
human than ape is called a
hominid (from a Latin word
for “man’’). Any organism
that is more ape than
human is called a pongid
(from a Congolese word for
“ape”’).

Therefore, we might re-
cast the first sentence of
this section to read “The

first hominid advance was
biological. It consisted of
becoming hominid.”

As we go back in time,
studying the bones and
teeth (all that remain) of
earlier forms of hominid
life, we come to an organ-
ism that was perhaps the
size of a modern chimpan-
zee or even a little smaller
and with a brain that was
no larger. Yet in one crucial
respect, it was much closer
to the human than to the
ape. This human character-
istic is so obvious that, if
we were to see the organ-
ism in real life, we would at
once say, “This is no ape.”

It was the first homi-
nid, and what made it so
was its bipedality. It
walked on two legs, as we
can tell from the shape of
its spinal column, its pelvic
girdle, and its thighbones.

The fact that human be-
ings walk on two legs
strikes us as characteristi-
cally human. We are bipeds
(from Latin words for “two
legs”), while other mam-
mals are quadrupeds (four
legs).

Of course birds walk,
run, or hop on two legs,
and the Greek philosopher
Plato (ca. 427—ca. 347 B.C.)
therefore defined a human

 

being as a “‘featherless
biped.” That is insufficient,
however, for there are bi-
peds with fur (kangaroos
and jerboas) and bipeds
with scales (various dino-
saurs), which Plato knew
nothing about.

Let’s consider bipe-
dality, then, to see what
makes human bipedality
different from other types.

Animals that are bipe-
dal are often restricted to
two legs because two others
have been devoted to some
other (and preferred) form
of locomotion. Most birds
are designed to be flyers,
and the forelegs have be-
come wings for that pur-
pose. Penguins are
swimmers, and the forelegs
have become flippers. In
either case, walking, run-
ning, or hopping is second-
ary.

There are, of course,
nonflying birds like os-
triches, for which walking
or running on two legs is
the only means of locomo-
tion. In such cases, the
body is designed for it and
is essentially horizontal, so
that there are roughly
equal amounts of it at front
and rear. With the two legs
centered, bipedality is a me-
chanically easy thing to
