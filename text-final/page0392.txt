nearly painless, it still re-
mained deadly. The opera-
tion might be successful,
yet the patient might de-
velop inflammation and
die.

In 1865 the British sur-
geon Joseph Lister (1827
1912) learned of Pasteur’s
germ theory of disease (see
1862) and it occurred to
him that death after opera-
tions might result from a
germ infection to which the
traumatized tissues were
particularly susceptible.
The germs producing the in-
fection might come from
the doctors themselves, or
from their instruments.

Lister therefore insti-
tuted the practice of using
phenol solutions to clean
hands and instruments,
and the death rate after op-
erations dropped at once.
Semmelweiss had at-
tempted the same thing sev-
enteen years earlier (see
1847), but without the justi-
fication of Pasteur’s theory,
and physicians refused to
listen. This shows the im-
portance of theory in the
most practical of affairs.

Eventually, chemicals
less irritating and more ef-
fective than phenol were
used, and antiseptic (from
Greek words meaning
“against putrefaction’’) sur-
gery became the rule.

Maxwell’s
Equations

The culminating work of
Maxwell (see 1855) came in
1865 when he began to de-
vise a set of equations (Max-
well's equations), simple in
form, that expressed all the
varied phenomena of elec-
tricity and magnetism and
bound them together indis-
solubly, as Newton had
done for gravitation.
Maxwell showed that

 

electricity and magnetism
did not exist separately,
but that each was an inevi-
table aspect of the other.
There was a single electro-
magnetie force.

Maxwell showed that
the oscillation of an electric
charge produced an electro-
magnetic field that radi-
ated outward from its
source at a constant speed.
This speed could be calcu-
lated from the equations
and turned out to be just
the speed of light. Maxwell
