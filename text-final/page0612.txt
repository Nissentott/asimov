was to come when it would

be a primary weapon in
wars fought in Vietnam
and Afghanistan, to say
nothing of its uses in
tracking traffic, rescue
work, and intra-urban
transportation.

 

Frequency
Modulation

Static in radio broadcasts
was proving a rather intrac-
table problem. Radio trans-
mission for the first forty

years after Marconiâ€™s dis-
covery (see 1901) was car-
ried out by systematically
altering the amplitude (the
height of the wave) of the
carrier signal to match the
variation in the amplitude
of the sound waves being
transmitted. This was
called amplitude modula-
tion, or AM.

Unfortunately, thun-
derstorms and electrical ap-
pliances also modulate the
amplitude, doing it ran-
domly and producing the ir-
ritating noise of static.

In 1939, however, Arm-
strong, who had invented
the superheterodyne re-
ceiver (see 1916), devised a
method of transmitting a
signal by systematically al-
tering the frequency (the
length of the wave) of the
carrier signal. This was
called frequency modula-
tion, or FM. Thunderstorms
and electrical appliances
have no effect on frequency,
so FM transmission is
largely static-free. Unfortu-
nately, FM will work only
for carrier waves of high fre-
quency, and these cannot
be transmitted much be-
yond the horizon.
