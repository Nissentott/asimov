Penicillin

Some discoveries are made
by accident. In 1928 Flem-
ing, who had discovered ly-
sozyme (see 1922), left a
culture of staphylococcus
germs uncovered for some
days. He was through with
it, actually, and was about
to discard the dish con-
taining the culture when he
noticed that some specks of
mold had fallen into it.
Around every speck, the
bacterial colony had dis-
solved away for a short dis-
tance. Bacteria had died
and no new growth had in-
vaded the area.

Fleming isolated the
mold and eventually identi-
fied it as one called Penicil-
lium notatum, closely
related to ordinary bread
mold. He decided that it lib-
erated some compound
that, at the very least, inhib-
ited growth, and he called
the substance penicillin.

Fleming tested the
mold on various types of
bacteria and found that
some were affected and

some were not. Human
cells were not affected. He
did not go further, and it
was to be over a decade be-
fore scientists returned to
the problem. Nevertheless,

for this discovery, Fleming
received a share of the
Nobel Prize for medicine
and physiology in 1945.

Diels-Alder
Reaction

Chemists who specialize in
organic synthesis are de-
lighted when they can find
a chemical reaction that
will put together atoms in
some fashion and that will
work under a variety of con-
ditions.

In 1928 two German
chemists, Otto Paul Her-
mann Diels (1876—1954)
and Kurt Alder (1902—
1958), found a reaction that
would join two compounds
in such a way as to form a
ring of atoms. This was
properly a diene synthesis
but came to be called the
Diels-Alder reaction. The re-
action was useful in synthe-
sizing many compounds of
biological interest, and as a
result, the two chemists
were awarded the Nobel
Prize for chemistry in 1950.

Raman Spectra

After Compton had discov-
ered the Compton effect—
that X rays tended to

lengthen their waves when
diffracted (see 1923)—
Heisenberg (see 1925)
pointed out, in 1925, that
this ought to be true of any
electromagnetic radiation,
including visible light. That
it was so in practice was
shown in 1928 by the In-
dian physicist Chandra-
sekhara Venkata Raman
(1888-1970).

By demonstrating that
scattered light had weak
components of changed
wavelengths, he showed
that photons of visible light
had particle aspects. Fur-
thermore, the exact wave-
lengths produced in the
scattering depended upon
the nature of the molecules
doing the scattering. For
this reason, Raman spectra
proved to be useful in de-
termining some of the fine
details of molecular struc-
ture.

For his discovery,
Raman was awarded the
Nobel Prize for physics in
1930. He was the first Asian
to win a Nobel Prize.

Game Theory

A new branch of mathe-
matics was opened by a
Hungarian-born American
mathematician, John von
