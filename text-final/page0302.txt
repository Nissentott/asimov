Plane of
Polarized Light

Berzelius (see 1803) in 1807
had divided compounds
into organic and inorganic.
Organic compounds were
those obtained from organ-
isms (living or dead) or re-
lated to compounds so
obtained. Those that had
nothing to do with such or-
ganisms were inorganic.

Now Malus's discovery
of polarized light (see 1808)
gained some importance
with a discovery made by
Biot (see 1803). Ordinarily,
the polarized light would
be shining brightly in a cer-
tain plane, so that if two
pieces of Iceland spar were
lined up parallel, the light
would pass undimmed
through both.

If, however, the polar-
ized light, en route from
one piece of Iceland spar to
the other, was made to pass
through some organic lig-
uid, the second piece of Ice-
land spar had to be turned
for the polarized light to
shine brightly again. This
meant that the plane of the
polarized light had twisted

on passing through the or-
ganic liquid. For some lig-
uids, it twisted clockwise,
for others counterclock-
wise.

Biot suggested that this
might be due to some asym-
metry in the structure of
the molecules of the or-
ganic substance. He was
right in this, but there was
as yet no way of determin-
ing what that asymmetry
might be.

Organic
Radicals

Gay-Lussac (see 1804, Sci-
entific Ballooning) worked
carefully with the poison-
ous gas hydrogen cyanide
(HCN). In 1815 he discov-
ered a related poisonous
gas, cyanogen (C:N,).

He went on to show
that the carbon-nitrogen
combination (CN), or the
cyano group, was very sta-
ble. In chemical changes,
the two bound atoms
tended to be transferred as
a unit. Relatively tightly
bound units that main-
tained their integrity
through various chemical

changes came to be called
organic radicals.

This represented a
major step forward in the
understanding of organic
chemistry; that is, the study
of those chemicals and
chemical changes charac-
teristic of organisms.

Proutâ€™s
Hypothesis

Since Dalton had first ad-
vanced his atomic theory
(see 1803), chemists had
been determining the
atomic weights of the chem-
ical elements. Two facts
had already emerged. One
was that the hydrogen
atom seemed the least mas-
sive of the atoms, and the
second was that other
atomic weights seemed to
be even multiples of the
weight of hydrogen.

An English chemist,
William Prout (1785-1850),
therefore suggested in 1815
that hydrogen was the fun-
damental atom and that all
other atoms were built up
of different numbers of hy-
drogen atoms.

This is a classic case of
