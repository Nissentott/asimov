ies in William Shake-
speare’s A Midsummer
Night's Dream, thus break-
ing with the traditional use
of the classical myths.

In 1789 Herschel dis-
covered two more satellites
of Saturn, which were
nearer the planet than the
others were. He named
them Mimas and Encela-
dus, after two giants who
had rebelled against Zeus
(Jupiter) in the Greek
myths. Fourteen satellites
were now known: Earth
had one, Jupiter four, Sa-
turn seven, and Uranus
two. No more were to be
discovered for half a cen-
tury.

Acids

Lavoisier (see 1774) had
named the active portion of
the atmosphere oxygen
(acid-producer) because it
was thought that all acids
contained oxygen.

In 1789, however, the
French chemist Claude-
Louis Berthollet (1748—

1822) showed that hydrocy-
anic acid and hydrosulfuric
acid did not contain oxy-
gen. To be sure, they are
very weak acids, but it was
eventually shown that hy-
drochleric acid, a strong
acid, also did not contain
oxygen.

Conservation of
Mass

Lavoisier in 1789 wrote the
best textbook of chemistry
the world had seen up to
that time.

The most important
generalization he intro-
duced in that book was that
in any closed system (one
from which no mass was al-
lowed to leave, and into
which no mass was allowed
to enter), the total amount
of mass remained the same
no matter what physical or
chemical changes went on.
This is the law of conserva-
tion of mass. For over a cen-
tury it has been central to
chemistry, and when it was

finally modified, it was only
to make it even more funda-
mental.

Uranium

In 1789 Klaproth (see
1784), who was working
with a heavy black ore
called pitchblende, obtained
a yellow compound that
contained a hitherto un-
known element. He thought
it was the element itself,
and he named it after a
planet, after the fashion of
the medieval alchemists.
Since the planet Uranus
had been discovered only
eight years before, Klap-
roth named his new ele-
ment uranium. Neither he
nor anyone else could possi-
bly have foretold the sig-
nificance it would come to
have in the future.

In that same year, Klap-
roth also obtained a new
oxide from the semipre-
cious jewel zircon and
named the new metal con-
tained in the oxide zirco-
nium.
