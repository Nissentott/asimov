true of beta particles. They
came off in a continuous
range of energies, from a
sharply defined maximum
down to zero. This was a
puzzle that was not to be ex-
plained for a number of
years.

Proton

Thomson felt that positive
rays consisted of streams of
high-velocity atomic nuclei
(see 1912). Rutherford stud-
ied them and came to the
conclusion, in 1914, that
the positive rays involving
hydrogen nuclei were the
smallest of all and that no
smaller positively charged
particles existed. He there-
fore called the hydrogen nu-
cleus a proton (from the
Greek word for “first”).

The proton is not the
positive analog of the elec-
tron, however, even though
the size of their electric
charge is precisely the
same. The proton is a much
more massive particle (now
known in fact to be 1836.11
times as massive as the elec-
tron).

After Rutherford had
made his suggestion, it
seemed that the massive nu-
cleus at the center of the
atom must be made up of
protons. (This meant that
Prout’s hypothesis that all
elements were made up of

hydrogen—see 1815—was
in a manner of speaking cor-
rect.)

Of course it didn't
make too much sense that
the atomic nucleus should
consist of protons. After all,
the protons, being posi-
tively charged, would repel
each other. The natural sug-
gestion, then, was that elec-
trons were also present in
the nucleus and that their
negative charges acted as a
kind of cement. This
seemed all the more logical
since radioactive changes
caused atoms to eject elec-
trons in the form of beta
particles, and these seemed
to come from the nucleus.

Furthermore, only in
hydrogen were the mass
and charge of the nucleus
equal. Thus an alpha parti-
cle (a helium nucleus) had
four times the mass of a pro-
ton but a positive charge
only twice that of a proton.
It seemed logical to explain
this by supposing that an
alpha particle consisted of
four protons plus two elec-
trons. The electrons neu-
tralized the charge of two
of the protons without af-
fecting the mass much. The
remaining two positive
charges on the nucleus
were neutralized by the
two planetary electrons cir-
cling outside the nucleus.

It seemed, then, that
all atoms were made up of

equal numbers of protons
and electrons, with some of
the electrons inside the nu-
cleus and some circling
around it.

This picture of the
atom seemed simple and
satisfactory but proved
quite wrong, although the
matter wasn't straightened
out for sixteen years.

Main Sequence

Hertzsprung had noted that
some red stars were giants
and some were dwarfs (see
1905), with nothing in be-
tween. Independently, the
American astronomer
Henry Norris Russell
(1877—-1957) noted this in
1914.

Russell also went into
greater detail. He plotted
the temperatures of stars
against their luminosity
and obtained a diagonal
line that showed that the
stars grew steadily dimmer
as they grew cooler. This
line, which extended from
the hot luminous stars to
the cool dim ones, was
called the Main Sequence,
because about 95 percent of
the stars, including the red
dwarfs, fell upon it. The red
giants did not fall on it, be-
cause although they were
quite cool (that was why
they were red), they were
very luminous, because of
their enormous size.
