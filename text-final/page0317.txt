the temperatures in be-
tween; whether the steam
cools or the water heats
slowly, quickly, smoothly
orin stages.

Carnot was the first to
consider carefully the way
in which heat and work in-
terconvert. For that reason
he is considered the
founder of the science of
thermodynamics (from
Greek words meaning “the
flow of heat”). From his
work it was possible to de-
duce what came to be
called the second law of ther-
modynamics a quarter-cen-
tury later.

Distance of
the Sun

A century and a half before,
Cassini, making use of the
parallax of Mars, had esti-
mated the distance of

the Sun from Earth as
87,000,000 miles (see 1672).

In 1824 Encke (see
1818), using the time that
Venus entered the Sun's
disk and left it during its
transits, announced the
Sun to be 95,300,000 miles
from Earth. This was better
than Cassini’s figure had
been. Encke's figure was
only 2.6 percent too high.

 

Quintic
Equations

General solutions by alge-
braic methods had been
found for the equations of
the third degree (cubic
equations) and the fourth
degree (quartic equations)
—see 1535 and 1545. Ever
since, mathematicians had
been struggling to find a
general solution for equa-
tions of the fifth degree

 

, those

(quintic equations
that involved an x*,

They had failed, and in
1824 the Norwegian mathe-

matician Niels Henrik Abel
(1802—-1829) was able to
demonstrate that a general
algebraic solution of the
quintic equation was im-
possible. Just as Gauss had
shown impossibility in ge-
ometry (see 1796), so Abel
was able to show impossi
bility in algebra

Silicon

Silicon, as chemists now
know, is, next to oxygen,
the most common element
in the Earth's crust. It is a
component of most rocks,
of sand, of glass. Neverthe-
less, it holds on to other
atoms so tightly that it is
not easy to isolate. Berze-
lius (see 1803) was able to
manage it, however, and in
1824 was the first to obtain
elementary silicon.
