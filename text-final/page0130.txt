lished posthumously in
1556. In it he summarized
all the practical knowledge
he had gained from Ger-
man miners. It was clearly
written and had excellent il-
lustrations of mining ma-
chinery. It was the first
important book on miner-
als ever written and is usu-
ally considered to have
founded the science of min-
eralogy.

Tobacco

Native Americans were
quite willing to teach Euro-
pean arrivals the mysteries

of tobacco—how to prepare
the leaves, burn them, and
inhale the smoke. They
probably didn't intend this
as revenge for being en-
slaved and killed, but it
worked out that way. To-
bacco addiction settled
down on Europe and even-
tually on the rest of the
world. There is no estimate
of how much discomfort it
has caused in the way of
stench, how much natural
and property damage it has
caused in the way of forest
fires and building fires, and
how many people (smokers
and nonsmokers alike) it

has killed in those fires or
through lung cancer and
heart disease.

The first tobacco seeds
reached Spain in 1556.

A French diplomat,
Jean Nicot (ca. 1530—1600),
served as ambassador to
Portugal between 1559 and
1561 and sent tobacco
seeds to France. His name
is immortalized in nicotine,
the name of the highly poi-
sonous substance that is
the active ingredient in to-
bacco. An English naval
commander, John Hawkins
(1532—1595), introduced it
to England in 1565.

Scientific
Societies

Throughout history, scien-
tists have usually worked
alone because of the diffi-
culty of communication.
Sometimes they gathered
in some particular center of
learning, as in Athens, Alex-

andria, and Baghdad, but
even then their companion-
ship was a haphazard
thing.

The coming of printing
made it easier to record
and publish advances, how-
ever, and the affair of Tar-
taglia and Cardano (see
1535) made it important to
publish if one wanted

credit. There would be
value in exchanging infor-
mation, then, for it would
benefit all scientists in their
search for reputation.

In 1560 an Italian phys-
icist, Giambattista della
Porta (1535?-1615),
founded the first scientific
association designed partic-
ularly for this interchange
