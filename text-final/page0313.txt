but these were equipped to
do only the very simplest
tasks.

About 1822 an English
mathematician, Charles
Babbage (1792-1871),
began thinking of some-
thing much, much more
ambitious. He wanted a ma-
chine that could be di-
rected to work by means of
punched cards as in a Jac-
quard loom (see 1801), that
could store partial answers
in order to save them for ad-
ditional operations to be
performed upon them later,
and that could print the re-
sults.

Everything he thought
of could be done, but not by
purely mechanical means,
using the techniques of Bab-
bage’s time. He spent virtu-
ally the rest of his life
trying to build the ma-
chine, his plans growing
ever more grandiose.

Babbage had conceived
the modern computer, but
he didn’t have the neces-
sary electronic switches.
These were not to be devel-
oped for another century.

Projective
Geometry

The French mathematician
Jean-Victor Poncelet (1788~
1867) was taken prisoner

during Napoléon's invasion
of Russia, and during the
year and a half he spent in
Russia, he meditated on ge-
ometry. The fruits ap-
peared in 1822, when he
published a book on projec-
tive geometry (roughly, the
study of the shadows cast
by geometric figures). Pre-
viously knotty problems
yielded easily to the new
technique. The book is usu-
ally considered to be the
foundation of modern ge-
ometry.

Iguanodon

In 1822 an English geolo-
gist, Gideon Algernon Man-
tell (1790-1852), uncovered
the bones and teeth of a
large animal and sent some
of them to Cuvier (see
1798). For once Cuvier
made a mistake and
thought the teeth were
those of a rhinoceroslike
mammal.

A couple of years later,
Mantell came across the
teeth of an iguana, a reptile
that lives in desert areas of
North America. The fossil
teeth he had found were
precisely like those of the
iguana but much larger.
Mantell realized then that
he had uncovered an an-
cient reptile and named it
iguanodon (from the

Greek meaning “iguana-
tooth").

As it turned out, he was
the first to discover an ex-
ample of what were eventu-
ally to be called dinosaurs
(from Greek words mean-
ing “terrifying lizards”). Di-
nosaurs proved to be by far
the most dramatic relics of
past ages and did more to
acquaint the ordinary per-
son with the fact of biologi-
cal evolution than anything
else.

Hieroglyphics

Even with the Rosetta
Stone (see 1799), nearly a
quarter-century passed be-
fore important progress
was made in deciphering
ancient Egyptian hiero-
glyphic writing. The first
person to make any prog-
ress at all was Young (see
1801, Light Waves).

It was not till 1822,
however, that a true deci-
pherment was made, by a
French linguist, Jean-Fran-
¢ois Champollion (1790—
1832), who realized that
some signs were alpha-
betic, some syllabic, and
some represented a whole
word or idea. It was he who
founded modern Egyptol-
ogy-
