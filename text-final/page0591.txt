Cherenkov
Radiation

Light travels at a speed of
299,792 5 kilometers per
second (186,282 miles per
second), and nothing can go
faster than that according
to special relativity (see
1905). However, light trav-
els more slowly when pass-
ing through matter, and the
decrease in speed is more
marked as the index of re-
fraction of the transparent
medium increases. In
water, light travels at
224,900 kilometers per sec-
ond, and only 124,000 kilo-
meters per second in
diamond. The speed of light
is even a bit below maxi-
mum when it is passing
through air.

A rapidly moving parti-
cle can never travel faster
than the speed of light in a
vacuum, but it can travel
faster than light does in
water, let us say. And if the
particle is moving ex-
tremely close to the speed
of light in a vacuum, it may
move faster in air than
light does. When particles
move faster than light in
some medium other than a
vacuum, they leave a wake
of light trailing behind.

A Soviet physicist,
Pavel Alekseyevich Cheren-
kov (b. 1904), was the first
to observe this wake of radi-
ation, which came to be
called Cherenkov radiation
as a result. The reason for
the wake was explained by
the Russian physicists Igor
Yevgenyevich Tamm
(1895-1971) and Ilya Mik-
haylovich Frank (b. 1908).

From the angle at
which Cherenkov radiation
is emitted, the speed of ul-
trafast particles can be cal-
culated, and for this
finding, Cherenkov, Tamm,
and Frank were awarded
the Nobel Prize for physics
in 1958.

Supernovas

Tycho Brahe had observed
a very bright nova (see
1572) and so had Kepler in
1604. Since then, three and
a quarter centuries had
passed without such a
bright nova being seen. To
be sure, from time to time
new stars had been seen
that were fairly bright and
that qualified as novas, but
none had attained a bright-
ness surpassing that of Jupi-
ter, or even Venus, as the
novas of Tycho and Kepler
had.

In 1885 a nova had ap-
peared in the Andromeda
nebula that had attained a
brightness of magnitude 7,
almost bright enough to see

with the unaided eye, but
this had not been made
much of at the time. When
Hubble, however, showed
that the Andromeda nebula
was really a far distant gal-
axy (see 1923), the bright-
ness of the 1885 nova had
to be reassessed. To be
nearly visible to the un-
aided eye from the vast dis-
tance of the Andromeda
galaxy, it had to be enor-
mously more luminous
than the run-of-the-mill
novas that had been seen
since Kepler's time.

The Swiss astronomer
Fritz Zwicky (1898-1974)
pointed this out in 1934
and suggested that novas
such as those Tycho and
Kepler had seen and the
one in the Andromeda gal-
axy were supernovas. Since
Kepler's time, none had
been seen in our own gal-
axy, but Zwicky, watching
other galaxies, spotted a
number. Since a supernova
shines at its peak with a
brilliance about equal to
the total light of an average
galaxy, a supernova can be
seen as far as a galaxy can.

Neutron Stars

It seemed reasonable that
when a star used up its nu-
clear fuel, its center would
cool down. Without fierce
central heat to keep its
huge body bloated, it might
collapse to a white dwarf
