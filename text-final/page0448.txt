He built up a system begin-

successor, and developed
them symbolically into the
arithmetic on which all
mathematics is based.

Energy of
Activation

It was the experience of
early humans that fires
were hard to start but that
once started, they kept
right on going with no fur-
ther trouble as long as they
were fed fuel.

This is also true of
many chemical reactions.
Nevertheless, a reaction
that ordinarily yields en-
ergy when it proceeds will
not take place spontane-
ously until energy is added
to it. The reaction has to be
activated, by breaking mole-
cules apart, perhaps, so
that individual atoms or
molecular fragments can
react with each other more
freely. The energy required
is called the energy of activa-
tion.

Once the reaction
starts, it yields energy that
can be used to activate
neighboring parts of the ini-
tial substance. Thus, when
you heat a hydrogen and ox-
yeen mixture and a small
amount begins to react, the

energy it produces will
cause a wave of reaction to
spread to other parts of the
mixture so rapidly that it
explodes. This is a chain re-
action, since each step
leads to the next, as each
link in a chain leads to the
next.

Arrhenius (see 1884) an-
alyzed the energy activa-
tion concept systematically
in 1889 and brought about
new understanding of
chemical reactions, of
chain reactions, and of ex-
plosions.

Spectroscopic
Binaries

Binary stars had been
known since Herschel had
discovered them nearly a
century before (see 1781).
However, they could be de-
tected optically only if they
were far enough apart to be
seen as separate objects in
a telescope. What if the
pair were so far away or so
close together (or both) that
they could not be distin-
guished?

In 1889 the American
astronomer Edward
Charles Pickering (1846~
1919) noted that Mizar, the
middle star in the handle of
the Big Dipper, had dark
lines that divided in two.
They moved apart, then
came together, joined, and
moved apart again in the
opposite direction. He sus-

pected that what he was
viewing was a binary star
with components so close
together they could not be
seen separately.

However, as they cir-
cled each other in the plane
of his line of sight, one was
advancing and the other re-
ceding, so that the former
showed a violet shift and
the latter a red shift. After
they had swung about each
other, the one that was re-
ceding began to advance
and vice versa.

His assistant, Antonia
Caetana Maury (1866—
1952), worked out the pe-
riod of this spectroscopic bi-
nary—104 days—and then
went on to discover a sec-
ond such star, Beta Auri-
gae, with a period of 4 days.

The following year, a
German astronomer, Her-
mann Karl Vogel (1842—
1907), independently dis-
covered spectroscopic bina-
ries.

Mercury’s
Rotation

Schiaparelli, who had been
the first to see the markings
on Mars that were interpre-
ted as canals (see 1877),
went on to study the mark-
ings on Mercury. Mercury
was a smaller world than
Mars and farther away. It
was often lost in the Sun's
glare, and when it could be
seen best, only a crescent
