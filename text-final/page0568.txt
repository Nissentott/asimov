Neumann (1903-1957), in
1928. He began devising
the principles of what came
to be called game rheory be-
cause it dealt with the best
strategies to follow when
playing simple games with
fixed rules, such as coin-
matching.

The principles so devel-
oped could then be applied
to far more complicated
games, such as business or
war, and an attempt made
to work out the best strat-
egy to beat a competitor or
an enemy. Even scientific
research can be considered
a game, one in which scien-
tists pit their wits against
the impersonal Universe.

Hexuronic Acid

In 1928 the Hungarian-
born American biochemist
Albert von Nagyrapolt
Szent-Gyorgyi (1893-1986),
while working at Cam-
bridge University under
Hopkins (see 1900, Trypto-
phan), isolated a substance
from adrenal glands that
casily lost and regained a
pair of hydrogen atoms and
was therefore, like glutathi-
one (see 1921), a hydrogen
carrier.

Since its molecules
seemed to have six carbon
atoms and since it had the
properties of a sugar,
Szent-Gyorgyi named it

hexuronic acid. (The hex is
from the Greek word for
â€œsix"" and the uronic is a
common suffix for sugar-
related compounds.)

Szent-Gyorgyi also iso-
lated the substance from
cabbages and oranges, both
rich in vitamin C, but it
took him a while to decide
that hexuronic acid was it-
self the vitamin.
