synthetic rubber that could
be made at home.

One of those involved
in the search was a
Belgian-born American
chemist, Julius Arthur
Nieuwland (1878—1936).
His researches uncovered
the fact that acetylene, a
compound with a molecule
made up of two carbon’
atoms and two hydrogen
atoms, could polymerize;
that is, add other atoms
onto itself to form a long
chain of atoms. At some
stage, this chain gained
some of the properties of
rubber.

Nieuwland found that
if, at the four-carbon stage,
chlorine atoms were
attached, the resulting
chain was far more like rub-
ber. By 1931 he had what
was called neoprene. This
kept essential facets of the
American economy rolling
later when the rubber sup-
ply was indeed cut off.

Nylon

One of the most important
natural polymers is silk,
which is a protein fiber
composed of a long string
of relatively simple amino
acids. Making silk from
the cocoon of the silkworm
(a caterpillar) is a tedious
job.

It occurred to the Amer-

ican chemist Wallace
Hume Carothers (1896—
1937) that an artificial poly-
mer might be prepared that
had the properties of silk.
He had worked on poly-
mers along with Nieuwland
and had helped synthesize
neoprene (see above).

Carothers began work-
ing with compounds called
diamines and dicarboxylic
acids. These combine alter-
nately to form the same
types of connections that
amino acids do. In 1931
Carothers found a poly-
meric fiber that, after
stretching, proved even
stronger than silk. It was
eventually called nylon,
and the time was to come
when it would replace silk
to a very large extent.

Virus Particles

Since the existence of vi-
ruses had first been demon-
strated by Beijerinck (see
1898), some forty diseases
(including measles,
mumps, chickenpox, influ-
enza, smallpox, poliomyeli-
tis, rabies, and the common
cold) had been found to

be caused by viruses, but
their nature remained a
mystery.

In 1931, an English bac-
teriologist, William Joseph
Elford (1900-1952), man-
aged to trap some in filters.
He used fine collodion

membranes, graded to keep
out smaller and smaller
particles. From the fineness
of the membrane that could
filter out the agents capable
of producing a given dis-
ease, he could judge the
size of that particular virus.
He found that viruses
were smaller than even the
smallest bacteria, but that
even the smallest viruses
were larger than most mole-
cules. Viruses, in other
words, were objects that
ranged in size from that
of large protein molecules
to nearly that of tiny
bacteria.

Virus Culture

A great deal of the success
in dealing with bacterial
disease came about because
it was possible to grow
pure colonies of bacteria in
glassware and study them
in detail. Virus diseases pre-
sented a more intricate puz-
zle, because viruses would
only multiply inside living
cells.

In 1931, however, the
American pathologist Er-
nest William Goodpasture
(1886—1960) devised a tech-
nique for culturing viruses
in eggs, which are, after all,
living cells. This technique
made it possible eventually
to develop vaccines for a
number of viral diseases,
notably poliomyelitis.
