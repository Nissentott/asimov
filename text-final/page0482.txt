1883). To his surprise, Ri-
chet discovered that if he
caused an animal to pro-
duce an immune serum to a
particular foreign protein
(an antigen) and then in-
jected the antigen, the ani-
mal died. In 1902 Richet
named this phenomenon
anaphylaxis, from Greek
words meaning "“overpro-
tection.”

From then on, physi-
cians were warned. Serum
therapy had to be con-
ducted in such a way as to
prevent the possibility of
sensitization, which would
produce serum sickness. It
came to be understood that
people might be sensitized
to foreign proteins in the en-
vironment—in plant pol-
len, in dust, in food—and
exhibit unpleasant reac-
tions. These reactions came
to be called allergies (from
Greek words meaning
“other work,” because the
mechanisms of the body do
something other than the
work they are supposed to
do).

Richet's work on ana-
phylaxis, and the under-
standing of allergies that it
led to, brought him the
Nobel Prize in medicine
and physiology in 1913.

Sutures

The French surgeon Alexis
Carrel (1873—1944) was par-
ticularly deft in the field of

blood-vessel repair. He de-
veloped a technique by
which blood vessels could
be delicately sutured (sewn
together) end toend. He
did this successfully in
1902, requiring as few as
three stitches for the job.
The usefulness of such
techniques in surgery led to
Carrel’s being awarded the
Nobel Prize in medicine
and physiology in 1912.

Radioactive
Series

Crooke's discovery that
much of uranium’s radioac-
tivity could be precipitated
and that the radicactivity
would spontaneously re-
turn thereafter (see 1900)
led Rutherford and an assis-
tant, the English chemist
Frederick Soddy (1877—
1956), to investigate the
matter more thoroughly.
By subjecting uranium and
thorium to chemical manip-
ulations and following the
fate of the radioactivity,
they demonstrated that the
two elements broke down
in the course of radioactiv-
ity into a series of interme-
diate elements.

This meant that one
could speak of a radioactive
series.

Photoelectric
Effect and
Electrons

Hertz had first noted the
photoelectric effect—the
greater ease which which
electric sparks cross small
gaps when ultraviolet light
falls upon those gaps—four-
teen years before (see 1887).
Now that electrons were
known, the photoelectric ef-
fect could be studied more
effectively.

Lenard (see 1895)
showed in 1902 that the
electrical effects produced
by light falling upon cer-
tain metals were the result
of electrons being emitted
from the metal surface. He
showed that only light of a
certain wavelength or
shorter could bring about
electron emission from a
particular metal, and that
the crucial wavelength was
different for different met-
als.

Increasing intensity of
light of a given wavelength
resulted in the emission of
a greater number of elec-
trons, but the energy of the
individual electrons re-
mained the same. If the
wavelength decreased, the
electrons emitted had
higher energy; if the wave-
length increased, the elec-
trons emitted had lower
energies. There was no way
of explaining this by nine-
teenth-century physics.
