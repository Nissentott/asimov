speaking a language? You
could then build up any
words of any language by
using those sound-symbols
Sound-symbols had, in fact,
been used by the Egyp-
tians, but they also pre-
served symbols for
syllables and for whole
words. The Canaanite in-
ventor had the notion that
the sound-symbols should
be used exclusively and that
words should be built up
out of them.

Monotheism

It is customary for people
to believe in a multitude of
separate supernatural in-
fluences, Every object—the
Sun, the Moon, trees, ani-
mals, even abstractions
such as tribes and nations
—must have its supernatu-
ral accompaniment, cause,
or protector.

The first person we
know of to suppose that
there was only one divine
influence that controlled ev-

 

 

The first two symbols
of this collection were aleph
(the usual symbol for an ox)
and beth (the usual symbol
for a house). To the Greeks,
who eventually adopted the
system, these became alpha
and beta, and we still call
the system of symbols the
alphabet.

The Phoenician alpha-
bet, which first came into
use about 1500 B.c., revolu-
tionized writing, making it
far easier to write and to
read, so that the chances of

pharach named Amenhotep
IV, who reigned over Egypt
from 1379 to 1362 B.c. He
accepted the Sun-god as
the one and only god, and
this makes some sense,
since the Sun is an overrid-
ing influence on Earth and
on humanity. The Sun-god
was, to him, Aton, and he
called himself Akhenaton,
meaning “Aton is satis-
fied.” His seventeen-year
reign was a failure, how-
ever, because his views

literacy were increased.
This is one invention that
seems to have oceurred
only once in human his-
tory. The alphabet was not
invented independently by
any other society. All alpha-
bets in use today (including
the one in which this beok
is written and printed) are
descended from that first
Phoenician one.

priesthood or by the Egyp-
tian people, who clung to
their old ways.

It is possible, however,
that the Akhenatonic tradi-
tion lingered among a few
and influenced Moses, the
legendary leader who
brought the Israelite slaves
out of Egypt, according to
the Bible, about a century
and a half after Akhena-
ton's time. (The later Jews
attributed monotheism to
the legendary Abraham,
