as modifying defective
genes to make them nor-
mal, thus holding out the
hope that genetic defects
might someday be cured. It
also offered the possibility
of something as far-reach-
ing as the ability to direct
human evolution (with all
the treacherous side effects
that might involve).

Proton Decay

Since the successful unifi-
cation of the electromag-
netic and weak interactions
(see 1968), physicists such
as Glashow had been at-
tempting to include the
strong interaction as well
under the umbrella of a sin-
gle set of equations. This

was being done, though it
required several sets of mod-
ifications to make such a
Grand Unified Theory (GUT)
work, and it is still not en-
tirely satisfactory today.

In 1973 Abdus Salam
suggested that such a the-
ory might imply that the
proton was very slightly un-
stable.
