Law of Mass
Action

Chemists found that chemi-
cal reactions could often
proceed in either of two di

rections. By increasing the

 

mass of one set of reagents,
the reaction could be forced
to move in the direction
that consumed that set.
The Norwegian chem-
ists Cato Maximilian Guld-
berg (1836—1902) and his
brother-in-law, Peter
Waage (1833—1900),
showed that it was not
mass alone that did this
but concentration; that is,
the quantity of mass in a
given volume. The rule,
known as the law of mass
action, was promulgated in
1867 and helped lead the
way toward the application
of thermodynamics to
chemical reactions
