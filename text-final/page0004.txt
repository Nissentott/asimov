the Earth had been warm
for quite a while, and large
tropical animals, such as el-
ephants, rhinoceroses, and
hippopotamuses, tended to
lose their hair because such
insulation kept them too
warm. For some reason, the
hominids also lost their
hair though they were
much smaller than other
hairless mammals. We
donâ€™t know at what stage
hair was lost.

The Earth of the austra-
lopithecines was turning
cooler, however. The forests
shrank and were replaced
by grasslands. Those organ-
isms whose habitat was the
forest and who did not give
up the trees naturally re-
treated with the forest.

Some arboreal prehom-
inids managed to adapt to
the grasslands in east-cen-
tral Africa and to spend
more and more time out of
the trees. It must have been
a difficult transition. As
they spent more time on

 

the ground, they had an in-
creasing tendency to rise to
their hind legs and peer
about over the tall grass,
searching for food or watch-
ing out for predators. Those
who could stand upright
more easily and could do so
for longer intervals were
better able to survive.

Even a slight crook in
the spine, which made
standing upright slightly
easier, gave those who had
it a better chance of surviv-
ing, and of having children
to inherit that crook. What
we call natural selection
would thus drive the pre-
hominids toward bipe-
dality and a true hominid
character.

Bipedality had side ef-
fects that were also benefi-
cial and that reinforced the
natural-selection drive. The
forelimbs were freed for
duty as something other
than support. The freed
hands could more easily
manipulate portions of the
environment, feel them,

and bring them close to the
eyes, ears, and nose, so that
the brain was continually
flooded with sensations.

Any change that made
the brain a bit larger or
more complex made it pos-
sible for the brain to handle
the flood of sensation more
efficiently, and this led to
an improved chance of sur-
vival. Thus, natural selec-
tion introduced a drive for
bigger and better brains.

The early australopith-
ecines, with a brain as large
as that of a chimpanzee but
with a body that was
slighter, already had a
larger brain-to-body ratio
than any pongid then or
since. Since the brain-to-
body ratio is a crucial fac-
tor in what we call intelli-
gence (provided the brain is
reasonably large), the aus-
tralopithecines were proba-
bly the most intelligent
land animals existing in
their time.

 

Stone Tools

Sometimes, we think of the
human being as a tool-
using animal. Tool-using is
not really unique to human
beings, however. For exam-

ple, sea otters routinely
smash shellfish against a
rock they carry for the pur-
pose on their abdomens as
they float belly-up. A long
litany of other examples
could also be given.

If we change that to
tool-making animal, we are
somewhat better off, but
not entirely. Chimpanzees
have been seen to strip
leaves from twigs and then
use the bare twigs as de-
