The outside part, which
wraps about the medulla, is
the cortex (from a Latin
word for "'bark”). It too
manufactures hormones.

The American biochem-
ist Edward Calvin Kendall
(1886—1972) isolated no
fewer than twenty-eight dif-
ferent cortical hormones, or
corticoids, of which four
showed effects on labora-
tory animals. He named the
corticoids by letter, and the
four effective ones were
Compound A, Compound B,
Compound E, and Com-
pound F.

Of these, Compound E,
which Kendall isolated in
1935, proved the most use-
ful. It came to be called cor-
tisone and was widely used
as an anti-inflammatory
drug.

For his work on corti-
coids, Kendall was
awarded a share of the
Nobel Prize for medicine
and physiology in 1950.

Prostaglandins

In 1935 the Swedish physi-
ologist Ulf Svante Von
Euler (1905—-1983) isolated
a hormonelike substance
from semen, which he took
to represent a product of
the prostate acting as a
gland. He therefore called
it prostaglandin.
Prostaglandin and re-
lated compounds referred
to collectively as the prosta-
glandins have since been

found in other tissues and
have proved to have a wide
variety of physiologic ef-
fects on the body.

Radar

To send out a beam of light
and record the time it took
to be reflected back across
a given distance had first
been used to determine the
speed of light by Fizeau (see
1849). Once the speed of

light was determined with
good accuracy, the time it
took for a beam of light to
strike an object and return
could be made to yield both
the direction and the dis-
tance of the reflecting ob-
ject. Such a scheme,
making use of ultrasonic
sound, had been used by
Langevin in devising sonar
(see 1917).

The use of light for
such a purpose is impracti-
