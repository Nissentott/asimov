let light from the Sun,
which is dangerous to life,

the Earth’s surface.

Vitamins A
and B

As research on vitamins
continued, it became clear
that there were several of
them. The American bio-
chemist Elmer Verner
McCollum (1879-1967)
found, in 1913, that there
was some factor essential
to life in some fats. It had
to be fat-soluble, and this
alone had to make its mo-
lecular structure consider-
ably different from the
trace substance, essential
to life, that cured beri-
beri, since that was water-
soluble.

In the absence of any
real information about the
molecular structure of
these compounds, McCol-
lum called them fat-soluble
A and water-soluble B. Even-
tually, this was changed to
vitamin A and vitamin B.

The use of letters has
persisted, at least to some
extent, ever since. For in-
stance, the factor that Lind
had unwittingly werked
with in curing scurvy (see
1747) came to be called vita-
min C and the one that pre-
vented rickets was called
vitamin D.

Michaelis-
Menten
Equation

Although catalysts had
been known and used for a
century (even if we don’t
count the prehistoric use of
fermentation), the manner
of their action remained
unknown. In fact there
seemed something almost
magical about them. How
could they hasten a chemi-
cal reaction and yet not
take part in it themselves?
How could enzymes, pres-
ent in so small a quantity
that no chemist knew what
their molecular structure
might be, so greatly hasten
areaction?

The German chemist
Leonor Michaelis (1875—
1949) and his assistant
Maud Lenora Menten de-
rived an equation that
would deseribe the rate at
which enzyme-catalyzed re-
actions took place. In order
to do that, they supposed
that the enzyme combined
with the substance whose
reaction it catalyzed and
that after the reaction took
place the two separated
again.

This supposition al-
lowed the Michaelis-Menten
equation to be derived,
which showed how the rate
of reaction varied with the
concentration of the sub-

stance undergoing the reac-
tion. It seemed that
enzymes and catalysts gen-
erally did take part in the
reaction. The enzyme (or
the catalyst, more usually)
offered a surface to which
the reactant could attach
under circumstances that
allowed it to undergo the re-
action much more readily.
To be metaphorical,
the catalyst played the part
of a hard flat surface in the
writing of a note. It is diffi-
cult to write on a piece of
paper in the air, but place
the paper on a desk and
writing is easy. The desk
takes no part in the writ-
ing, but it does offer an ap-
propriate surface. Catalysts
began to lose their mystery.

o
Glycolysis

The British physiologist Ar-
chibald Vivian Hill (1886—
1977) was particularly in-
terested in the relationship
between muscle contrac-
tion and heat development.
To measure the small and
transient heat effects, he
made use of thermocouples,
which swiftly and deli-
cately recorded heat
changes in the form of tiny
electric currents. He refined
his methods till he could
measure a rise of three-
thousandths of a degree for
a few hundredths of a sec-
ond.
