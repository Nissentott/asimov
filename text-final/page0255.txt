Do other planets have
similar characteristics?
Herschel (see Binary Stars,
above) was studying the ro-
tation of Marsâ€”the man-
ner in which its markings
moved about it, which Cas-
sini had used to determine
the length of the Martian
day (see 1665). It seemed to
Herschel that the markings
had to move parallel to the
Martian equator and that
its axis of rotation would
have to be perpendicular to
that. By determining the
axis of rotation in this way,
Herschel calculated that
Mars had an axial inclina-
tion of just about 24 de-
grees, nearly that of
Earth's. This was one more
way in which Earth resem-
bled other planets.

Steam Engine

Since Watt had thought of
having a hot and a cold
chamber in a steam engine

(see 1764), he kept introduc-
ing improvements. He ar-
ranged to have the steam
push into a chamber on
each side of the piston alter-
nately so that it would be
pushed rapidly in both di-
rections rather than in only
one.

In 1781 he devised me-
chanical attachments that
ingeniously converted the
back-and-forth movement
of a piston into the rotary
movement of a wheel, so
that the steam engine could
be made to power a variety
of activities and machines.

The now-versatile
steam engine was the first
of the modern prime mov-
ers, the first modern device,
that is, that could take en-
ergy as it occurred in na-
ture and apply it to the
driving of machinery. To be
sure, wind and running
water were the prime mov-
ers of ancient times, but
wind is erratic, and run-

ning water only exists in
certain places, The use of
fuel is certain; it ahways con-

 

tains energy. What's more,
it can be used anywhere
and in any quantity within
reason.

The steam engine,
bringing the use of ener
to all mechanical devic
far greater quantity than
anything else had offered in
the past was the key to all
that followed rapidly under
the name of the Industrial
Revolution, when the face of
the world was changed as
drastically (and far more
rapidly) than at any time
since the invention of agri-
culture, nearly ten thou-
sand years before (see
8000 B.C.).
