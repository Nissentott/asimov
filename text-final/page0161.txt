in the margin to write it
down.

Now Fermat often said
he had a proof for some par-
ticular proposition, and in
every case, proofs have

been overed for thosc
cases even when Fermat
didn't give his. In y

Coke

England’s forests were di-
minishing, and for that rea-
son the English were
turning to coal for fuel,
even though its fumes and
smoke were neither appetiz-
ing nor healthy

Wood was still needed
for charcoal, however (sec
1000 B.c.), which was used

in iron-smelting. Coal could
substitute for wood in heat
ing homes but could not
substitute for charcoval in
industry

If coal is subjected to

  

the same kind of incom-
plete burning as wood, how
ever, coal like wood will
burn ofl the noncarbon ms:
terial leaving virtually pure

carbon behind. The pure-

 

carbon residue of coal is
called coke (a word of un-

known derivation). It may

 

have

Coke is very like ch
coal and b the promisc
ol being uselul in i
smelting, once the proper

hnique had been devi
