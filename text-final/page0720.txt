getic as Earth's, made itself
felt at a distance of
4,300,000 miles from the
planet.

From the data obtained
by the probe, it was possi-
ble to build a picture of the
planet’s structure, It would
seem that Jupiter is a ball
of hot liquid hydrogen
mixed with some helium (a
constitution much like that
of the Sun).

The temperature rises
rapidly with distance be-
neath the visible cloud sur-
face. At 600 miles below, it
is already 3,600° C; at 1,800
miles below, it is 10,000° C;
at 15,000 miles below, it is
20,000° C; and at the very
center of Jupiter, it is
54,000° C. Below 15,000
miles, hydrogen takes on a
metallic form.

Pioneer 10 carried a
message from Earth etched
into a 6- by 9-inch gold-
plated aluminum slab. It
showed a man and woman
next to an outline of Pioneer
10 drawn to scale. Also
included were details of
the Solar System and its
location in the Universe
relative to distant
quasars.

Skylab

The first American orbiting
object that might be consid-
ered a space station was
Skylab. 1t was 118 feet long
and was launched into

orbit on May 14, 1973,
about 270 miles above
Earth’s surface. On May 25,
three astronauts were car-
ried to Skylab and re-
mained on it for twenty-
eight days. A second crew
remained for sixty days,
and a third for eighty-four
days. Surveys were taken of
Earth's mineral resources
and its crops and forests.
Photographs of the Sun
were also taken.

Origin of the
Universe

Scientists had come to ac-
cept the big bang as the
manner in which the Uni-
verse had come into being,
but that left one crucial
question unanswered.
Granted that all the matter
in the Universe was origi-
nally compressed into a
comparatively tiny body
that expanded into the pres-
ent Universe, where did
that originally tiny body
come from?

In 1973 the American
physicist Edward P. Tryon
pointed out that what we
ordinarily think of as a vac-
uum is not truly a vacuum.
It can give rise to sub-
atomie particles that disap-
pear before they can be
detected, in accordance
with quantum mechanics
and the uncertainty princi-
ple.

He suggested that if we
start with an infinite sea of
nothingness, particles will
appear and disappear.
Every once in a while, a par-
ticle may appear that can
devlop the mass of the Uni-
verse and begin to expand
before it can disappear. The
Universe may therefore be
a random quantum fluctua-
tion in a vacuum, so that it
originated out of nothing.

The implications and
the detailed development of
such a universe have been
argued over by astrono-
mers ever since.

Genetic
Engineering

It is one thing to under-
stand the fundamental
chemistry of the DNA mole-
cules that make up the
genes; it is another to be
able to modify that chemis-
try. In 1973 two American
biochemists, Stanley H.
Cohen and Herbert W.
Boyer, showed that when
DNA was broken into frag-
ments and these were com-
bined into new genes (see
1970), the new genes could
be inserted into bacterial
cells, where they could be
reproduced whenever the
cells divided in two.

This was the beginning
of genetic engineering. 1t of-
fered a technique for some-
thing as simple and useful
