Lever

Levers were used in prehis-
toric times. It is no great
trick for a lively mind to
try to pry up a rock with a
long stick and to find that it
works better if another,
smaller rock is placed
under the stick to give the
stick something to push
against. It would then
quickly be discovered that
the closer the small rock is to
the big rock being pried up,
the easier the prying gets.

Nevertheless, the pre-
cise mathematics of lever
action was not worked out
until the Greek scientist Ar-
chimedes (ca. 287-212 B.c.)
did it about 260 B.c.

You might say, “Whal
difference does it make that
scholars worked out lancy
theories and mathematics
for levers, when practical
people had been actually

using such devices for thou-
sands of years?"

The point is that use
without theory is largely
hit and miss. Advances are
made, yes, but slowly. Once
a useful theory is worked
out, however, it is like re-
moving a blindfold. It be-
comes obvious how a
device might be improved,
or what new observations
need to be made. With a
theory, advances speed up
enormously.

Therefore we give Ar-
chimedes credit for the
principle of the lever, re-
gardless of how long the
lever had been in use before
his time.

Archimedes also
worked oul the principle of
buoyancy, the manner in
which any object immersed
in a fluid displaces a vol-
ume of fluid equal 1o its
own volume. This provided

a way of measuring vol-
ume, a way of explaining
why some things (loat and
some don't, and so on. Ar-
chimedes grasped the prin-
ciple quite suddenly when
he lowered himself into a
public bath and noticed the
water overflow.

The storv is that he
sprang out of the bath and
raced home nude, shouting
“Eureka! Eureka!” (“I have
it! [ have it!"). He had been
given the problem of check-
ing whether a golden crown
was adulterated with a less
dense metal or not, without
damaging the crown. For
that he had 1o know the val-
ume, and the buovaney el-
fect would give it to him.
(The ancient Greeks, by the
way, did not mind nudity,
so Archimedes” action was
not as bizarre as might be
thought.)
