Sumeria

From the Greek histories
and from Biblical accounts,
modern historians knew
something of Babylonian
and Assyrian history, but
archaeological investiga-
tions had to be depended
on to delve back earlier
still.

In 1922 the English ar-
chaeologist Leonard Wool-
ley (1880—1960) began his
investigations along the
course of the lower Euphra-
tes River, particularly at
what seemed to be the site
of Ur, a very early city men-
tioned in chapter 11 of Gen-
esis. His excavations
introduced moderns to the
ancient civilization of Su-
meria in what is now south-
eastern Iraq. Sumeria was
probably the first civiliza-
tion on Earth; it is the Su-
merians who invented writ-
ing.

Woolley's most star-
tling finding was geological
evidence of a great flood
that must have spread dev-
astation through Sumeria

about 2800 B.c. It was this
flood that gave rise to the
flood story in the epic of Gil-
gamesh (see 2500 B.c.) and
to the biblical account of
Noah's flood.

Woolley's findings were
a great stimulus to the fur-
ther study of early civiliza-
tions.

Tutankhamen'’s
Tomb

The ancient Egyptian pha-
raohs had magnificent
burials, and much in the
way of gold and other pre-
cious materials was in-
terred with them. Every
effort was made to keep the
tombs from being rifled
and the contents stolen,
even to the extent of plac-
ing the tomb at the center
of a solid pyramid.

All efforts failed. All
tombs were burglarized—
and a good thing, too. If all
the gold had remained bur-
ied, it would have ruined
the economy of the ancient
world. The tomb-robbers

did civilization a remark-
able favor by restoring the
tomb contents to circula-
tion.

By 1000 B.c., the great
days of the pharachs were
over, and every last tomb
was empty—except one.
From 1361 to 1352 B.c., the
pharaoh ruling over Egypt
had been Tutankhamen. He
was only about 21 when he
died, but he was given the
usual sumptuous burial.
His grave was at once
robbed, but for a wonder,
the robbers were caught in
the act and forced to return
the loot. Perhaps the fact
that the grave had been
looted had gotten out but
the return had been kept
quiet. At any rate, no fur-
ther effort at looting was
made for two centuries.
Then, while a grave was
being excavated for a later
pharaoh, the resulting
showers of stone chips cov-
ered the entrance to Tutan-
khamen'’s tomb, hiding it so
effectively that it came
down to the twentieth cen-
tury intact.
