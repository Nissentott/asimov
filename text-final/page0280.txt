bowls were connected by
means of arcs of metal dip-
ping from one bowl to the
next, one end of the arc
being copper and the other
being tin or zinc. Since any
group of similar objects
working as a unit may be
called a batiery, Volta's de-
vice was an electric battery
—the first in history.

Volta then made mat-
ters more compact and less
watery by using small
round plates of copper and
zinc, plus disks of card-
board moistened in salt so-
lution. Starting with
copper at the bottom, the
disks, reading upward,
were copper, zine, card-
board, copper, zinc, card-
board, and so on. If a wire
was attached to the top and
bottom of this battery, an

electric current would flow
when the circuit was
closed.

Decomposition
of Water

The existence of Volta’s
electric battery (see above)
was publicized on March
20, 1800. Within seven
weeks, it was put to work.

On May 2, an English chem-

ist, William Nicholson

(1753—1815), built a battery

of his own and passed an
electric current through
slightly acidified water.
Bubbles of hydrogen
and oxygen were produced
in the water. The water had
been electrolyzed and bro-
ken up into the hydrogen
and oxygen that had been
combined in its formation.
Volta had shown that a
chemical reaction taking
place between copper and
zinc in salt water could
form an electric current,
while Nicholson had shown
that the reverse was also
true, that an electric cur-

rent could produce a chemi-

cal reaction.

Later that year, the
German physicist Johann
Wilhelm Ritter (1776—
1810) allowed the gases
formed in electrolyzing
water to arise from two
wires and bubble into sepa-
rate containers. In one con-

tainer, hydrogen was col-
lected, and in the other, ox-
ygen. The volume of
hydrogen was just twice
the volume of the oxygen.
Ritter also passed a
current through a solution
of copper sulfate, and cop-
per appeared on the nega-
tive electrode. (This was
one of the two metal rods
sticking into the solution,
the other being the positive
electrode.) This was the be-
ginning of electro-plating.

Infrared
Radiation

It seemed natural to sup-
pose that light, by its very
nature, could be seen; light
that could not be seen
would be a contradiction in
terms. Yet invisible light ex-
isted.

Herschel (see 1781) in
1800 had formed a sunlight
spectrum and tested differ-
ent parts of it with a ther-
mometer to see if some
colors delivered more heat
than others. He found that
the temperature rose as he
moved toward the red end
of the spectrum, and it
seemed sensible to move
the thermometer just past
the red end in order to
watch the heating effect dis-
appear.

Except that it didn’t.
