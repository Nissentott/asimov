Geocentric
Universe

Claudius Ptolemaeus (2d
century), better known as
Ptolemy, was the last im-
portant astronomer of the
ancient world. He wrote a
summary of ancient astron-
omy, known later to the
Arabs as Almagest (the
greatest). He drew largely
from Hipparchus.

In this synthesis, he de-
scribed the Earth as the
center of the Universe and
all the planets as going
around it in combinations
of circular motions. In
order to account for the visi-
ble motions of the planets
across the skies, those com-
binations of circular mo-
tions had to be complicated
indeed, but Ptolemy
worked out mathematical
methods for predicting

planetary motions that
seemed adequate to his con-
temporaries and to future
generations for fourteen
centuries. (His chief instru-
ment was an astrolabe, a
device for determining the
latitude of the heavenly
bodies. It had been in-
vented a couple of centuries
before and is considered
the oldest of scientific in-
struments.)

Spinal Cord

A Greek physician, Galen
(129-ca. 199), worked at a
gladiatorial school at Perga-
mum, the city of his birth,
and there was able to gain
some rough-and-ready

hints on human anatomy.
In Rome, from 161 on, he
could dissect only animals,
which misled him now and
then as far as human anat-
omy was concerned.
Nevertheless, he did
good work on muscles, iden-

tifying many for the first
time, and showed that they
worked in groups. He also
showed the importance of
the spinal cord by cutting it
at various levels in animals
and noting the extent of the
resulting paralysis.
