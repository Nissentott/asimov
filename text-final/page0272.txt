Canning Food

The trouble with food is
that much of it doesn’t
keep. Fairly quickly, it rots,
sours, grows moldy. To pre-
serve food for periods of
time so that people don't
starve over the winter, use
must be made of drying,
salting, smoking, and so on.
A diet that depends on such
foods preserves life but is
monotonous.

The rising French mili-

tary leader Napoléon Bona-
parte (1769—1821) realized
the importance of decent
food to an army that had
all Europe arrayed against
it and offered a prize of
twelve thousand francs for
some way of preserving
fresh food for a long period
of time.

In 1795 a French inven-
tor, Nicolas-Francois Ap-
pert (1750-1841), began
working on the problem.
He knew that Spallanzani

(see 1768) had shown that
meat would not rot if it was
boiled for a long enough pe-
riod and then sealed. Ap-
pert therefore worked out a
system for applying this
principle on a large scale,
heating meats and vegeta-
bles and sealing them into
glass or metal containers.

It took some years to
perfect the process, but Ap-
pert's system represented
the beginning of the canned
food industry.
