Muller publicized this and
subsequently fought for the
safe handling of radiation.

M and N Blood
Groups

Landsteiner had discovered
the A, B, O series of blood
groups and demonstrated
their importance in blood
transfusion (see 1900). He
thought it was possible that
other blood groups might
exist that were not of im-
portance to transfusion but
that might still be of inter-

est in studying heredity,
distinguishing between geo-
graphically separated
human groups, determin-
ing paternity questions,
and so on.

Thus in 1927 Land-
steiner and his group dis-
covered blood groups they
designed as M, N, and MN.

Talking Pictures

For a quarter-century, mo-
tion pictures had been an
increasingly important
amusement for the world,
but in all that time they

had been silent, accompa-
nied only by the conven-
tional use of a tinkling
piano. By and large, the si-
lent movies consisted of a
dumb show, broken occa-
sionally by title plates.

Attemnpts had been
made now and then to add
sound to film, but the first
true success came on Octo-
ber 6, 1927, with the open-
ing of The Jazz Singer,
starring Al Jolson. This new
development spread with
amazing rapidity, and in
two or three years the si-
lent movie was dead.
