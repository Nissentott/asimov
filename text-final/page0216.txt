Trade Winds

Half a century before, Hal-
ley had tried to explain the
trade winds and monsoon
but had missed one essen-
tial point (see 1686). The

1736

British physicist George
Hadley (1685-1768) now
supplied it. He pointed out
that air near the Equator
had a faster west-to-east
motion than air farther
from the Equator. There-

fore, winds moving away
from the Equator tended to
drift eastward, while winds
moving toward the Equator
tended to drift westward.
This view proved satisfac-
tory.

 

Mechanics

Even Newton clung to an-
cient conventions when he
could. He wrote his great
book (see 1687) in Latin
rather than in English, and

although he obtained his re-

sults by the use of calculus,
he managed to put the
proofs into geometric forms
in his book.

In 1736, however, the
Swiss mathematician
Leonhard Euler (1707—
1783), the most prolific of

all time, wrote the first
book—Mechanics—to be
entirely devoted to that sub-
ject. In place of Newton'’s
geometry, he made use of
algebra and calculus when-
ever he could.
