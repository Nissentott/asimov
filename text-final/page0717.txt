Speed of Light

The first useful approxima-
tion of the speed of light
had been made by Olaus
Roemer (see 1675). Since
then, measurements had be-
come more and more pre-
cise, culminating for a
while in Michelson's mea-
surements (see 1927).

In October 1972, how-
ever, a research team
headed by Kenneth M.
Evenson, working with a
chain of laser beams in
Boulder, Colorado, ob-
tained a figure for the speed
of light that was far more
precise than anything pre-
viously reached. He mea-
sured the speed as
186,282.3959 miles per sec-
ond.

Earth Resources
Satellites

In 1972 the United States
launched Landsat I, the
first satellite specifically de-
signed to take large-scale
photographs of Earth that
would make it possible to
study global resources. Not
only did it give an overview
of geological data, but it
was capable of studying for-
est- and grain-growing
areas, yielding data on nor-
mal and abnormal growths,
plant disease, and so on.
Such Earth resource
satellites are one of the

many answers to those who
ask why so much money
and effort is expended on
space when there are so
many problems on Earth
that are crying out for
study. Space technology is
a powerful tool for studying
those problems.

The chief Soviet rocket
achievement of the year
was the Moon probe Lina
20, which, though without

a crew, reached the Moon,
made a soft landing,
scooped up a sample of soil,
and brought it safely back
to Earth.

By now it was well estab-
lished that quarks (see
1961) combine two at a
