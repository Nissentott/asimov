Quebec

The French explorer Sam-
uel de Champlain (ca.
1567—1635) was commis-

sioned by Henry 1V of
France to explore that por-
tion of the North American
coasl reached by Cartier
35). From 1603 on
he explored the St. Law-

Planetary Orbits

For nearly two thousand
years, since Plato (see 387
B.C.), it had been taken for
granted that planetary or-
bits were circles, if only be-
cause the circle was the
simplest curve and there-
fore the most elegant and
esthetic. Surely the heavens
would not deal with any-
thing else.

Planetary movements,
however, did not match the

notion of simple circular or-
bits, and the Greeks had to
assume combinations of cir-
cles that grew more and
more complicated as obser-
vations of actual planetary
motions across the sky
grew more precise
Copernicus placed the
Sun, rather than the Earth
at the center of the Uni
verse, but kept circular os
bits, which meant that
there still had to be compli
cated combinations, al-
