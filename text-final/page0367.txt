1853

 

Age of the Sun

It had been assumed for
thousands of years that the
Sun was eternal and
changeless (and would be
until God wished to put it
to an end). The discovery of
sunspots (see 1610) had
shaken this belief but not
destroyed it.

Once the law of conser-
vation of energy was well
established (see 1847), how-
ever, the shining of the Sun
had to be questioned. Light
and heat were energy, and
this could not be created
out of nothing. Where,
then, did the Sun obtain
the energy that had kept it
shining brilliantly enough
to warm the Earth at a dis-
tance of nearly a hundred
million miles for all the
many thousands of years of
history? It could not be or-
dinary burning, for the en-
tire substance of the Sun
would have been consumed
in a mere fifteen hundred
years in that case.

Helmbholtz, who had
been the one to establish
the law of energy conserva-
tion, pondered the matter
and by 1853 had decided
that the only energy supply
that would suffice was that

of the Sun's own gravitation.

Slowly, the Sun’s globe
must be contracting, and
the falling inward of that
huge mass must be supply-
ing the energy that was con-
verted into light and heat.
This must be the continua-
tion of a process that had
begun when a gigantic
cloud of dust and gas had
contracted to form the Sun
in the first place (see 1796).

In order to supply light
and heat at the current
rate, Helmholiz concluded,
the Sun must have con-
tracted from a size filling
the orbit of the Earth to its
present size in something
like twenty-five million
years. That meant Earth
could be no older than that.
Moreover, it meant that in
another ten million years,
the Sun would be too small
and cool to support life on
Earth.

This conclusion came
as a great shock to geolo-
gists, who already thought
the Earth must be consider-
ably older than twenty-five
million years. It was to be
another half-century before
the controversy was settled
—in favor of the geologists.

Glider

Balloons had been in exis-
tence for seventy years,
proving that objects that
were themselves denser
than air could remain aloft
under proper conditions of
winds and updrafts.

Nevertheless, the En-
glish engineer George
Cayley (see 1809) was the
first to study, scientifically,
the conditions under which
air might keep a heavier-
than-air object aloft. He
thus founded the science of
aerodynamics. He realized
that what was needed were
fixed wings, like the flaps of
a flying squirrel, rather
than moving wings, like
those of birds.

He worked out the
basic shape that airplanes
would eventually have—
wings, tail, streamlined fu-
selage, and rudder. He also
realized that he needed an
engine and propeller to be
able to proceed against the
wind, but he knew that no
engine then existing would
be light and powerful
enough to do so.

In 1853 he built the
first device so constructed
aerodynamically as to glide
with the wind and lift with
the updrafts—a glider, as it
