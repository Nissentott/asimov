once the news broke, profes-
sional astronomers zeroed
their instruments in upon
it. The comet has ever since
been known as Halley's
comet, or in line with the
conventions of the present
day, Comet Halley. Calculat-
ing backward, Hall

comet turned out to be the
one that appeared at the
time of the invasion of En-
gland by William of Nor-
mandy. It was also the
comet that Giotto painted
(see 1304).

The return of Halley's
comet suddenly made com-
ets the headliners of astron-
omy, and for several
decades it seemed that the
greatest feat any astrono-
mer could achieve was to
discover comets.

Flame Tests

It was always a difficult
task for chemists to distin-
guish one substance from
another when some clearly

ble property difference
(color, softness, and so on)
didn’te hemists then
had to test for more subtle
differences.

A new test that pro-
duced something clear
visible to the eye was dis-
covered by a German chem-
ist, Andreas Sigismund
Marggraf (1709—1782), in
1758. Marggraf found that
sodium compounds turned
a flame yellow, while other-

ise very similar potas-

um compounds turned
it violet. (Of course, while
the compounds were

known, the elements so-
dium and potassium were
not to be isolated for half a
centur
This introduced the
flame test into chemistry.
Later, Cronstedt ( 751)
d the blowpipe,
ected a thin jet of
into a flame, making i
hotter and more effectively

duce delicate
