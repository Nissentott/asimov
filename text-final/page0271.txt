Meteorites

It was the common experi-
ence of human beings that
objects sometimes fell from
the sky. Such falls had been
reported. The Kaaba, the
sacred black stone of the
Muslims, was probably a
meteorite that fell from the
sky. In Ephesus, a stone
was worshipped in the tem-
} ple of Artemis that was
probably a meteorite, and
periodically reports of wit-
nessed falls were received.

During the Age of Rea-
son, such tales were dis-
counted and dismissed by
men of science.

In 1794, however, a
German physicist, Ernst

 

Florens Friedrich Chladni
(1756—1827), published a
book in which he suggested
that meteorites did fall and
that this happened because
the space near Earth con-
tained the debris of a
planet that had once ex-
isted but had exploded.

This was the first time
that a reasonable explana-
tion had been offered for
meteorites, and the tide
slowly began to turn. It
took a while, though.

Rare Earths

The term earth at this time
was applied to any oxide
that was insoluble in water

and resistant to the action
of heat. The Earth's crust
was largely a mixture of
these oxides, hence the
name. Examples of com-
mon earths are calcium
oxide, magnesium oxide,
iron oxide, and silicon diox-
ide.

A Finnish chemist,
Johan Gadolin (1760—
1852), studied a strange
mineral that had been ob-
tained from a quarry in
Ytterby (near Stockholm).
Gadolin recognized it as a
new earth unlike any pre-
viously known. He called it
a rare earth to distinguish it
from the common ones.
From this rare earth and
from others like it, a num
