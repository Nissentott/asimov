the wind, or by suspending
hides from a central pole.
These were the first crude
homes. Where caves ex-
isted, Homo erectus found
shelter there. The first
traces of Homo erectus in
Asia (Black’s findings near
Peking) were in a filled-up
cave.

The cave near Peking
had traces of campfires.
This meant that fire had
been “discovered”” some
five hundred thousand
years ago. Here is a charac-
teristic that marks off
human beings from all
other organisms. Every
human society in existence,
however primitive, has un-
derstood and made use of
fire. No living creature
other than human beings
uses fire in even the most
primitive fashion.

I have put discovered in
quotation marks, for fire
was not discovered in the
usual sense. Lightning
could start a fire ever since
Earth’s atmosphere gained
enough oxygen to sustain
one and Earth's land sur-
face possessed a forest
cover that could burn, and
that means for some four
hundred million years.
From that fire, then as now,
any animal capable of flee-
ing would flee.

By the discovery of fire,
then, we really mean its
taming. At some time,
Homo erectus learned how

to retrieve some burning
object from the edge of a
naturally caused fire, keep
the fire alive by feeding it
judicious amounts of fuel
whenever it showed signs
of dying down, and make
good use of it.

How this happened we
don’t know. My own guess
is that it began when chil-
dren grew fascinated by
leaping flames. With their
overactive curiosity, and
with the lack of bitter expe-
rience of what happens
when one is burnt, they
might be more likely to
play with it than adults
would be. Presumably, the
nearest adult would snatch
the child away from the fire
and stamp it out. On the
other hand, the time might
come when an adult, more
venturesome than most,
might see the advantage of
continuing the play in a
more purposeful manner.

The use of fire changed
human life completely. For
one thing, it gave light in
the dark and warmth at
any time. This made it pos-
sible to extend activity into
nighttime and winter,
which would be particu-
larly important in a glacial
period for it meant Homo
erectus could extend its
range into the cooler re-
gions.

Of course with fire
alone one is condemned in
cold weather to hug the
hearth, but a hunting soci-

ety could easily get the no-
tion of scraping an animal
hide clean and wrapping
oneselfin it. In this way, an-
imal fur would replace the
hair human beings had
lost.

Fire was also useful as
a means of protection from
other animals, even the
fiercest. A fire in a cave or
within a circle of stones
would keep the predators
away. They might snarl
and slink about the out-
skirts, but if they were not
intelligent enough to stay
away from fire, one experi-
ence of its nearness was all
they would need. In fact,
Homo erectus could now
carry burning branches to
scare game and send it
stampeding into traps and
off cliffs.

Then, too, fire made it
possible to cook food. This
is more important than
might appear. Meat is ten-
derer and tastier if roasted.
What's more, roasting kills
parasites and bacteria so
that the meat is safer to
eat. Eventually fire made
plant food, otherwise inedi-
ble, supremely edible. Try
eating rice fresh from the
stalk, or uncooked grain of
any kind, and you'll under-
stand what a little applica-
tion of heat from a fire can
do.

Finally, fire made possi-
ble various chemical
changes in inanimate mat-
ter, such as the smelting of
