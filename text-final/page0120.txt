Cubic Equations

At this time, mathemati-
cians found it easy to solve
equations of the first degree
(linear equations, involving
x) and of the second degree
(quadratic equations, involv-
ing x?). Equations of the
third degree (cubic equa-
tions, involving x*) defeated
them.

In 1535, however, the
Italian mathematician Nic-
colo Tartaglia (1499-1557)
found a general method for
solving cubic equations. In
those days, mathematicians
would often keep their dis-
coveries secret and parade
their ability to solve prob-
lems others could not. This

raised their reputations
and gave them a feeling of
power. However, another
Italian mathematician, Ge-
ronimo Cardano (1501—
1576), wheedled the cubic
equation solution out of
Tartaglia and then pub-
lished it, so that Cardano is
often given credit for the
discovery.

Tartaglia objected
loudly, but the event set an
important precedent. Scien-
tific discoveries do not be-
long to the discoverer but
to the world. If discoverers
all clutched their discover-
ies close to their chests in
order to garner personal
glory, the progress of sci-
ence would creak to a halt.

It has therefore become a
rule that credit for a discov-
ery goes not necessarily to
the original discoverer, but
to the first who publishes
the discovery.

This encourages publi-
cation and allows all scien-
tists to learn of discoveries
as soon as possible. Science
as we know it would not
exist without the “first pub-
lication’' rule, and Car-
dano, by his dishonorable
action, pushed science in
that direction, thus doing
he world more good than
he did Tartaglia harm.
