Cotton Gin

The new textile industry of
Great Britain, and the one
that was just beginning to
arise in New England,
meant increasing demands
for cotton, which could be
grown with great profusion
in the southern states. How-
ever, it was difficult to pull
the cotton threads off the
seeds in the cotton bolls,
and that limited the quan-
tity that could be produced.
In April 1793, however,
an American inventor, Eli
Whitney (1765â€”1825), chal-
lenged to do something

about the problem, in-
vented the cotton gin (gin is
short for engine). It was a
simple device in which
metal wires poked through
slats and entangled them-
selves in the cotton fibers.
The wires were affixed to a
wheel, and as the wheel
turned, the cotton fibers
were pulled off. One gin
could produce 50 pounds of
cleaned cotton per day.
The effect on the
United States was cata-
strophic. The southern
states began to produce cot-
ton in great quantities, and
slaves were needed, also in

great quantity, to pull the
bolls off the plants so that
the gins would have enough
to work on.

The southern states,
which had been giving up
on slavery, had to return to
it now, defend it, and work
up all sorts of ex
its existence. Theyv devel-
oped an agricultural econ-
omy based on slave labor,
which kept them poor,
while the northern states
grew rich on wheat and in
dustry. And in the e
