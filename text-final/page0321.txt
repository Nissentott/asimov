Ohm’s Law

After Fourier had worked
out the mathematical sys-
tem that described the flow
of heat adequately (see
1822), it seemed that the
same system might be used
to describe the flow of elec-
tricity. Whereas heat flow
from point to point de-
pended on the tempera-
tures of the two points and
the heat conductivity of the
material between, so elec-
tric flow from point to
point might depend on

the electrical potential

of the two points and on
the electrical conduct-

ivity of the material
between.

By working with wires
of different thicknesses and
lengths, the German physi-
cist Georg Simon Ohm
(1789-1854) found that the
quantity of current trans-
mitted was inversely pro-
portional to the length of
the wire and directly pro-
portional to its cross-sec-
tional area. He was in this
way able to define the resis-
tance of the wire and, in
1827, showed that, “The
flow of current through a
conductor is directly pro-
portional to the potential
difference and inversely

proportional to the resis-
tance.” This is called Ohm's
law,

Turbines

Waterwheels had been in
use since ancient times,
with the water hitting the
vanes on the outer edge of
the wheel. A French engi-
neer, Benoit Fourneyron
(1802-1867), heard his
teacher talk of a new kind
of waterwheel that he
called a turbine (from a
Latin word meaning
“whirling”). The water
would come down the hub
and move out to the vanes,
setting the wheel turning.
The faster the wheel
turned, the faster the water
would be thrown out
against the vanes. In the
end, the wheel would turn
much more rapidly and
deliver far more power
than an ordinary water-
wheel.,

Such a turbine existed
only in theory, but in 1827
Fourneyron built one that
developed 6 horsepower.
Within a few years, he built
one that developed 50
horsepower. The thought of
a turbine driven by steam
oceurred to him, but he
lacked materials capable of

withstanding the high tem-
perature. The steam tur-
bine had to wait another
half-century to come into
existence.

Screw Propeller

Steamships were propelled
by large paddlewheels on
one side during the quar-
ter-century of their exis-
tence. They worked well
enough ordinarily, but in
rough seas they could lift
out of the water altogether
if the ship listed to the
other side, and that compli-
cated steering. Further-
more, they were vulnerable
to enemy fires so that it
was considered completely
impractical to power war-
ships by steam.

In 1827, however, a
British engineer, Robert
Wilson (1803—1882), de-
signed a screw propeller,
which worked from the
stern of the ship, so that it
was symmetrically placed
and was little affected by
the ship’s rolling. It was
also well under water and
so less vulnerable than the
rest of the ship. Since it
was judged to be a more ef-
ficient propulsion mecha-
nism than the paddlewheel,
