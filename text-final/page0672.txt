protons, which liberated
antineutrinos rather than
neutrinos. However, if anti-
neutrinos existed, no scien-
tist alive would doubt for a
minute that neutrinos ex-
isted also.)

Although antineutrinos
scarcely interact with other
particles, every once in a
while one out of trillions
will collide squarely with a
proton, converting it to a
neutron (the opposite of the
change that produced the
antineutrino in the first
place) and liberating an an-
tielectron (positron) as
well. It was necessary to
watch for the simultaneous
appearance of a neutron
and an antielectron, to-
gether with gamma rays of
a certain energy arising
after a certain interval.

In 1956 two American
physicists, Frederick Reines
(b. 1918) and Clyde Lorrain
Cowan (b. 1919), set up the
necessary detection system
and snared a few antineutri-
nos.

Eventually, neutrinos
themselves were detected
in solar radiation.

Conservation of
Parity
Physicists had worked out

conservation laws that dic-
tated conservation of en-

ergy, momentum, angular
momentum, and electric
charge, among others. In
every case, this meant that
the total quantity of that
property in a closed system
(one that did not interact
with objects outside the sys-
tem) could not change, no
matter what happened
within the system. The as-
sumption was that such
conservation laws were uni-
versal.

The study of subatomic
particles showed that these
conservation laws held in
the subatomic realm as
well. In addition, new
conservation laws were
discovered, such as the
conservation of parity. Par-
ity was the quality of being
either odd or even. Just as
in numbers, odd parity plus
odd parity equaled even
parity; even parity plus
even parity equaled even
parity; but odd parity plus
even parity equaled odd
parity. Each particle was
assigned a particular par-
ity, either odd or even, so
that the total of all the par-
ticles in a closed system
was either odd or even. No
matter what happened to
the particles within the sys-
tem, if it began even, it
ended even, and if it began
odd, it ended odd. At least,
so it was assumed.

Then trouble arose
with kaons. Sometimes

kaons broke down to two
pions, which together had
even parity; and sometimes
to three pions, which to-
gether had odd parity, It
was concluded that there
were two kinds of kaons,
one with even parity and
one with odd. However, no
one could detect any differ-
ence between the two kinds
of kaons or predict which
one a particular kaon
would be.

In 1956 two Chinese
physicists, Yang Chen Ning
(b. 1922) and Lee Tsung-
dao (b. 1926), suggested
that there was only one
kind of kaon, but that since
kaons broke down through
the weak interaction, and
since in the weak interac-
tion parity was not neces-
sarily conserved, then a
kaon could break down into
either two or three pions in-
discriminately. They
pointed out that if parity
was conserved in the weak
interaction, then in certain
particle changes, electrons
would come out in equal
amounts, left and right. If
parity was not conserved,
then electrons would come
out predominantly in one
direction. The experiment
was performed, and the
electrons came out predom-
inantly in one direction.

This meant that al-
though parity seemed to be
conserved in the strong in-
