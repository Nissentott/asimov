a great advance when the
Dutch-born American phys-
icist Peter Joseph William
Debye (1884—1966) showed,
in 1917, that useful results
could be obtained when X
rays were diffracted by
powdered solids that con-
sisted of tiny crystals ori-
ented in every direction.

The technique was also
discovered independently,
and at about the same time,
by the American physicist
Albert Wallace Hull (1880—
1966).

100-Inch
Telescope

In no science is the advance
of instrumentation as im-
portant and as dramatic as
in astronomy. In 1917 a
new reflecting telescope
was put into action on
Mount Wilson, near Pasa-
dena, California. Its mirror
was 100 inches across,
which made it the largest
telescope in the world at
that time, and it was to re-
main the largest for three
decades.

Protactinium

Few of the new substances
being detected as radioac-
tive breakdown products of
uranium and thorium were
truly new elements. Once

Soddy's isotope concept
had been advanced (see
1913), most of the new sub-
stances were recognized as
isotopes of elements that
were already known.

In 1917, however, the
German physical chemist
Otto Hahn (1879-1968) and
a co-worker, Austrian physi-
cist Lise Meitner (1878—
1968), discovered a truly
new element that disinte-
grated into actinium (see
1899). They therefore
named the new element
protactinium (meaning “be-
fore actinium”).

It turned out to be ele-
ment number 91, one of the
seven missing elements at
the time Moseley had ad-
vanced his atomic num-
ber concept (see 1914).
That left only six elements
to go.

Sonar

Pierre Curie, in discovering
piezoelectricity (see 1880),
had shown how to produce
ultrasonic sound vibra-
tions, These were put to use
by the French physicist
Paul Langevin (1872—1946).
Waves are more easily
reflected the shorter their
length. Ordinary sound
waves are long enough to
bend around ordinary ob-
stacles and are not effi-
ciently reflected. The much
shorter sound waves of ul-

trasonic vibration can eas-
ily be reflected by relatively
small objects. The direction
from which the reflection is
received indicates the direc-
tion of the object, and the
time it takes between emis-
sion and reflection (know-
ing the speed of sound)
gives the distance, or range,
of the object.

Since light cannot pen-
etrate large thicknesses of
water and ultrasonic vibra-
tions can, the latter can be
used to detect underwater
objects such as submarines
when light is impotent.
Since World War I was rag-
ing and German subma-
rines were a deadly danger
to the Allies, it is not sur-
prising that Langevin
worked with that purpose
in mind.

Langevin's system of
echolocation was called
sonar, an acronym (combi-
nation of initial letters) of
sound navigation and rang-
ing. While Langevin had
the technique worked out
in 1917, it could not be put
into effective use before the
end of the war.

Sonar is now used not
only for the detection of un-
derwater objects such as
submarines and schools
of fish, but also to study
the conformation of the
ocean floor. Sonar utterly
revolutionized oceanog-
raphy.
