Human beings had been
manipulating numbers ever
since they had begun writ-
ing, about twenty-three cen-
turies earlier. In general,
there would be a tendency
to make score marks for
units, so that 4 would
be /// /. Different marks
would be introduced for
fives, tens, and fifties, to
avoid having to make too
many score marks. Or else,
as in the case of the Jews
and Greeks, letters of the al-
phabet would be used
(which introduced nonsig-
nificant connections be-
tween words and numbers
and introduced the supersti-
tious folly of numerology).
It might have occurred
to someone to use the same
numbers for units, tens,
hundreds, and so on,
merely placing the num-
bers in different positions

for each level, as on an aba-
cus (see 500 B.c.). No one
tried this positional nota-
tion, however, because no
one thought of using a sym-
bol for an abacus level in
which no beads had been
moved

For example, if you
want to indicate 507 on an
abacus, you move 5 beads
at the hundreds level and 7
at the units level. You can
record the 5 and the 7, but
how do you indicate that
the tens level hasn't been
touched?

About the year 500,
some Indian mathemati-
cian suggested that such an
untouched abacus level be
given a special symbol.
(Our symbol is 0 and we
call it zero.) This meant
that you could no longer
confuse 507 with 57 or 570.
The Arabs may have picked
it up from the Hindus
about the year 700.

 

The first important
mathematician to make use
of this positional notation
was an Arab, Muhammad
ibn Al-Khwarizmi (780â€”
850), who wrote a book fea-
turing it about 810. (In the
book he coined a term that
in English became algebra.)

The new system slowly
penetrated Europe, which
took centuries to give up its
clumsy Roman numerals
and take up the new Arabic
numerals (although, of
course, the numerals were
Indian to start with). It
took centuries to overcome
the habit of sticking to
something inconvenient
but customary rather than
adopting something good
but new. Still, it was done
in the end, and the transi-
tion democratized arith-
metical computation,
bringing it within reach of
everyone.
