able. However, reliability
improved rapidly, and by
1953 the first significant
transistorized instruments
for use by the general pub-
lic were introduced. These
were hearing aids that were
so small they could fit into
the ear opening. They re-
placed, and worked better
than, previous devices,
which were heavy, bulky,
and embarrassingly notice-
able.

Meanwhile, Japan was
working to produce transis-
torized radios, which

would be much smaller
than any till then in use
and more reliable. The
world was about to enter

age of miniaturization

 

 

Spray Cans

In 1953 a new plastic valve
mechanism was des 1
by the American inventor
Robert H. Abplanalp (b
1923), which made it possi
ble to produce an alumi-
num spray can cheaply.
The spray could be ejected
by evaporating Freon (see

 

 

930), which was a liquid

sily and

 

1t evaporated e:

sures
As a result, there was a

Salk Vaccine

Poliomyelitis (infantile pa-
ralysis) was a particularly
frightening disease, be-
cause when it did not kill, it
often paralyzed perma-
nently, leaving people in
wheelchairs or even iron

lungs. What's more, it often
hit young people

Once the polio virus
could be cultured in chick
embryos, however, as
shown by Enders and his
group (see 1948), it was

nt

 

possible to experime

 

with it

 

Thus the

 

  
 

 

 

can
crobiologist Jo Edward
Salk (b. 1914) tried to kill
the virus, so that it woutlc
not give rise 1o
but to leave it suffic
intact that it would m
