1576

 

 

Northwest
Passage

The English, having failed
at the Northeast Passage
(see 1553), tried their hand
at the Northwest Passage
around the northern shores
of North America.

In 1576 an English nav-

igator, Martin Frobisher

(ca. 1535-1594), sailed to
North America with three
ships and thirty-five men.
He sailed northward from
the Labrador area and dis-
covered what we now call
Baffin Island, a large island
west of Greenland.

In a second voyage, in
1578, Frobisher sighted
Greenland itself (see 982).
By the time Frobisher ar-

rived, the Viking settlers
had died or departed and
its shores were occupied
only by Inuit (Eskimos).
From this time on, Green-
land remained part of
world geography.
Frobisher did not dis-
cover any practical North-
west Passage, however.

 

1577

 

Distance of
Comets

Tycho Brahe (see 1572),
with the help of the Danish

king, set up the first real as-

tronomical observatory, on
the island of Hven in the
strait between Denmark

and Sweden, outfitting it
with the best instruments
he could make.

In 1577 a bright comet
appeared in the sky and
Tycho observed it carefully.
By Greek notions, it was an
atmospheric phenomenon,
and therefore it should
have a large parallax. How-

ever, Tycho could find
none, and was certain that
it was at a distance far be-
yond that of the Moon. This
was another serious blow
against Greek astronomy.
