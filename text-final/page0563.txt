1927

 

Uncertainty
Principle

It had always been as-
sumed by scientists that
given enough patience,
enough delicacy, and the
proper instruments, any
and all properties of any-
thing observable could be
measured to any degree of
accuracy. It seemed axiom-
atic.

In 1927, however,
Heisenberg (see 1925)
showed that a careful con-
sideration of quantum me-
chanics proved this to be
wrong. One could deter-
mine, for instance, the mo-
mentum of a subatomic
particle to any degree of
precision, and the position
of a subatomic particle to
any degree of precision, but
one could not determine
both at the same time to any
degree of precision. The
more closely you deter-
mined a particle’'s momen-
tum, the less certain you
could be of its position, and
vice versa. (The same was
true if you tried to deter-
mine both the energy con-
tent of a particle and the
exact time at which you
were trying to observe it.)
The uncertainty in the

knowledge of momentum
multiplied by the uncer-
tainty in the knowledge of
position was equal to
Planck's constant (see
1900).

Planck’s constant rep-
resented, so to speak, the
graininess of the Universe.
It seemed that if you tried
to inspect the Universe very
closely indeed, you would
come up against the grain
and could detect nothing
finer than that.

It was rather like try-
ing to magnify a photo-
graph made up of tiny
patches of dark and light.
Under ordinary conditions,
the picture looks smooth
and well defined. Magnify
it sufficiently, though, and
the tiny patches expand till
the picture seems to be a
chaos of meaningless light
and dark. You have reached
the limits of magnification
and of further information.

Heisenberg had discov-
ered the uncertainty princi-
ple. At first glance, it would
seem to negate any hope sci-
entists might have of dis-
covering “truth” to the
finest detail, but looked at
in another way, the uncer-
tainty prineiple is how the
Universe works, and its ex-
istence as a limitation ex-

plains many facets of the
Universe that would be
meaningless if that limita-
tion did not exist. For exam-
ple, to explain why helium
doesn't freeze at ordinary
pressures, even at absolute
zero, requires a line of rea-
soning in which the uncer-
tainty principle plays an
essential part.

It was for this principle
that Heisenberg was
awarded the Nobel Prize
for physics in 1932.

Electron
Diffraction

De Broglie had suggested
that electrons and indeed
all particles had wave as-
pects (see 1923). No one
since, however, had actu-
ally caught a particle be-
having like a wave.

An American physicist,
Clinton Joseph Davisson
(1881-1958), however, was
studying the reflection of
electrons from a metallic
nickel target enclosed in a
vacuum tube. The tube
shattered by accident, and
the heated nickel promptly
developed a film of oxide
that made it useless as a tar-
get. To remove the film, Da-
visson heated the nickel for
