Bacteriophage
Structure

The electron microscope
(see 1932) had reached a
pitch of excellence by now
and could show viral struc-
ture as ordinary light mi-
croscopes could show
cellular structure.

In 1942 the Italian-
born American microbiolo-
gist Salvador Edward
Luria (b. 1912) managed to
get good photographs of
bacteriophages. These were
unusually large viruses, to
be sure, but they were con-
siderably smaller than bac-
terial cells. Luria showed
that the bacteriophage con-

sisted of a rounded head
and a thin tail, rather like
an extremely small sperm
cell. This was the first time
a virus had been seen as
anything more than a
vague dot.
