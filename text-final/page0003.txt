of bipedal reptiles and
mammals like the tyranno-
saur and the kangaroo.
Long tails provide balance,
and the body remains essen-
tially horizontal.

Suppose, though, a
quadruped’s body ends at
the hips and there is no tail
to act as a balance. In that
case, the only way the
body'’s center of gravity can
be brought above the hind
legs is to tip the entire body
into a vertical position.

Some tailless animals
actually do this. Bears and
chimpanzees can stand up-
right on their hind legs and
even walk about in this
fashion, but they are
clearly uncomfortable
doing so and prefer to let
the forelegs share the work.
Penguins, too, hold their
bodies upright, but they are
swimmers and clumsy on
land. Though they can walk
long distances if they must,
they prefer to belly-whop
on ice when they can.

The human being,
then, is a tailless, habitual,
and comfortable biped. But
what is it that makes the
human a comfortable
walker on two legs?

It is that the spinal col-
umn, just above the pelvis,
bends backward in human
beings, assuming a shallow
S-shape and adding a
spring to the human walk
that makes it comfortable.

No other organism has that
backward bend of the spine
in the small of the back.
Bipedality also produces
problems. There are
slipped disks, inflamed si-
nuses, and accidental falls,
for instance. None of these
would be likely were it not
that human beings are still
not entirely adapted to
walking upright.)

The earliest hominids
were first identified by an
Australian-born South Afri-
can anthropologist, Ray-
mond Arthur Dart (1893—
1988), to whom a skull,
rather human-looking ex-
cept for its extraordinarily
small size, was brought
from a South African lime-
stone quarry in 1924. Dart,
in 1925, named the type of
organism to which the skull
belonged Australopithecus
(from Greek words mean-
ing “‘southern ape”). Fur-
ther finds made it clear
that it was not an ape but a
hominid, and at least four
different species have now
been identified, which are
lumped together as austra-
lopithecines.

In 1974 an American
anthropologist, Donald Jo-
hanson, unearthed an un-
precedentedly complete
and ancient skeleton of an
australopithecine female,
who was given the name
Lucy. (You can tell a female
from a male by the shape of
its pelvis.) [t was possibly

as much as four million
years old judging from the
age of the rocks in which it
was found.

Lucy is an example of
Australopithecus afarensis,
because Afars is the name
of the region in east-central
Africa where her remains
were found. Australopithe-
cines existed only in cast-
ern and southern Africa, so
east-central Africa may
have been the cradle of hu-
manity.

Lucy was the size of a
chimpanzee and slighter in
build. Her australopithe-
cine relatives seem to have
ranged between 3 and 4
feet in height and to have
weighed perhaps 65
pounds. Their brains were
no larger than a chimpan-
zee's and about a quarter
the size of our own.

The early australopith-
ecines probably lived much
as chimpanzees do, may
have spent their time
partly in trees, must have
been very largely vegetar-
ian, and undoubtedly could
not speak. However, they
were as bipedal as we are
and walked as casily and as
comfortably on their hind
legs as we do.

Why did the australo-
pithecines develop the
backward bend in the
spine? Why did the pro-
cesses of evolution invent
the hominid, in other
words?
