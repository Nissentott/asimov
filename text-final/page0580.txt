called heavy hydrogen or
deuterivom (from the Greek
word for “two"). For this
discovery, Urey was
awarded the Nobel Prize
for chemistry in 1934.

Resonance

Four years earlier, London
had applied quantum me-
chanics to the electron-
sharing between hydrogen
atoms in the hydrogen mol-
ecule. In 1931 the American
chemist Linus Carl Pauling
(b. 1901) extended this to
the electron-sharing in or-
ganic compounds gener-
ally.

Consider the benzene
molecule, for instance. It
consists of six carbon
atoms in a hexagonal ring,
with one hydrogen atom
attached to each carbon
atom. Such a ring must
have single bonds and dou-
ble bonds in alternation.
Double bonds in ordinary
organic compounds repre-
sent a region of activity
where two hydrogen atoms
can easily be added. In the
case of benzene, however,
the double bonds are stable
and are difficult to add to.
The great stability of the
benzene ring was a puzzle.
Some suggested that the
double bonds switched end-
lessly, so that any given ad-
jacent pair of atoms were

connected by a single bond
and a double bond in rapid
alternation.

Pauling showed in
1931, however, that if all
the atoms of a molecule
were in a single plane (as
was true of benzene) and
symmetrically placed (as
was again true of benzene),
then the electron waves
would spread out over the
carbon atoms generally, so
that what connected the
carbon atoms was neither
an ordinary single bond nor
an ordinary double bond
but something intermedi-
ate between the two. This
spreading out of the elec-
trons (resonance) repre-
sented a very stable
conformation, and any mol-
ecule increased in stability
where there was an oppor-
tunity for resonance.

The concept of reso-
nance helped greatly in ex-
plaining the manner of
chemical reactions and
made them far more pre-
dictable. For this, and for
his work on chemical struc-
ture made possible by the
concept of resonance, Pau-
ling was awarded the
Nobel Prize for chemistry
in 1954,

Androsterone

Butenandt had isolated es-
trone, a female sex hor-
mone (see 1929). It seemed

obvious that if female sex
hormones existed, male sex
hormones must also exist.

In 1931 Butenandt ob-
tained a small quantity of a
hormene that was named
androsterone (from the
Greek word for “man”’). It
is produced by cells of the
testicle and stimulates the
type of development re-
quired to produce the char-
acteristics of the adult
male. Butenandt isolated
only 15 milligrams of the
hormone (a two-thousandth
of an ounce), but by deli-
cate microanalytical meth-
ods, he was able to make
two analyses of the com-
pound.

For his work on the sex
hormones, Butenandt was
awarded a share of the
Nobel Prize for chemistry
in 1939,

Neoprene

Rubber had become a vital
resource in an age of auto-
mobiles. Its use in tires was
essential, and it had a myr-
iad of other uses as well.
The major producer of rub-
ber was originally Brazil,
but production had been
transferred to Malaya. The
possibility of such a distant
source being cut off in time
of war or political unrest
made it advisable, even im-
perative, that the industrial
nations of Europe and
