Rabies

Rabies, or hydrophobia, is
a severe disease of the cen-
tral nervous system. It can
occur in any warm-blooded
animal. The microorganism
that causes it can be pres-
ent in the salivary glands
and may be communicated
by a bite. For human be-
ings, dogs can be particu-
larly dangerous. They
become excitable and vi-
cious (“mad dogs”) when
they have the disease, and
bite at the slightest cause,
or for no cause at all.

Once infected, it may
take quite a while for a
human being to show symp-
toms, because the microor-
ganism has to penetrate the
nervous system, but once it
is established there, death
is fairly quick, almost cer-
tain, and agonizing.

Pasteur tried to treat
the disease as he had
treated anthrax (see 1881),
by developing an attenu-
ated and feeble preparation
of the causative agent that
would give immunity but
not the disease. He showed
that an attenuated agent
could be obtained by pass-
ing a rabies infection
through a variety of differ-
ent species of animals until
its virulence had abated.

In 1885 Pasteur made
the first use of his attenu-
ated preparation to pre
a case of rabies in a boy,
Joseph Meister (1878—
1940), who had been bitten
by a mad dog. The treat-
ment worked, and the boy
was saved.

Purines and

Pyrimidines
Since the nucleic acids had
been discovered by
Miescher (see 1869), little
had been done to determine
their molecular structure.

Then the German bio-
chemist Albrecht Kossel
(1853-1927) took up the
matter. He got rid of the
proteins ciated with
the nucleic acids and
worked on the material it-
self. By 1885 he had ob-
tained substances from it
that included the double-
ring purines Emil Fischer
had studied a few years ear-
lier (see 1884). He also ob-
tained pyrimidines, whose
molecule re made up of
a single ring of atoms, four
carbons and two nitrogens

He isolated two differ-
