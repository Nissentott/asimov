Cosmonaut
Transfer

On January 14, 1969, two
Soviet spacecraft, each car-
rying cosmonauts, met in
space, and cosmonauts
passed from one ship to the
other. It was the first time
human beings had trans-
ferred from one spacecraft
to another in flight and was
another advance in human
mobility in space.

Optical Pulsars

Pulsars (see 1967), which
had been shown to be rotat-
ing neutron stars (see
1968), ought, perhaps, to
give off photons of all energ-
ies, There ought to be
pulses not only of micro-
waves but of visible light,
for instance. However,
small light pulses are not
as easily detected as micro-
wave pulses are, and light,
being more energetic,
would not be given off in
the intensities of micro-
waves.

1t made sense, then, to
look in places where neu-
tron stars might have
formed comparatively re-
cently, since they would be
particularly energetic. In
particular, the Crab nebula
was a good possibility. The
light of its supernova explo-
sion had reached Earth
only a little over nine centu-

 

ries previously (see 1054
and 1848), and the pulsar
at its center had the short-
est period of rotation (â€˜50 of
a second) then known. That
meant it was energy-rich.
In January 1969, sure
enough, a star near the cen-
ter of the Crab nebula was
found to be blinking on and
off thirty times a second, in
time to the microwave
pulses. It was the first opti-
cal pulsar to be detected.
The Crab nebula pulsar
was found to be emitting
pulses of X rays as well.

Antarctic
Meteorites

One of the difficulties in
studying meteorites is iden-
tifying them in the first
place. A lump of nickel-iron
that has clearly not been
the result of metallurgical
smelting can only be a me-
teorite. However, less than
10 percent of the meteorites
that reach Earth are of nick-
el-iron, and many of those
that fell in the past were
collected by people who
made use of iron, so that no
iron meteorites are to be
found at all in those areas
where civilization has ex-
isted the longest.

The majority of meteor-
ites, however, are stony in
nature and not to be distin-
guished from ordinary
rocks without careful analy-

sis. Since one can't go
about analyzing every rock,
stony meteorites are not
recognized unless they are
actually seen to fall or un-
less they land in areas
where surface rocks do not
occur.

The ideal place for a
stony meteorite to land and
be at once detected is on an
extensive ice cap. There,
any rock sitting on top of
an icy thickness of a mile or
more must be a meteorite.
Such objects are most
likely to be found on the
vast Antarctic ice cap, by
far the largest in the world.

In 1969 a group of Japa-
nese geologists came across
nine closely spaced meteor-
ites on the Antarctic ice
cap. These roused the inter-
est of scientists generally,
and thousands of meteoric
fragments have been found
since, which have made it
possible to study the sub-
ject in greater detail. There
is some reason to believe,
from delicate chemical
analyses, that a few frag-
ments may have reached us
from the Moon and some
perhaps even from Mars.
