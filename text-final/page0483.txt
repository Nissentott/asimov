Even unexplained,
however, the photoelectric
effect made it appear that
electrons existed in matter
even when electric currents
were not involved. The fact
that identical electrons
were emitted by various
metals made it seem that
electrons were a constit-
uent of all atoms without
exception.

Kennelly-
Heaviside Layer

The fact that Marconi’s
message, generated in
southwestern England, was
picked up in Newfoundland
(see 1901) presented a puz-
zle. Electromagnetic radia-
tion, including radio waves,
travels in straight lines.
Even if the radio waves
were traveling parallel to
the ground to begin with,
they should have headed off
into outer space as the
Earth'’s surface curved
downward. (Earth is a
sphere, after all.) Instead,
the signal apparently clung
to the neighborhood of
Earth’s surface, working its
way around the Earth’s
spherical curve across the
Atlantic Ocean.

A British-born Ameri-
can electrical engineer, Ar-
thur Edwin Kennelly
(1861-1939), suggested that
there might be a layer of
electric charges in the
upper atmosphere, which

would serve to reflect radio
waves. In that case, the
radio waves would bounce
between earth and clouds,
thus explaining why they
clung to the bulge of the
Earth.

A British electrical en-
gineer, Oliver Heaviside
(1850-1925), independently
advanced the same idea, so
that the supposed layer of
charged particles came to
be called the Kennelly-Hea-
viside layer. It was to be
twenty years before these
speculations were proved
correct.

Stratosphere

Ever since balloons had
been invented (see 1783),
scientists had used them to
explore heights that they
could otherwise reach only
by climbing the highest
mountains. However, by
the time a balloon was 6
miles in the air, the cold
and lack of oxygen could be
fatal.

The French meteorolo-
gist Léon-Philippe Teisser-
enc de Bort (1855-1913)
therefore took to sending
up balloons bearing only in-
struments that could be
read when the balloon re-
turned to Earth.

He found in this way
that the temperature of the
atmosphere dropped stead-
ily up to a height of about 7
miles. At higher altitudes,
the temperature remained

constant as high as he
could reach.

In 1902 Teisserenc de
Bort suggested that the at-
mosphere be divided into
two parts. The lower part,
below the 7-mile mark, had
temperature variations and
therefore produced winds,
clouds, and in short, the
weather changes so famil-
iar to us. This would be
called the troposphere (from
Greek words meaning
“sphere of change”). Above
it would be the constant-
temperature stratosphere
(“sphere of layers,” because
Teisserenc de Bort felt that
constant temperature
meant the gases would lie
in undisturbed layers). The
names have remained with
us ever since.

Symbolic Logic
and
Mathematics

The German mathemati-
cian Gottlob Frege (1848
1925) improved and ex-
tended Boole’s system of
symbolic logic (see 1847).
In fact he spent almost
twenty years putting to-
gether a system of symbolic
logic that would serve as
the basis of all mathemat-
ics, reducing it to complete
rigor by minimizing as-
sumptions and proving
each step.

In 1902, when the sec-
ond volume was in galleys,
