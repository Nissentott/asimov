Syphilis
Ehrlich had won a Nobel
Prize for finding a chemical
that would kill trypano-
somes and might therefore
serve as a cure for sleeping
sickness (see 1907). The
chemical invelved con-
tained nitrogen, and it oc-
curred to Ehrlich that if the
similar but much more poi-
sonous element arsenic
were substituted for the ni-
trogen, it might prove a
more effective chemothera-
peutic agent.

He tried every organic
arsenic compound he could
obtain or synthesize, and
the 606th was a compound
now called arsphenamine. It
did not seem unusually
promising as an agent
against trypanosomes, but
in 1909 an assistant of Ehr-
lich found that it was effec-
tive against spirochetes, the
agents that caused syphilis.

Syphilis had been a
dreaded disease for four
centuries, all the more so
since it was spread by sex-
ual activity so that it was
considered shameful and
could not be mentioned in
polite society. Naturally,
that just multiplied its inci-
dence.

Arsphenamine cut

down the incidence of syph-
ilis by half in England and
France over the next five
years, but bluenoses were
not wanting who thought it
a wicked invention because
it encouraged “immoral-
ity” by lessening the fear of
medical consequences.

Typhus

Typhus, a contagious dis-
ease with a high mortality
rate, periodically struck in
epidemic form.

In Tunis, a French phy-
sician, Charles-Jean-Henri
Nicolle (1866—1936), noted
that typhus was very conta-
gious outside the hospital
but not inside. Something
must happen upon en-
trance to the hospital, and
Nicolle wondered if it
might be the fact that pa-
tients’ clothes were re-
moved and that they were
washed and put into clean
hospital garments.

Nicolle decided that
the contagious agent must
be connected with the old
clothes, and he suspected
the body louse, which ex-
ists everywhere among
human beings where the
chance for frequent wash-
ing of clothes and body
does not exist.

By 1909 he had proved
the case. The body louse, by
biting someone with typhus
and then biting someone
without it, spread the dis-
ease. This meant the dis-
ease could be controlled if
some practical way could
be found of removing the
louse, in societies where for
one reason or another wash-
ing was infrequent. That
was not to come for an-
other third of a century.

Ribose

Kossel had isolated the ni-
trogenous bases of nucleic
acid (see 1885) but had not
been able to go further. It
was clear, though, that ni-
trogenous bases were not
all there was in the mole-
cule.

In 1909 the Russian-
born American chemist
Phoebus Aaron Theodore
Levene (1869—-1940) ex-
tracted a sugar from nu-
cleic acid and identified
it as ribose. It had a five-
carbon molecule. Not all
nucleic acid molecules
possessed it, but those that
did came to be known as ri-
bose nucleic acid, almost in-
variably abbreviated as
RNA.

The sugar, if any, in the
