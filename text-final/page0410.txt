Fertilization

Egg cells and sperm cells
were both known, and it
was clear that the birth of
young required a union of
the two. Nevertheless, such
a union was not observed
until the German embryolo-
gist Oskar Wilhelm August
Hertwig (1849-1922) saw a
sperm cell actually enter
the egg cell of a sea urchin.
What's more, although
sperm cells are produced in
swarming plenty, Hertwig
could see that but a single

 

sperm cell entered the egg
cell and that it sufficed for
fertilization.

Radiometer

In 1875 Crookes (see 1861)
devised the radiometer, con-
sisting of a set of pivoted
vanes in a vacuum. One
side of each vane was black-
ened so that it would ab-
sorb heat, and the other
side was shiny so that it
would reflect it. In the pres-
ence of sunlight, the vanes
turned steadily. This was

not due to solar radiation,
for if the container was
evacuated particularly
well, the motion ceased. Ac-
tually, the air molecules in
the imperfect vacuum re-
bounded from the heated
side more strongly than
from the cooler, shiny side,
thus “kicking” it around.
This required a partial vac-
uum to work, as otherwise
air resistance would muffle
the motion. The radiometer
was only a toy, but it of-
fered vivid support for the
kinetic theory of gases.

Telephone

The telegraph, now over
thirty years old, transmit-
ted only signals. The Brit-
ish-born American inventor
Alexander Graham Bell
(1847-1922) wanted some-

thing better than that. He
wanted to send actual
speech over the wires, by
turning sound waves into a
fluctuating electric current
that waxed and waned as
the sound waves com-
pressed and decompressed

air. The electric current
could then be reconverted
into sound at the other end.
He finally invented a
device capable of doing
that and first made use of it
accidentally. He had spilled
battery acid on his pants
