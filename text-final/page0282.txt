ously suited to laboratory
equipment if only it could
be easily worked and
pounded into shape. A
method for doing so was
worked out by a British
chemist, William Hyde
Wollaston (1766-1828), in

1801

1800. He kept his method
secret and never allowed
anyone in his laboratory. In
this way he earned a for-
tune. He arranged to have
his method published after
his death.

In working with plati-

num, he discovered two
other metals very similar in
properties to it. These were
palladium and rhodium.

 

 

 

Jacquard Loom

To weave textiles in such a
way as to introduce pat-
terns would ordinarily re-
quire people to work in a
careful manner, producing
certain motions here, but
not there. It is not the sort
of thing that one might
think could be done by
machinery. A machine

wouldn't have the “brains”

to do what human beings
do only with difficulty.
In 1801, however, a

French inventor, Joseph-
Marie Jacquard (1752—
1834), invented what came
to be called the Jacquard
loom. In such a loom, nee-
dles ordinarily move
through holes set up in a
block of wood. Suppose a
card containing holes in a
certain pattern is inter-
posed between the needles
and the holes in the wood.
Where there are holes in
the card matching the holes
in the wood, the needles
pass through; otherwise,

the needles are stopped. In
this way, a card might en-
force, quite automatically,
just the type of needle mo-
tions that would produce a
pattern. Different cards
would produce different
patterns.

To be sure, devising the
punched card required con-
siderable intelligence and
ingenuity in the first place,
but once the cards were de-
signed and in place, the ma-
chine did not need brains;
it worked automatically.
