In 1913 he found that
heat was not developed nor
was oxygen consumed dur-
ing muscular contraction,
but that both took place
after contraction when the
muscle was at rest.

The German biochem-
ist Otto Meyerhof (1884—
1951) independently dem-
onstrated the same fact in
chemical terms. While the
muscle is contracting, gly-

cogen disappears and lactic
acid appears. Six-carbon
units, in other words, are
split into three-carbon
units without the consump-
tion of oxygen or the devel-
opment of heat. Eventually,
accumulating lactic acid
prevents further muscular
contraction. (We feel worn
out.) After the contraction,
lactic acid is oxidized (con-
suming oxygen and devel-

oping heat), thus paying off
the oxygen debt that piled
up during the preceding re-
action (anaerobic glycolysis,
Greek for “‘sugar-splitting
without air”).

As a result of this work,
Hill and Meyerhof were
awarded shares of the
Nobel Prize for medicine
and physiology in 1922.

 

 

Atomic Number

Once Laue had shown that
X rays could be diffracted
by crystals (see 1912) and
Barkla had shown that ele-
ments could be made to
emit characteristic X rays
(see 1906), it became pos-
sible to measure the
wavelengths of those char-

 

 

acteristic X rays precisely
by crystal diffraction.

This work was done by
the British physicist Henry
Gwyn Jeffreys Moseley
(1887—1915), who com-
pleted it in 1914. He
showed that the character-
istic X rays decreased in
wavelength and increased
in frequency with the in-

 
  

 

creasing weight of the ele-
ments emitting them. This
Moseley attributed to the
increasing positive charge
on the atomic nucleus as
the atomic weight of the ele-
ment increased.

This discovery led to a
major improvement of Men-
deleyev’s periodic table (see
1869). Mendeleyey had ar-
