crust as a result. He found
that waves that penetrated
deeper into the Earth ar-
rived sooner than waves
traveling along the surface.

Mohorovi¢i¢ main-
tained that the Earth's out-
ermost crust rested on a
layer that was more rigid
and in which earthquake
waves therefore traveled
more quickly. Furthermore,
the separation between the
two layers did not seem to
be gradual but sharp. It
was a discontinuity and
came to be known as the
Mohorovici¢ discontinuity.

This was the first indi-
cation that the Earth was
composed of more than one
layer, with widely different
properties.

 

North Pole

Ever since the search for
the Northwest Passage had
begun, some three and a

half centuries before, the
North Pole had been a dis-
tant goal for explorers, but
the ice defeated everyone
until the early years of the
twentieth century.

The American explorer
Robert Edwin Peary (1856—
1920) made it his goal. Be-
ginning in 1886, he began a
detailed exploration of
Greenland and in 1891 ex-
plored its northern coast
(relatively ice-free and still
called Peary Land in his
honor). He proved that
Greenland was an island
that did not extend to the
North Pole, although the
northernmost bit of Green-
land is closer to the pole
than any other land area.

In 1909 Peary orga-
nized an elaborate travel
party, of which successive
members were to turn back
at periodic intervals until
at the end only Peary and
his black associate, Mat-

thew Alexander Henson
(1866—1955), reached the
North Pole in a final dash
on April 6, 1909.

There was some contro-
versy over this. An erst-
while associate of Peary'’s,
Frederick Albert Cook
(1865—1940), claimed to
have reached the Pole in
1908. The controversy has
never been settled and per-
haps never will be, but the
general opinion is that it
was Peary who first at-
tained the goal.

Neon Lights

Beginning in 1910, the
Erench chemist Georges

Claude (1870-1960) showed
that electric discharges
through the noble gases
could be made to produce

light. Most spectacular was
the red light produced in
this manner by neon, so
