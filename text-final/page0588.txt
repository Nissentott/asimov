o
Synthetic
Vitamin C
King and Szent-Gyérgyi
had succeeded in determin-
ing the molecular structure
of vitamin C (see 1932).

In 1933 the Polish-born
Swiss chemist Tadeus Re-
ichstein (b. 1897) succeeded
in synthesizing the vitamin.
Eventually other vitamins
were analyzed and then
synthesized. This meant
that it was no longer neces-
sary to obtain small quanti-
ties of vitamins from huge
quantities of foodstuff. In-
stead they could be synthe-
sized in the laboratory by
the pound and even by the
ton. Nor were the synthetic
vitamins in any way dif-
ferent from the natural
ones.

The ability to synthe-
size vitamins led to the de-
velopment and popularity
of vitamin pills, and when
these became available at
affordable prices, the nutri-
tional problem of vitamins
in the diet was diminished
or even abolished.

The English chemist
Walter Norman Haworth
(1883—1950) independently
synthesized vitamin C not
long after Reichstein did,

and it was Haworth who
gave the vitamin the name
of ascorbic acid. For Haw-
orth’s work on sugars gener-
ally, he was awarded a
share in the Nobel Prize for
chemistry in 1937,

Molecular
Beams

If gases are allowed to es-
cape from a container
through a tiny hole into a
high vacuum, the escaping
molecules meet virtually no
molecules with which they
can collide. They therefore
form a tight beam of mov-
ing particles. These molecu-
lar beams are made up of
particles that are neutral
but that are themselves
made up of charged parti-
cles: nuclei and electrons.

As a result, in accor-
dance with Maxwell's equa-
tions (see 1865), they ought
to behave like tiny mag-
nets.

The German-born
American physicist Otto
Stern (1888-1969) studied
these molecular beams for
years and by 1933 had con-
clusively demonstrated
that they did behave like
magnets and in ways, more-
over, that also supported

quantum mechanics. Fur-
thermore, Stern showed
that the molecular beams
possessed wave aspects.

For his work on molec-
ular beams, Stern was
awarded the Nobel Prize
for physics in 1943.

Approach to
Absolute Zero

Debye and Giauque had
suggested a way of ap-
proaching absolute zero
more closely by using
magnetic techniques (see
1925).

In 1933 Giauque man-
aged to turn theory into
practice. He imposed a
magnetic field on gadolin-
ium sulfate, then let it re-
treat into disorder on the
removal of the field. The re-
treat into disorder required
heat and absorbed it from
the surrounding helium. In
this way he lowered its tem-
perature to 0.25 degrees
above absolute zero. By the
end of a year, others using
the same technique had
reached 0.0185° K.

For this and for later
work on ultracold tempera-
tures, Giaugque was
awarded the Nobel Prize
for chemistry in 1949.
