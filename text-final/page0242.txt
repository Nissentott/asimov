Soluble Gases

Priestley (see 1768) was the
first to bubble gases into an
upside-down mercury-filled
vessel with its mouth in a

tub of mercury. In this way,
gases could be collected
that could not be collected
through water because they
dissolve in the water. By
1770 Priestley had collected

and studied the water-solu-
ble gases we know as am-
monia, sulfur dioxide, and
hydrogen chloride.

Nebulas

The hungry search for com-
ets became so important to
some astronomers that it
seemed to consume them.
One such was the French as-
tronomer Charles Messier
(1730-1817), who discov-
ered twenty-one comets,
but who was depressed
whenever some other as-
tronomer discovered one he
had missed, or when he
was kept away from his
telescope as, for instance,
when his wife was on her
deathbed.

He was irritated by the
false hopes aroused by the
sighting of some fuzzy ob-
ject that turned out not to
be a comet but a nebulosity
fixed to some spot in the

heavens. In 1771 he pub-
lished a list of 45 of these
nebulas, which in later
years he expanded

to 103.

As it turned out, the
list of Messier objects
turned out to be far
grander and more im-
portant than comets, and
Messier would be com-
pletely forgotten now if his
comet discoveries were his
only accomplishment. It is
his list of things to be disre-
garded that has made his
name immortal, for it in-
cludes numerous star clus-
ters and distant galaxies.

Plants and
Carbon Dioxide

Carbon dioxide was well
known by this time to sup- l
port neither combustion
nor animal life. Priestley
(see 1768) thought of check-
ing to see whether plants,
as well as animals, were un-
able to live in carbon diox-
ide.
In 1771 he placed a lit
candle in an enclosed vol-
ume of air until the candle
would burn no more and
the air was filled with car-
bon dioxide. He then
placed a sprig of mint in a
glass of water and placed it
in the enclosed air.
The plant did not die.
It lived there for months
