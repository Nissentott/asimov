cloud layer would probably
reflect much of the Sun's ra-
diation. Furthermore, the
cloud layer seemed to
imply that Venus had a
great deal of water, which
might further moderate the
weather, so that on the
whole, Venus was thought
to be a quite comfortable
world.

However, every object
gives off microwaves; the
higher the temperature of
the object, the shorter the
wavelength of these micro-
waves. Onee radio astron-
omy was developed, radio
telescopes became delicate
enough to detect micro-
waves being emitted by the
planets.

In 1956 a team of Amer-
ican astronomers headed
by Cornell H. Mayer stud-
ied the microwaves emitted
by Venus's dark side. Their
nature made it clear that
something on Venus, either
its surface or some layer in
its atmosphere, was at a
temperature far above the
boiling point of water. The
vision of Venus as a com-
fortable world was thus
rudely shaken and was
eventually destroyed.

Ribosomes

Once the electron micro-
scope was turned upon the
cell, far greater detail could

be made out than had ever
been seen before (see 1932).
For instance, there were nu-
merous small bodies, which
were called microsontes
(small bodies), distributed
through the cytoplasm of
the cell. The Romanian-
born American physiologist
George Emil Palade (b.
1912) studied them care-
fully by electron micro-
scope and found they were
not merely mitochondrial
fragments, as some had
thought, but independent
bodies with a chemical
composition quite different
from that of mitochondria.

By 1956 Palade had
shown that microsomes
were rich in RNA (ribo-
nucleic acid), and they
were therefore renamed ri-
bosomes. It was quickly re-
alized that the ribosomes
were the site of protein
manufacture within the
cell.

For this work, Palade
was awarded a share of the
Nobel Prize for physiology
and medicine in 1974.

Transfer RNA

In 1956 the American bio-
chemist Mahlon Bush
Hoagland (b. 1921) discov-
ered relatively small mole-
cules of RNA in the
cytoplasm. These came in
different varieties, and
Hoagland showed that each

variety had the capacity to
combine with a particular
amino acid.

At the other end, the
RNA molecule could com-
bine with a particular spot
on a ribosome. Once the
RNA molecules were lined
up properly, the amino
acids at the other end of
each would be lined up
properly too and could eas-
ily combine to form particu-
lar proteins. Since these
RNA molecules transferred
the information from the ri-
bosomes to the proteins,
they were called transfer
RNA.

But how did the trans-
fer RNA manage to take up
its positions to form the
proper proteins? The DNA
molecules in the chromo-
somes, which carried the in-
formation from parent to
offspring, were buried deep
in the cell nucleus, while
the transfer RNA was in the
cytoplasm.

As it happens, the nu-
cleus contains RNA mole-
cules also. Two French
biologists, Jacques-Lucien
Monod (1910-1976) and
Francois Jacob (b. 1920),
suggested that the informa-
tion on the DNA molecule
was transferred to an RNA
molecule that had used one
of the DNA strands as a
model in its formation.
These RNA molecules
carried the information
