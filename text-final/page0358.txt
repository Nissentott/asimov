Symbolic Logic

Much of Aristotle’s science
had been superseded dur-
ing the three centuries
since Copernicus, but his
analysis of logic remained
supreme. Even here, how-
ever, advances were finally
being made.

The English mathema-
tician George Boole (1815—
1864) tried to mathe-

maticize logical arguments.

Attempts had already been
made in this direction, no-
tably by Leibniz (see 1669).
It was Boole, however, who
carried it through success-
fully. He applied a set of
symbols to logical opera-
tions, choosing both sym-
bols and operations so that
they would resemble those
of algebra, and showed that
by algebralike manipula-
tions, the symbols could be
made to yield logical re-
sults.

In 1847 he published
The Mathematical Analysis
of Logic, thus founding
what might be called Bool-

ean algebra or symbolic
logic. This was later to be of
much use in studying the
rigorous foundations of
mathematics and, eventu-
ally, in programming com-
puters.

Silver Fillings

The American dentist
Thomas Wiltberger Evans
(1823-1897), who emi-
grated to France about
1847, introduced the use of
silver amalgam for fillings
in teeth whose decayed por-
tions had been drilled
away.

Absolute Zero

The work of Amagat (see
1699), on the steady de-
crease in the volume of
gases with temperature,
gave rise to the suspicion
that there might be a tem-
perature—an absolute zero

—at which gas volume de-
clined to zero. On the other
hand, the volume decrease
might lose validity once all
gases were liquefied, and
temperatures might there-
after be lowered indefi-
nitely.

The British physicist

William Thomson, later

Baron Kelvin (1824-1907),
pointed out in 1848 that it

was not volume loss that

was crucial, but energy i
loss; that energy loss af- i
fected all matter, liquids

and solids as well as gases; ‘
and that the rate of loss !
