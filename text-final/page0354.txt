that some asymmetry in
the system brought about
the twisting. This seemed
more likely to be true when
it was found that some sam-
ples of a particular sub-
stance twisted polarized
light clockwise, while other
samples of the same sub-
stance twisted it counter-
clockwise.

Starting in 1846, a
French chemist, Louis
Pasteur (1822-1895), began
his search for the possible
asymmetries. He worked
with small erystals of sub-
stances called rartrates, He
studied them under the mi-
croscope and found that the
crystals were rather subtly
asymmetric, with one par-
ticular little facet on one
side but not on the other.
What's more, some crystals
had the facet on the left
side, while others had it on
the right side, so that the
two varieties were mirror
images of each other.

These crystals had
been obtained from a solu-
tion that had no effect on
polarized light, and Pasteur
suspected that one type of
crystal produced one type
of twist while the other pro-
duced the opposite type,
the two together canceling
each other. To check this,
Pasteur separated the crys-
tals painstakingly with
tweezers, putting all the
lefts to one side and all the

 

rights to another. He dis-
solved them separately,
and sure enough, one solu-
tion twisted the polarized
light clockwise and the
other, counterclockwise.

Crystal asymmetry
could be one reason for this
optical activity, but it could
not be the sole reason. After
all, the solution twisted the
plane of polarized light
when the crystals were dis-
solved and gone. There had
to be a more deep-seated
asymmetry present, but it
took another quarter-cen-
tury before that was discov-
ered.

Protoplasm

A German botanist, Hugo
von Mohl (1805-1872),
studied plant cells assidu-
ously. He found that the
typical plant cell had a wa-
tery sap in the center,
which showed no signs of
life, and a granular colloi-
dal layer rimming the cell,
which did show such signs.
In 1846 Mohl called this
granular colloidal material
protoplasmt.

The word had been
used earlier in another con-
nection. The Czech physiol-
ogist Jan Evangelista
Purkyiné (1787-1869) had
applied the word to the
speck of living embryonic
material in the egg, which
was immersed in nonliving
yolk that acted as its initial

food supply. Protoplasm is
from Greek words meaning
“first formed,"” and thus re-
ferred to the living part of
the egg as the first-formed
part of the organism.
However, it was Mohl's
more general use that
caused the word to enter
the scientific vocabulary.

Cuneiform

High on a cliff in the town
of Bisitun in Persia is an in-
scription placed there by
Darius the Great of Persia.
He had achieved the throne
in a dubious manner, per-
haps by arranging the as-
sassination of his
predecessor. Therefore it
was to his advantage to
make the people of his em-
pire think he was a legiti-
mate ruler, and the
inscription describes his
version of his accession to
the throne at a conspicuous
height so that as many peo-
ple as possible could see it.
(That was the nearest an an-
cient could get to a televi-
sion speech in prime time.)
To make sure that as many
of his subjects as possible
understood the message, he
had it inscribed in Persian,
Assyrian, and Elamitic.

In 1846 a British ar-
chaeologist, Henry Cres-
wicke Rawlinson (1810—
1895), managed to work his
way through the Persian bu-
reaucracy and gain permis-
