which look like the grooves
on a phonograph record. In
places, dark streaks show
up at right angles to the
ringlets, like spokes on a
wheel. Then too, a faint out-
ermost ring seems to con-
sist of three intertwined
ringlets. None of this can
be explained so far. It may
be that a straightforward
gravitational situation is
being complicated by elec-
tromagnetic effects.

Neutrino Mass

In 1980 Frederick Reines
(see 1956) reported on ex-
periments that indicated
neutrinos might have tiny
quantities of mass (for
years they had been
thought to be massless).

Researchers in Moscow
reported similar results in
an entirely different experi-
ment and thought the neu-
trino mass might be
1/13,000 of an electron.

If this were so, then

the three neutrinos—the
electron-neutrino, the
muon-neutrino, and

the tauon-neutrino—might
well have slightly different
masses and be capable of
oscillating; that is, of con-
tinually changing from one
to another.

If this were so, it would
explain the fact that the
Sun seems to emit only
one-third the number of
neutrinos it ought to. It
should be emitting elec-
tron-neutrinos only, and de-
tecting devices would only
pick up electron-neutrinos.,
But if the neutrinos oscil-
lated, the electron-neutri-
nos emitted by the Sun
might change into muon-
neutrinos and tauon-neutri-
nos en route to Earth and
arrive here in equal quanti-
ties. The detecting devices
would then pick up only
the one-third that were elec-

tron-neutrinos.
Then, too, even if the
neutrinos had only a tiny

nass, lh\ilf were so many
neutrinos in the Universe
that their total mass might
make up a hundred times
as much mass as every-
thing else put together. The
presence of this mass, ig-
nored until now by astrono-
mers, might explain how
galaxies rotate, how clus-
ters of galaxies hang to-
gether, and how the
galaxies formed in the first
place. All these things
would make sense if the
“mystery of the missing
mass’ were solved by at-
tributing it to neutrinos.

Furthermore, the pres-
ence of missing mass in the
form of neutrinos would be
just sufficient to close the
Universe; that is, to make
certain that the Universe
would someday begin to
contract again.

The only trouble with
all this is that the question
of the neutrino’s mass has
not yet been confirmed, and
it may well be a false alarm.
