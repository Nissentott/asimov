 

therefore maintained that
light was a form of electro-
magnetic radiation and
that the wavelengths of
such radiation depended on
the oscillation rate of the
charge and could be any-
thing—far shorter than the
ultraviolet and far longer
than the infrared, for exam-
ple. (Two decades later,
this view was to be con-
firmed.)

In this way, Maxwell
brought about the first uni-
fication in physics, or the
first bringing under the um-
brella of a single set of
mathematical relation-
ships such apparently dis-
parate phenomena as
electricity, magnetism, and
light. Further unifications
of this sort were to involve
major efforts by later physi-
cists.

Mobius Strip
In 1865 the German mathe-
matician August Ferdinand
Maobius (1790—1868) pre-
sented what came to be
called a Mobius strip. This
is a long, flat strip of paper
(or other flexible material)
that is given a half twist
and the two ends then
pasted together to give a
circular figure. The re-
sulting construction has
but one edge and one side.
This made Mobius one
of the founders of topology,
the branch of mathematics
that deals with those prop-

  

erties of figures that are not
altered by deformations (as
long as there is no tearing).

Cylinder Locks

Human behavior being
what it is, there has always
been a demand for locks. A
lock becomes more useful if
it is small and not easily
picked; if the key is small
and not easily duplicated.
No lock can be perfect, but
some are obviously better
than others.

In 1865 an American

 

 

locksmith, Linus Yale
(1821-1868), patented a cyl-
inder lock with tumblers
that had to be brought into
a certain alignment if the
lock was to open. The key
had a serrated edge that suf-
ficed to bring the tumblers
into line. A vast number of
combinations were possi-
ble, so that every key could
be unique, even if there
were millions of locks. The
ar locks and keys that
ontrolled house and
apartment doors ever since
are based on this principle.
