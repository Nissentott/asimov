(Mathematical Principles of
Natural Philosophy), often
known simply as the Prin-
cipia. It was written in
Latin and did not appear in
English until 1729.Tt is gen-
erally considered the great-
est science book ever
written.

Despite the greatness
of the book, Newton had
trouble publishing it.
Hooke was unalterably op-
posed, and the Royal Soci-
ety hesitated to become
involved in the controversy.
Fortunately, Halley had in-
herited a fortune in 1684,
when his father was mur-
dered by unknown assail-
ants. He saw to the
proofreading of the book
and had it published at his
OWN expense.

In the book, Newton
codified Galileo’s findings
concerning falling bodies
(see 1589) into the three
laws of motion.

The first enunciated
the principle of inertia: A
body at rest remains at rest
and a body in motion
remains in motion at a con-
stant velocity (that is, con-
stant speed in a constant di-
rection) as long as outside
forces are not involved.

The second law of mo-
tion defines force as the
product of mass and accel-
eration. This was the first
clear distinction between
the mass of a body (repre-
senting its resistance to ac-

celeration) and its weight
(representing the extent to
which it is acted on by a
gravitational force),

The third law of mo-
tion states that for every ac-
tion there is an equal and
opposite reaction.

These laws of motion
are equivalent to the
axioms and postulates with
which Euclid began his
treatment of geometry,
From the axioms and postu-
lates, an incredible number
of theorems can be derived,
each one building on theo-
rems that went before. In
the same way, from the
laws of motion, an enor-
mous number of mechani-
cal effects can be deduced.

Universal
Gravitation

From the laws of motion,
Newton was able to deduce
the manner in which the
gravitational force of at-
traction between the Earth
and the Moon could be cal-
culated. He showed that it
was directly proportional
to the product of the
masses of the two bodies
and inversely proportional
to the square of the dis-
tance between their cen-
ters. The proportionality
could be made an equality
by the introduction of a con-
stant. In other words:

F = gmm'/d?
where g is the gravitational

constant, m and m' are the
masses of the Earth and the
Moon, d is the distance be-
tween their centers, and F
is the force of gravitational
attraction between them.
Most important of all,
Newton postulated that
this law of gravitational at-
traction held not only be-
tween the Earth and the
Moon, but between any two
bodies at all throughout the
Universe. It was not merely
gravitation he was speak-
ing of, but universal gravita-
tion. This was another
claim that the laws of na-
ture were the same every-
where and the mightiest
blow yet against the view
that the heavenly bodies
worked by some set of natu-
ral laws other than those
that prevailed on Earth.
From this rather sim-
ple law of universal gravita-
tion, all of Kepler’s laws of
planetary motion could be
derived. It accounted for all
the irregularities of plane-
tary motion known in New-
ton'’s time, for while the
Sun was the predominant
attractive body, the planets
had minor attractions for
each other that resulted in
slight alterations (perturba-
tions) of their orbits from
what they would be if the
Sun alone were involved.
What Newton had done
was to describe the machin-
ery of the Universe effec-
tively and to show that it
was essentially simple. De-
