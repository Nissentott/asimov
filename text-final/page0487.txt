continuing to pretend that
the atom was a featureless,
indivisible particle. It had
to have a structure involv-
ing electrons, and the first
to speculate on that struc-
ture was Thomson, who
had discovered the electron
(see 1897).

In 1904 he suggested
that the atom was posi-
tively charged electricity in
which negatively charged
electrons were embedded
(like raisins in a pound
cake) in just sufficient quan-
tity to neutralize the posi-
tive charge. Naturally,
under stress, such as that
produced by electric cur-
rents or light, the electrons
could be jarred loose from
the atom.

The suggestion was in-
teresting but quickly
proved inadequate. How-
ever, it did set people to
thinking seriously about
atomic structure.

Coenzyme

Once Buchner had shown
that yeast enzyme could be
extracted from yeast and
still be active (see 1896), it
became a popular sub-
stance for experimentation.
In 1904 the British bio-
chemist Arthur Harden
(1865—1940) placed an ex-
tract of yeast in a bag made
of a semipermeable mem-
brane (see 1748) in order to
dialyze the extract and re-

move any small molecules
that might be present.

Harden found to his
surprise that when he did
this, the material left be-
hind in the bag lost its ac-
tivity—it no longer
fermented sugar. Did the
enzyme have so small a mo-
lecular size that it passed
through the semipermeable
membrane? No, for the ma-
terial outside the bag
showed no activity either.
However, if the material
outside the bag was poured
back into the bag, the com-
bined mixture showed en-
zyme activity.

Harden concluded that
an enzyme might consist of
two parts, a large part that
could not go through the
semipermeable membrane
and a small part that could
and was so loosely held
that it easily broke away
and did go through the
membrane,

The material that re-
mained inside the bag, if it
was boiled, did not regain
activity when the material
outside the bag was added.
If the material outside the
bag was boiled, it could
still restore activity if
added to unboiled material
inside the bag. The conclu-
sion was that the large mol-
ecule was a protein, since
protein molecules are rou-
tinely destroyed by boiling.
The small molecule was
not.

Harden called the
small molecule a coenzyme,
and the name came to be
applied to any nonprotein
structure of relatively small
size that proves essential to
the activity of an enzyme.
Not all enzymes require co-
enzymes, but coenzymes,
when they do exist, eventu-
ally explained a great deal
about the workings of en-
zymes and the require-
ments of diet.

Organic Tracers

The body is a “black box."”
We know what goes in, in
the way of food and air; we
know what comes out, in
the way of waste products.
But what happens in be-
tween? All the changes
from beginning to end are
referred to as metabolism.
Those changes that are hid-
den inside the body are
called intermediary metabo-
lism.

In 1904 a German bio-
chemist, Franz Knoop
(1875—1946), tried an inge-
nious trick that he thought
might give some hint of
what went on inside the
body. He attached benzene
rings to the long carbon
chains of the fatty acids
that make up fats. The ben-
zene ring is not easily de-
stroyed in the body, and
Knoop expected it to show
up in the urine.

Knoop found that if the
