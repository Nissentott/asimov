Analytic
Geometry

The French mathematician
René Descartes (1596—
1650) published, in 1637,
his Discours de la méthode
(Discussions on the Method)
—of finding scientific

truth by good reasoning,
that is.

In a hundred-page ap-
pendix to this book, Des-
cartes combined algebra
and geometry. He pointed
out that if one drew two
perpendicular straight
lines, marked the intersec-
tion 0, and laid off units on
each line, positive numbers
to the right and up, nega-
tive numbers to the left and
down, then every point in
the plane could be repre-
sented by two numbers,
one for its position along
the horizontal axis and the

second for its position
along the vertical axis.
(One could add a third axis,
in and out, and locate every
point in the Universe by
three numbers.)

Straight lines and
curves could then be ex-
pressed by algebraic equa-
tions, which would locate
every point on the line or
curve with reference to the
two axes. This combination
of disciplines, producing
analytic geometry, strength-
ened both. Geometric prob-
lems could be solved
algebraically, and algebraic
equations could be illus-
trated geometrically.

It also laid the founda-
tion for the development of
the calculus, which is essen-
tially the application of al-
gebra to smoothly changing
phenomena that can be rep-
resented geometrically by
curves of various sorts.

Fermat’'s Last
Theorem

The French mathematician
Pierre de Fermat (1601 —
1665) had a bad habit of
not publishing but of scrib-
bling hasty notes in mar-
gins of books or of writing
casually about his discover-
ies in letters to his friends.
The result is that even
though he understood ana-
lytic geometry before Des-
cartes, he loses the credit.

Here is something that
involved him.

It is possible to have
two squares that add up to
a third square: 32 + 42 =
52,0r9 + 16 = 25. There
are an infinite number of
such cases. Are there, how-
ever, two cubes that add up
to a third cube, or two
fourth powers that add up
to a fourth power, and so on?
