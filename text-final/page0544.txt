Milankovich's sugges-

time, but after more than
half a century, it came to
be considered seriously.

Anemia

Anemia, from Greek words
meaning “no blood,” is the
name of a family of diseases
in which the blood per-
forms its functions with
less than normal efficiency.
One common reason for
anemia is a lack of iron in
the diet. This reduces the
level of hemoglobin in the
blood and makes the red
corpuscles less efficient at
picking up oxygen from the
lungs. Such anemics are
pale and easily tired.

The American patholo-
gist George Hoyt Whipple
(1878-1976) induced an ar-
tificial anemia in dogs by
bleeding them, then fol-
lowed the manner in which
new red blood corpuscles
were formed. He kept the
dogs on various kinds of
diets to see what effect
would be produced on cor-
puscle formation and found
that, of the various food-
stuffs he tried, liver was the
most potent in correcting
such anemia. This eventu-
ally led the way to the cure
for a kind of anemia much
more dangerous than
simple iron-deficiency
anemia.

For this reason, Whip-
ple was awarded a share of
the Nobel Prize for medi-
cine and physiology in
1934.

Air Masses

A father-and-son team of
meteorologists, Vilhelm Fri-
man Koren Bjerknes (1862—
1951) and Jacob Aall
Bonnevie Bjerknes (1897—
1975), had set up weather-
observing stations all over
Norway during World War 1.

By 1920 they had
shown that the atmosphere
is made up of large air
masses and that there is a
sharp differentiation in
temperature between warm
tropical air masses and cold
polar air masses. The sharp
boundaries between them
they called fronts, from an
analogy to the battle lines
that had so preoccupied
Europe in recent years.

This simplified the
technique of weather pre-
diction.
