Earth as Magnet

Although the compass had
been known for nearly five
centuries, no one knew why
it pointed north. The En-
glish physician and physi-
cist William Gilbert (1544~
1603) put it to the test and
published a book, De Mag-
nete (Concerning Magnets),
in 1600 in which he de-
scribed his experiments.
For instance, he tested
the general opinion that
garlic would destroy mag-
netism and that diamonds
would produce it. He
rubbed magnets with garlic

 

 

 

and the magnetism did not
disappear. He rubbed un-
magnetized iron with dia-
monds and magnetism did
not appear. He took the pre-
caution of doing this before
witnesses.

The most important
thing he did, however, was
to take a large piece of load-
stone and fashion a globe
out of it. He located its mag-
netic poles and showed that
a compass needle would
point north if placed near
the surface of this spherical
magnet.

What’s more, if he ar-
ranged for the compass nee-

dle to swivel vertically, it
showed what was called
magnetic dip, for it pointed
straight through the body
of the object. In fact, if the
compass needle was held
above the magnetic pole, it
pointed straight down.
(Magnetic dip was first
noted on Earth'’s surface by
an English navigator, Rob-
ert Norman [1560-?], in
1576.)

Gilbert concluded,
then, that compass needles
acted the way they did be-
cause Earth itself was a
huge magnet.
