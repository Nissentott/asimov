Nuclear Atom

For some years, Rutherford
had been firing alpha parti-
cles at sheets of matter (see
1906), thinking that even if
they could penetrate the
matter, they might be de-
flected and scattered by the
atoms making it up. From
the manner of the deflec-
tion, Rutherford hoped to
gain some knowledge of
atomic structure.

In 1908, for instance,
he fired alpha particles at a
sheet of gold only 1/50,000
of an inch thick. Most of the
alpha particles passed
through, unaffected and un-
deflected, recording them-
selves on the photographic
plate behind.

Since the gold repre-
sented a barrier that was
two thousand atoms thick,
the fact that alpha particles
could pass through them
all as though there were
nothing there seemed to
mean that atoms were
mostly empty space. Yet
some alpha particles were
deflected, and struck the
photographic plate some
distance away from the cen-
tral spot formed by the

main stream of alpha parti-
cles. Some were deflected
through quite an angle.

This meant that part of
the atom contained consid-
erable mass. From the fact
that so few alpha particles
were deflected, it could be
concluded that the part
with the mass must make
up a very small fraction of
the atom.

By 1911 Rutherford
had gathered enough evi-
dence to put forward his
theory of the nuclear atom.
The atom, it would seem,
has virtually all its mass
squeezed into a tiny, posi-
tively charged atomic nu-
cleus (which we now know
is only 1/100,000 the diame-
ter of the atom). The outer
regions of the atom contain
enough electrons, each with
a unit negative charge, to
neutralize the nuclear
charge and leave the atom
as a whole electrically neu-
tral.

This theory was
adopted quickly, for it an-
swered major questions.
For example, the relation-
ship between alpha parti-
cles and helium was now
understood. The alpha par-

ticles were helium nuclei,
not helium atoms. This ac-
counted for the electric
charge of the alpha particle
and, thanks to its sub-
atomic size, for its penetrat-
ing power.

Cloud Chamber

Since the discovery of ra-
dioactivity by Becquerel
(see 1896), the use of speed-
ing subatomic particles had
been increasing. This made
it important to have de-
vices that could yield infor-
mation concerning them.
The Geiger counter (see
1908) could detect their
presence, but more was
needed.

A Scottish physicist,
Charles Thomson Rees Wil-
son (1869-1959), had been
studying clouds and la-
bored to produce small arti-
ficial clouds in the
laboratory that he could
also study

In 1896 he had allowed
moist air to expand within
a container so that the
expansion lowered the tem-
perature and not all the
moisture could be retained,
the excess coming out as
