of cosmic ray collisions, a
subatomic particle that
was more massive than a
proton or a neutron, This
came to be called a lambda
particle. It was 1.2 times as
massive as a proton.

Other particles more
massive than a proton were
eventually discovered and
called hyperons. Mesons,
nucleons (protons and neu-
trons), and hyperons were
all grouped together as
hadrons, from a Greek
word meaning “thick” or
“strong,” since they were
all subject to the strong
interaction. Electrons,
muons, and neutrinos, sub-
ject to the weak interac-
tion, were called leptons,
from a Greek word mean-
ing “weak.”

While the number of
leptons remained small, the
number of hadrons rose
steeply as the years passed,
in the end reaching about a
hundred. It was this that
convinced physicists their
notions of subatomic struc-
ture were incomplete; the
large number of hadrons
was too complicated a fac-
tor. There had to be some
new view that would sim-
plify the matter.

Origin of Life
Evidence of living things,
in the form of traces of tiny

bacterial cells, has been
found in rocks that are 3.5

billion years old. Since the
Earth is 4.6 billion years
old, this means that in the
first billion years of Earth’s
existence, living things
must have evolved from
nonliving chemicals. Pre-
sumably, they must have
evolved from the molecules
that made up the huge neb-
ula of dust and gas out of
which the Solar System
was formed.

It is reasonably well es-
tablished that the Universe
is 99 percent hydrogen and
helium in a 9-to-1 ratio,
with oxygen, carbon, nitro-
gen, neon, sulfur, silicon,
iron, and argon most im-
portant among the final 1
percent. Of these, helium,
neon, and argon form no
compounds. In the presence
of a preponderance of hy-
drogen, the oxygen, carbon,
nitrogen, and sulfur form
water, methane, ammonia,
and hydrogen sulfide re-
spectively. Silicon com-
bines with oxygen and
various metals to form sili-
cates, which are rocky sub-
stances, while iron mixes
with other less common
metals.

Earth therefore began
with a core of nickel-iron,
surrounded by a rocky man-
tle and crust. All of that
was topped by an ocean of
water and an atmosphere
that may have consisted of
ammonia, methane, and hy-
drogen sulfide (with some

of each dissolved in the
water). The simple com-
pounds in the atmosphere
and ocean would have been
subjected to the energy of
the Sun’s radiation and,
through the addition of
such energy, might have
built up very gradually
into more complicated
substances until objects
complex enough to be
considered alive were the
result.

In 1952 the American
chemist Stanley Lloyd
Miller (b. 1930), working
under Harold Urey (see
1931), attempted for the
first time to check this pos-
sibility by experimentation.

Miller began with care-
fully purified and sterilized
water and added an “atmo-
sphere” of hydrogen, am-
monia, and methane. He
circulated this through his
apparatus and past an elec-
tric discharge that would
add energy. He kept this up
for a week. He then ana-
lyzed the solution and
found organic compounds
and even a few of the sim-
pler amino acids formed
abiogenetically, that is,
without the presence of life.

Others later continued
the work, using other
sources of energy and other
mixtures of simple com-
pounds. They also added to
the mix more complex com-
pounds that had been
formed in other experi-
