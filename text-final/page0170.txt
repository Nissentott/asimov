group of gods called
Titans).

That same year, he dis-

covered that the middle
star of Orion’s sword was
not a star but a cloud of
luminous gas. It is now
known as the Orion nebula.

Pendulum
Clock

Up to this time, the best
timepieces were still the
mechanical clocks of medi-
eval days that could not
keep time to better than a
large fraction of an hour.

Galileo's discovery of
the principle of the pendu-
lum did not help immedi-
ately. An ordinary
pendulum swings in the arc
of a circle, and when it does
that it doesn’t have a con-
stant period. The period be-
comes a little longer
through a wide arc than
through a narrow one.

If the pendulum could
swing through a cycloid
(very like a circle over a
small arc), then the period
would remain truly con-
stant, Huygens (see above)
showed how to arrange
matters so that the pendu-

lum would swing through a
cycloid. He then hooked it
up to falling weights in
such a way that the pendu-
lum controlled the rate at
which the weights fell and
made it truly constant.

In 1656 Huygens had
the first pendulum clock (or
as it is sometimes called,
grandfather's clock). 1t was
the first timepiece that
could tell time to a minute
or better and was the first
accurate enough to be use-
ful to scientists.

Falling Bodies

Galileo was quite satisfied
that all bodies fell at equal
rates, provided that air re-
sistance didn’t complicate
matters. If objects fell
through a vacuum, then
there would be no resis-

tance, and if this could be
observed, the question
could be settled directly in-
stead of by inference.

The English physicist
Robert Hooke (1635—1701)
designed an air pump that
worked better and more
quickly than Guericke's

(see 1645). When Hooke
had a good vacuum in a
large jar, he arranged for a
feather and a coin to be re-
leased from the top of the
jar at the same time, and
behold, they dropped at the
same speed.
