years before being de-
stroyed by an earthquake,
and after its destruction its
size was greatly exagger-
ated.

In Alexandria a much
more useful and even larger
structure was built, the
first major lighthouse. It
was called the Pharos from

270 B.C.

Water Clock

The sundial gave people an
idea of the passage of
hours, but it did so only by
day when the sun was out,
and it wasn't portable.
Other ways of measur-
ing time were also used,
since any process that re-
mained steady over a pe-
riod of time would serve
the purpose at least
crudely. There was the
hourglass, in which fine,
dry sand dripped from an
upper chamber to a lower
one in a known time. There

 

the name of the spit of land
on which it was built. Tt
was at least 280 feet high,
rested on a bulky square
base, and had stairs up
which loads of resinous
wood had to be carried. (No
elevators, of course.) The
light of the burning wood
could be seen 35 miles out

 

were candles that burned
down a given length in a
known time, which could
be marked off to indicate
the passage of hours. In
Egypt and in China, water
dripping from an upper
chamber to a lowerone had
long been used as a way of
telling time.

About 270 B.c., a Greek
inventor, Ctesibius (2d cen-
tury B.c.), devised a model
of the water clock that
gained great popularity. It
included a float in the
water, which rose as the

water in the lower chamber

to sea. It, too, was com-
pleted in 280 B.c. and it
stood for sixteen centuries
before being destroyed by
an earthquake.

Both the Colossus of
Rhodes and the Pharos
were listed by the ancients
as among the Seven Won-
ders of the World.

 

accumulated. This float
was attached to a notched
rod that turned a gear as it
pushed upward, which in
turn twisted a pointer that
marked off numbers from 1
to 12. The Greeks called the
device a clepsydra (water-
stealer), since the water qui-
etly leaked out of the upper
chamber.

Water clocks could tell
time well enough to govern
the length of time a person
might talk in court or be-
fore an assembly, but they
were nevertheless crude
timepieces at best.
