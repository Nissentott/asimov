Indian Ocean

For a brief period under the
Emperor Yung-lo of China
(who reigned from 1402 to
1424), it seemed as though
China might become a sea
power. A Muslim eunuch,
Cheng Ho (ca. 1371- ca.
1433), led a series of expedi-
tions southward and west-
ward through the Indian
Ocean. His first expedition
sailed forth in 1405, with
twenty-seven thousand
men and three hundred
ships, and forced the poten-

1418

tates of the Indonesian is-
lands to accept Chinese
overlordship (at least until
the ships left).

In a second voyage in
1409, Cheng Ho visited
India and Ceylon. When the
Ceylonese attacked the
ships, he defeated them and
brought the ruler of Ceylon
a prisoner to China. In later
voyages (there were seven
in all), he went still farther
west, reaching the Red Sea
and visiting Mecca and
Egypt.

After Emperor Yung-

lo’s death, however, suc-
ceeding emperors decided
that China had no need to
venture far afield in order
to visit and deal with the in-
ferior barbarians. China
was a world in itself and it
was enough for the Chinese.

And so, in effect, China
abdicated its chance at
world influence and left it
to other much smaller,
much weaker, and much
less advanced nations.

Little Portugal, at the oppo-
site end of the vast Eur-
asian continent, had an
attitude quite different
from that of China. China
was aware of its immense
self-sufficiency; Portugal
was aware of its own insuf-
ficiencies. China needed
nothing from abroad; Por-
tugal wanted silk, spices,
and all sorts of other
things. What's more, Portu-
gal was at the very end of
the line, farthest from the
source, so that it received

least and paid most. And
now that the Mongols were
gone and the hostile Otto-
man Turks were in control
of the Middle East (despite
the fierce temporary shock
of Tamerlane’s career),
trade between China and
western Europe had dwin-
dled further.

This was the situation
that faced Prince Henry of
Portugal (1394—1460). It oc-
curred to him that there
was no use in trying to
trade with the gorgeous
East that Marco Polo had
so fetchingly described—at

least not by land. Why not
instead bypass the Turks al-
together and sail around Af-
rica to get there?

The trouble was that
no one knew how far south
Africa extended, whether
the voyage was practical,
the seas navigable, the
Tropic Zone passable, and
so on. (No one paid any at-
tention to Herodotus's wild
tale of the Phocnicians hav-
ing circumnavigated Africa
two thousand vears before.)

Prince Henry therefore
established an observatory
and school for navigation
