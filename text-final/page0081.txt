Coffee

In many regions of the
world, it is necessary to
treat water before it is safe
to drink. Alcohol will kill
germs, so that many people
drank beer or wine rather
than water. (They didn't
know about germs, but
beer or wine tasted better
anyway.) Others boiled
water and added tea

leaves to get rid of the flat
taste.

The Muslims were not
allowed to drink wine and
didnâ€™t know about tea. Nat-
urally, they would be on
the watch for something.

Coffee may have origi-
nally grown wild in Ethio-
pia in the province of Kalffe
and been brought to south-
ern Arabia. There, in 850,
according to tradition, a

goatherd noticed that his
goats acted frisky after
eating berries of the plant.
He tried it himself, liked
the sensation, and told oth-
ers. In time, people learned
how to roast the beans ob-
tained from the berries,
steep them in boiling
water, and produce coftee.
Centuries later, coffee was
introduced to western Eu-
rope.
