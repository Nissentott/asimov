Other Centers
of the Universe

At this time it seemed obvi-
ous to almost everybody
that the Earth was solid,
immeovable, and the center
of the Universe, with every-
thing in the sky moving
about it. It certainly looked
that way, and why should
the evidence of one's eyes
be denied?

Nevertheless, the Greek
philosopher Philolaus (5th
century B.c.), a student of
Pythagoras (see 520 B.c.),
felt that the Earth, with all
the visible planets includ-
ing the Sun, rotated about
a central fire, which could
not be seen. He was the first
person we know of to sug-
gest that the Earth moved
and was not at the center of
the Universe, but his sug-
gestion was more mystical
than rational and it won lit-
tle credence.

The Greek astronomer
Heracleides Ponticus (ca.
390-after 322 B.c.) did not

go so far. He felt the Earth
was the immovable center
of the Universe, but he
pointed out, about 350 B.c.,
that Mercury and Venus
were never very far from
the Sun. This could be ac-
counted for by schemes the
Greeks worked out that had
each planet circling inde-
pendently about the Earth,
but to do so was difficult.
Heracleides maintained
that it was much simpler to
suppose that Mercury and
Venus circled the Sun, and
that the Sun, with these
two subsidiary bodies in at-
tendance, circled the Earth.
He was the first to suggest
that there was at least
some heliocentrism to the
Universe, that at least some
bodies revolved about the
Sun and only secondarily
about the Earth.

Logic
Everyone reasons after a
fashion. It is impossible not

to. Primordial hunters
would reason from foot-

prints that an animal had
passed that way and would
identify it from the nature
of the markings. Every-
thing you do, if you are in a
normal state of mind, has
some reason behind it. Un-
fortunately, however, there
are innumerable ways of
reasoning in a faulty man-
ner, and reasoning in gen-
eral can be swayed by
emotions, by self-interest,
and so on. The result is that
people frequently, and
under some circumstances
almost always, behave in
an irrational manner.

Aristotle (see 387 B.c.)
was the first thinker we
know of who undertook to
work out a legitimate sys-
tem of reasoning (logie,
from the Greek for â€œword").
His book Organon devel-
oped the study of logic in
great and satisfying detail,
describing the art of reason-
ing from premise to neces-
sary conclusion and
thereby demonstrating how
to establish the validity of a
line of thought.
