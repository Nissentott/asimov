Periodic Table
of the Elements

Newlands had tried to set
up a table of elements that
would allow them to be
grouped into natural fami-
lies (see 1863). A Russian

chemist, Dmitry Ivanovich
Mendeleyev (1834-1907),
now tried his hand at the
task.

Like Newlands, Men-
deleyev arranged the
elements in order of in-
creasing atomic weight.
However, he did not try to

 

be too simple and arrange
them in a fixed gridwork of
seven elements per row. In-
stead, letting himself be
guided by the valence of
each element, he allowed
the length of the period
(row) to increase. He had
hydrogen all by itself, then
two periods of seven ele-
ments each, then two peri-
ods of seventeen elements
each. He had prepared
what is now called the peri-
odic table of the elements.

He published his table
on March 6, 1869, beating
out others who were at-
tempting the same task, no-
tably the German chemist
Julius Lothar Meyer (1830-
1895).

In 1871 Mendeleyev
went a step further, one
which put him in a class by
himself. In order to keep
the valences and other
properties of elements simi-
lar as one looked down the
columns of his table, he
had to leave empty spaces.
He did not view this as an
imperfection in his table.
He merely announced that
the empty spaces repre-
sented elements that had
not yet been discovered.

He picked out three
gaps in particular, one
under boron, one under
