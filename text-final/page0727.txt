when it is closest to the
Sun, it is a little closer to us
than Neptune is. As luck
would have it, Pluto had
been approaching perihe-
lion ever since it was dis-
covered (see 1930), and by
this time it could be seen
from Earth about as well as
it had ever been seen.

The spectrum of the
light it reflected from the
Sun was studied, and in
1976 it was decided that
Plutoâ€™s surface was covered
with frozen methane.

Synthetic Gene

Khorana had synthesized a
gene (see 1970). Now he
went a step further and

placed a synthetic gene in-
side a living cell. There it
proved perfectly capable of
functioning. This was the
final proof (if any were
needed) that the scientific
conclusions about the struc-
ture of the gene were valid.

String Theory

Suggestions were made in
1976 to the effect that, as
the Universe cooled in the
first instants after the big
bang, flaws or creases
would have appeared in the
structure of space. These
would form long one-di-
mensional strings con-
taining huge masses,
energies, and gravitational

fields. Such thoughts per-
sist, but observational evi-
dence for the existence of
such strings has not yet
been obtained.

Rings of Uranus

On March 10, 1977, the
planet Uranus moved in
front of a ninth-magnitude
star in the constellation of

Libra. This occultation was
observed by the American
astronomer James L. Elliot
from an airplane that toock
him high enough to mini-
mize the distorting and ob-

scuring effects of the lower
atmosphere. The idea was
to observe how the star-
light dimmed as the atmo-
sphere of Uranus
approached the star and
