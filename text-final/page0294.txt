Brain

In 1810 a German physi-
cian, Franz Joseph Gall
(1758—1828), published the
first volume of a four-vol-
ume treatise on the nervous
system, In it he stated that
the gray matter on the sur-
face of the brain and in the
interior of the spinal cord
was the active and essential
part, and that the white
matter, deeper in the brain
and on the surface of the
spinal cord, was connecting

material. In this he was cor-
rect.

Gall believed that the
shape of the brain had
something to do with men-
tal capacity and that differ-
ent parts of the brain were
involved with different
parts of the human body.
There was something to
this, too, but Gall went
much too far. He believed
he could correlate the
shape of the brain with all
sorts of emotional and tem-
peramental qualities and

that the shape of the brain
could, in turn, be deduced
from the superficial uneven-
nesses of the skull. This
marks the beginning of the
pseudoscience of phrenology
(from Greek words mean-
ing “study of the mind”) in
which character is suppos-
edly analyzed by feeling the
bumps on the head.
