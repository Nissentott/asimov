strokes. As the piston
moved outward (first
stroke), a mixture of air
and inflammable vapor
would be drawn into the
cylinder. As the piston
moved inward (second
stroke), the mixture would
be compressed, and at the

height of the compression,
a spark would set off an ex-
plosion. The explosion
would drive the piston out-
ward (third stroke, which
would supply the power
that did the work). As the
piston moved inward
(fourth stroke), the waste

gases would be forced out.
The cycle would then be re-
peated.

Otto built such a four-
cycle engine in 1876. The
Otto engine, as it was
called, was such a vast im-
provement that it caught
on at once and was the
