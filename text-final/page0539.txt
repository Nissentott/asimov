in 1919 developed a mass
spectrometer, which could
separate ions so delicately
that all ions of a particular
mass would focus in a fine
line on a photographic film.
Working with neon ions,
Aston showed that there
were two lines, one indicat-
ing a mass of 20 and the
other a mass of 22. From
the comparative darkness
of the two lines, Aston cal-
culated that the ions of
mass 20 were 10 times as
numerous as those of 22, If
all the ions were lumped to-
gether, they would have an
average mass of 20.2, and
that was indeed the atomic
weight of neon. (Later, a
third group of neon ions of
mass 21, occurring in only
a tiny concentration, was
discovered.)

Working with chlorine
atoms, Aston found again
two types of atoms, with
masses of 35 and 37, in the
ratio of 2 to 1. A weighted
average came out to 35.5,
which was the atomic
weight of chlorine.

The use of the mass
spectrograph eventually
showed that most stable el-
ements (but not all) con-
sisted of two or more stable
isotopes. The atomic nuclei
of a particular element all
had the same positive elec-
tric charge, but the isotopes
differed in mass. Each had
its own mass number.

For this work, Aston
was awarded the Nobel
Prize for chemistry in 1922.

Nuclear
Reaction

Rutherford, in his work
with alpha-particle bom-
bardments of matter (see
1906), had made gases his
target. For instance, when
he bombarded hydrogen,
he got bright scintillations
on a zinc sulfide screen
(which gave off a flash of
light whenever struck by an
energetic subatomic parti-
cle). The alpha particles
themselves produced scin-
tillations, but the new scin-
tillations, which appeared
when hydrogen was pres-
ent, were particularly
bright.

Rutherford decided
(correctly) that the alpha
particles occasionally
struck a hydrogen nucleus
(consisting of a single pro-
ton) and hurled it forward.
It was these speeding pro-
tons, he felt, that produced
the bright scintillations.

In 1919, when nitrogen
was introduced into the cyl-
inder, occasional bright
scintillations like those of
protons were produced.
Rutherford knew that the
nitrogen nucleus had a
charge of +7, so that it had
to contain at least seven

protons. He felt that the
alpha particle must knock
one of these protons out of
the nitrogen nucleus every
once in a while.

The number of alpha-
particle scintillations pro-
duced under these
circumstances gradually
decreased. Rutherford rea-
soned that some of the par-
ticles must be absorbed by
the nitrogen nuclei. If a ni-
trogen nucleus absorbed an
alpha particle with its
charge of +2 and lost a pro-
ton with its charge of +1,
the net change would leave
the nitrogen nucleus with a
total charge of +8. This is
the characteristic charge of
an oxygen nucleus.

In short, what Ruther-
ford had done was to com-
bine a helium nucleus (an
alpha particle) and a nitro-
gen nucleus to form a hy-
drogen nucleus (a proton)
and an oxygen nucleus. He
had converted one type of
atom into another by sub-
atomic bombardment.

Ordinary chemical re-
actions involve the transfer
or sharing of electrons, as
Lewis had pointed out (see
1916). Now Rutherford had
produced reactions that in-
volved the transfer of parti-
cles inside the nucleus. In
other words, he had
brought about the first hu-
manly engineered nuclear
reaction.
