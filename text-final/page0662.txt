strong interaction, the
strangeness number would
have to remain unchanged,
and since all the particles
they might break down into
had 0 strangeness, they
couldn’t break down in that
way. Therefore, they were
forced to break down by

the weak interaction, in
which the strangeness num-
ber didn’t matter. Hence
the comparatively long life-
time of the strange parti-
cles.

As a result of this and
other work, Gell-Mann re-
ceived the Nobel Prize for
physics in 1969.

Masers

Einstein had pointed out
that if a photon of a certain
size struck a molecule, the
molecule would absorb the
photon and rise to a higher
energy level, If such a pho-
ton struck a molecule that
was already in the higher
energy level, the molecule
would return to the lower
energy level, emitting a
photon of exactly the same
wavelength and moving in
exactly the same direction
as the striking photon,
which would itself continue
to move on. Now there
would be two photons,
which would strike two
other high-level molecules,
so that you would end with
four. In a very brief time,
there would be a vast flood

of photons, all of the same
wavelength (monochro-
matic) and all moving in
the same direction (coher-
ent radiation).

After World War I1,
when microwaves became
extremely important in con-
nection with radar and
radio astronomy, the Amer-
ican physicist Charles Hard
Townes (b. 1915) wondered
if use could be made of this
principle to produce a mi-
crowaye beam of great in-
tensity.

The ammonia mole-
cule, for instance, vibrates
24 billion times a second
under appropriate condi-
tions. This could be con-
verted into microwaves
with a wavelength of 1Y
centimeters. Suppose am-
monia molecules were then
raised to a higher energy
level through exposure to
heat or electricity and ex-
posed to a feeble beam of
microwaves of the natural
frequency of the ammonia
molecule (1% centimeters).
That should release a much
stronger beam of the same
wavelength.

By December 1953,
Townes had a device that
actually worked in this
fashion. The process was de-
scribed by the phrase micro-
wave amplification by
stimulated emission of radia-
tion. Using the initials of
the phrase, the instrument
was referred to more briefly
as a maser.

Two Soviet physicists,
Aleksandr Mikhaylovich
Prokhorov (b. 1916) and Ni-
kolay Gennadiyevich Basov
(b. 1922) worked out the
theoretical basis of the
maser independently of
Townes at about the same
time. As a result, all three
shared in the Nobel Prize
for physics in 1964.

Heart-Lung
Machine

A heart-lung machine (or
pump oxygenator) is one
that takes venous blood
from the veins, oxygenates
it by mixing it with air, and
pumps it back into the ar-
teries, thus bypassing lungs
and heart. It makes it possi-
ble to stop the heart and
perform open-heart surgery
without endangering the
patient's life.

The first successful
heart-lung machine, de-
vised by John G. Gibbon of
the United States, was used
in 1953. Since then it has
been repeatedly improved
and is now used in the coro-
nary bypass operations that
are routinely performed to
relieve the life-threatening
agony of angina pectoris.

Transistorization

The transistor had been in-
vented by Shockley and his
group (see 1948), but its per-
