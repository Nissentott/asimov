pronunciation of
Pergamum.

Parchment is much
stronger than papyrus and
lasts practically forever. It
can be scraped clean and

used again (no always a
good thing), whereas papy-
rus cannot be. lis greatest
flaw is that it is much more
expensive than papyrus.
Then too, parchment can-
not be formed into long

sheets that can be rolled
into a volume. Instead, sep-
arate sheets have (o be
glued together into a codex,
which is the form in which
modern books appear.

 

Distance of
the Moon

In astronomy it is neces-
sary to work with angles.
You can’t measure the dis-
tance between two heav-
enly bodies by holding a
yardstick against the sky.
You can only measure the
angle you must turn your
head in looking first at one,
then at the other.

If you make the angle

part of a right triangle,
then the sides have fixed ra-
tios to one another. The ra-
tios have names like sine,
cosine, and rangent. They
are examples of trigonomet-
ric functions.

The Greek astronomer
Hipparchus (fl. 146—127
B.C.), usually considered the
greatest of ancient astrono-
mers, was the first to make
up careful tables relating
angles to side ratios, so that
if you knew the angle, you

could look up the ratios,
and vice versa. For this rea-
son, Hipparchus is usually
considered the founder of
trigonometry.

Hipparchus used trigo-
nometry to calculate the
distance from the Earth to
the Moon. First he noted the
Moon's position against
the stars from different po-
sitions on Earth, because
when your point of view
changes, a relatively near
object seems to change posi-
