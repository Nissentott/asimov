gen. He called this sub-
stance cytochrome (Greek
for “cell color”) and
showed, eventually, that
the substance was actually
a chain of enzymes that
passed hydrogen atoms
from one to another until
the final enzyme combined
them with oxygen.

Irradiation

Vitamin D is not often to be
found, as such, in food.
However, it was known
that sunshine converted an
inactive precursor in the
skin to vitamin D (see
1921). It followed that simi-
lar inactive precursors of vi-

tamin D might exist in
food, which exposure to
sunlight (irradiation) might
produce.

The American biochem-
ist Harry Steenbock (1886—
1967) showed in 1924 that
this was, in fact, the case,
and the use of irradiated
food grew common.

Packing Fraction

Six years earlier, Aston had
used his mass spectrograph
to determine the mass and
relative occurrence of the
isotopes of various stable el-
ements (see 1919). Out of
the 257 stable isotopes we
now know to exist, he ob-
tained the masses of 212.
By 1925 Aston had
brought his mass spectro-
graph to such a pitch of ac-
curacy that he was able to
show that the mass num-
bers of the individual iso-
topes were actually very
slightly different from inte-
gers, sometimes a little
above, sometimes a little

below. These slight discrep-
ancies occurred because
forming the nuclei from the
individual subatomic parti-
cles that made them up ab-
sorbed or produced energy,
and this energy was the
equivalent of tiny bits of
mass lost or gained in ac-
cordance with Einstein’s
equation relating mass and
energy (see 1905, Mass-En-
ergy). The energy change
produced by packing to-
gether subatomic particles
in a nucleus was called the
packing fraction. Since it
represented the energy
binding the particles to-
gether, it could also be
called the binding energy.

This meant that if one
type of nucleus was con-
verted into another kind of
nucleus with a tighter pack-
ing, mass would be lost and
energy produced on a far
larger scale per particle
than was produced in ordi-
nary chemical reactions in-
volving the outer electrons
of an atom.

This made sense out of
Harkins’s contention that
hydrogen-to-helium conver-
sion would produce a great
deal of energy (see 1915)
and generalized it to nu-
clear reactions as a whole.

It also explained the en-
ergy of alpha particles.
