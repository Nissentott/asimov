 

and gathered in freedom
and comparative idleness
and wondered what had
happened to evict them
from this Elysium and
force them to earn their
bread by the sweat of their
brow.

Then too, Adam'’s first
two sons were depicted as
Abel, a herder, and Cain, a
farmer. The farmers in-
creased in population faster
than the herders did, and
we can well imagine that
areas devoted to farming
spread and steadily took up
space that had earlier been
freely used by herders. (The
same thing happened in the
American West, when the
farmers settled the land
and fenced in their plots to
the discomfiture of the no-
madic cowboys.) No won-
der the Bible pictures Cain
as killing Abel.

Agriculture, for the
first time, condemned
human beings to a seden-
tary existence. Once a farm
was established, there
could be no further wander-
ing. The farmers had to re-
main with the farm, which
was fixed in one place.

A sedentary life had its
dangers. As long as human
beings hunted and gath-
ered, or even herded, dan-
ger could be avoided. If a
hungry, marauding tribe
approached, intent on tak-
ing what food they could
find, the tribe already pres-

ent, if they decided fighting
would be too dangerous,
could always flee.

Farmers could not run,
at Jeast not without aban-
doning their farms and
seeing their lifework ruined
and themselves faced with
starvation. Once the popu-
lation had increased,
thanks to agriculture, they
could not possibly find
enough food to maintain
themselves except by con-
tinuing with agriculture—
they had a tiger by the tail.

Farmers therefore had
to be prepared to fight at
whatever cost, and they
gathered together for mu-
tual self-protection. They
would find a site on an ele-
vation (so that they could
throw missiles downward,
whereas an enemy would
have to throw them up-
ward, with lesser effect)
and with a secure water
supply (you can go without
food for a period of time
but not without water).
There they would build
houses and surround them
with a protective wall. The
result would be a city, and
the inhabitants would be
city-dwellers, or citizens.

In northern Iragq, for in-
stance, near the site where
herding and agriculture de-
veloped, are the remains of
a very ancient city, founded
perhaps in 8000 B.c., at a
site called Jarmo. It is a
low mound into which, be-

ginning in 1948, the Ameri-
can archaeologist Robert J.
Braidwood dug carefully.
He found the remains of
houses built with thin walls
of packed mud and divided
into small rooms. The city
may have held no more
than a hundred to three
hundred people, but cities
grew rapidly larger.

Agriculture made it
possible for farmers to pro-
duce more food than their
own families needed. This
meant that pes; ‘¢ could do
things other than farming
—for example, engage in ar-
tisanry or art—and trade
their products for some of a
farmer’s excess food. For
the first time, human be-
ings could find time to
think of something other
than the next meal. In addi-
tion, living in close quar-
ters in a city, they could
interact easily, and the in-
novations and ideas of one
could be rapidly transmit-
ted to the others.

As a result, the coming
of agriculture and of cities
meant the coming also of a
new and more complex
way of life, which we call
civilization (from a Latin
word for “city-dweller”).
The civilized area was
small at first, but it spread
outward steadily until it
now occupies virtually the
entire world.
