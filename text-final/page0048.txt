Epilepsy

Following the rationalist
view, the Greek physician
Hippocrates (ca. 460—ca.
377 B.c.) maintained that
all diseases had natural
causes and were not to be
viewed as divine visitations
or punishments.

In particular, about
420 B.c., he applied this
rule to epilepsy, a disease

400 B.C.

Catapults

The Greeks of this period
were good at war. They had
developed hoplites (from a
Greek word for “heavy
shield”), or heavily armed
foot soldiers. The hoplites’
helmets, breastplates, and
leg armor were made of
good steel. They carried a
shield on one arm (instead
of around the neck) and a
sword in the other. They
also had long spears to

 

whose sufferers were likely
to fall to the ground sud-
denly and behave as though
they were no longer in con-
trol of their moaning,
twitching bodies. It was
called the “sacred disease,”
and epileptics were thought
to be in the grip of gods or
demons. Hippocrates, on
the other hand, sought a
physical cure or ameliora-
tion.

thrust with, rather than to
hurl. They were trained to
fight in close formation as a
unit—it was not the indi-
vidual champion but the
weight of the entire forma-
tion that counted. A line of
hoplites could wipe out the
lightly armed disorderly
mob that made up most
non-Greek infantry, and it
was for that reason that the
Greeks managed to defeat
the enormous Persian Em-
pire.

 

Hippocrates believed
that health depended on
the proper balance of the
four humors (or fluids) of
the body: blood, phlegm,
bile, and black bile. In this
he was wrong, but at least
he sought the cause of dis-
ease among natural phe-
nomena, and in that he was
not wrong.

  

The most important
Greek city in the West was
Syracuse, on the eastern
coast of Sicily, which
reached its period of great-
est power under Dionysius
(reigned 405-367 B.c.). He
encouraged work on new
weapons, and about 400
B.C. his workers devised the
catapult (from Greek words
meaning “‘to hurl down").
In its first form it was like a
giant bow that was immo-
bile and took many men to
