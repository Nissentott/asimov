By counting the varves
(Swedish for “layers”), and
counting each fine/coarse
accumulation as one year,
de Geer estimated that the
process had been going on
for twelve thousand years.
That meant it had been
twelve thousand years ago
that the glaciers of the most
recent ice age had re-
treated. (This was about
the time agriculture was

coming into use, in the Mid-
dle East—see 8000 B.C.)

By studying the thick-
ness of the varves, some
idea of changing climate
could also be obtained.

This was the first tech-
nique for counting thou-
sands of years with
considerable accuracy. A
number of other such tech-
niques were to be devel-
oped later.

Ytterbium

Six elements had been iso-
lated thus far from the rare
earths, but the list was not
complete. In 1878 the Swiss
chemist Jean-Charles-Gallis-
sard de Marignac (1817—
1894) discovered another.
He named it ytterbium from
the quarry of Ytterby
where the first rare earth
had been discovered by Ga-
