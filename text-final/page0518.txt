Isotopes

During the intense study of
radioactive phenomena
that had been going on for
the previous seventeen
years, some forty to fifty dif-
ferent elements had been re-
ported (as judged by
differences in radioactive
properties—the kinds, in-
tensities, and energies of
particles emitted). How-
ever, there were only ten to
twelve places available for
them in the periodic table.
Either the periodic table
did not apply to radioactive
elements or there was some-
thing subtle about those ele-
ments that had been
missed.

The British chemist
Frederick Soddy (1877—
1956) worked on the prob-
lem. He made clear what is
now called the radioactive
displacement law. (The Pol-
ish chemist Kasimir Fajans
[1887—1975] made these
same suggestions indepen-
dently at about the same
time.) When an atom gives
off an alpha particle, the
alpha particle has a posi-
tive charge of 2 and a mass
of 4. The atom that gave it
off therefore has to turn
into another atom with a

smaller charge (by 2) on its
nucleus and a smaller mass
(by 4).

When a beta particle is
given off, with a negative
charge of 1, the loss of the
negative charge is equiva-
lent to the gain of a positive
charge. An atom that gives
off a beta particle therefore
turns into another atom
with a larger nuclear
charge (by 1). Since an elec-
tron has only a tiny mass,
the mass of an atom is vir-
tually unchanged in beta-
particle emission.

A gamma ray, having
neither electric charge nor
mass, does not affect the na-
ture of an atom when given
off; it merely decreases the
atom’s energy content.

By following these
changes, Soddy suggested
that a given place in the pe-
riodic table might be occu-
pied by two or more
different substances, distin-
guishable from each other
by their differing radioac-
tive properties. These occu-
pants of the same place
would be equal in nuclear
charge but different in
mass. Soddy called them
isotopes, from Greek words
meaning “‘same place.”

For his advancement of

the isotope concept, Soddy
was awarded the Nobel
Prize for chemistry in 1921.

Lead Isotopes

Soddy had worked out the
isotope concept in connec-
tion with radioactive ele-
ments (see above), but

these were available in
such tiny quantities that
atomic weights could not
be determined, and the exis-
tence of isotopes could not
be checked in that way.
However, the radioactive
displacement law made it
clear that uranium and tho-
rium each broke down to a
different isotope of lead,
and that could be checked.

The American chemist
Theodore William Richards
(1868-1928) had worked
out unprecedentedly accu-
rate methods for determin-
ing atomic weights, and he
used these methods to de-
termine the atomic weight
of lead obtained from ores
containing uranium or tho-
rium and those containing
neither.

In 1913 Richards found
definite variations in the
atomic weight of lead, and
this strongly supported the
isotope concept. For his
