Neutron
Bombardment

As soon as Chadwick had
discovered the neutron (see
1932), it was clear that it
would be an extremely use-
ful tool for the bombard-
ment of nuclei. Protons and
alpha particles, being posi-
tively charged, are repelled
by the positively charged
nuclei, and much of their
energy must be expanded
in overcoming this repul-
sion. Neutrons, being un-
charged, can drift into a
nucleus even when low in
energy.

When a neutron is ab-
sorbed by the nucleus of a

particular atom, the new
nucleus may be unstable
and may emit a beta parti-
cle, which by subtracting a
negative charge converts a
neutron in the nucleus into
a proton. The net result is
that the nucleus ends up
with one proton more than
it started with, which
makes it an element that is
one higher in atomic num-
ber.

In 1934 it occurred to
Fermi (see 1926 and 1931)
that it would be particu-
larly interesting to bom-
bard uranium atoms with
neutrons and perhaps form
atoms with an atomic num-
ber of 93, which are not
known in nature.

The results of the bom-
bardment turned out to be
confusing, and the confu-
sion was not straightened
out for five yearsâ€”but then
with portentous results. For
his work on neutron bom-
bardment generally, Fermi
was awarded the Nobel
Prize for physics in 1938.

Weak
Interaction

Pauli had suggested that
every time a beta particle
was emitted by a nucleus, a
neutrino (without charge or
mass) was also emitted (see
1931).
