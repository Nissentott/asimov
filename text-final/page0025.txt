Moon. It takes 29 or 30
days for the Moon to go
through its cycle of phases,
and it takes 12 or 13 of
these cycles (months, from
the word Moon) to make up
the cycle of the seasons.

We don’t know when
people first began to attach
importance to the months.
There are indications that
even prehistoric people
counted them, but it was
the people of the Tigris-
Euphrates region who first
systematized the matter.
They worked out a cycle of
19 years, in which certain
years had 12 lunar months
and others had 13 lunar
months. Such a cycle kept
the years even with the sea-
sons. This lunar calendar
was adopted by the Greeks
and the Jews and is still
used as the Jewish liturgi-
cal calendar.

The Egyptians, how-
ever, did not make use of
the Moon primarily. To

2650 B.C.

them, the important [ea-
ture of the year was the pe-
riodic flooding of the Nile.
The priests in charge of irri-
gation carefully studied the
height of the river from day
to day and eventually dis-
covered that, on the aver-
age, the flood came every
365 days. That was also the
time it took the Sun to
make an apparent circuit of
the sky relative to the stars.
(In modern times, we view
this as the time it takes the
Earth to go around the
Sun.) This is the solar year,
and a calendar based on it
is a solar calendar.

The Egyptians were
aware that there were 12
new Moons to the year, so
they had 12 months, but
they made each month 30
days long, paying no atten-
tion to the actual phase of
the Moon. That made 360
days, to which they added 5
more days at the end.

This calendar was

much simpler and handier
than any other calendar in-
vented in ancient times.
Historians are uncertain of
the date when it was first
adopted, but priests may
have been using it for their
private computations (it ob-
viously made them more
powerful if they alone knew
when the Nile would flood)
as early as 2800 B.c.

Nothing better than
the Egyptian calendar was
devised for nearly three
thousand years, and even
then what was produced
was a mere modification of
it—and not all the changes
were for the better. Our
present calendar is still
based on the Egyptian cal-
endar, with changes that
are, in some cases, also not
for the better. This makes
our calendar, in essence,
nearly five thousand years
old.

Thanks to the Nile, the
Egyptians were able to
grow a surplus of food so
that many could devote
themselves, for at least part

of the year, to other tasks.
That meant that the Egyp-
tian rulers could put the
Egyptian people to work on
public projects designed to
show the greatness of their
rulers and, through them,
of the nation and the peo-
ple. The projects would

also serve as memorials to
that greatness to future gen-
erations.

Thus the Egyptian rul-
ers built elaborate houses
(or palaces, as we now call
them). Indeed, the ruler
was referred to as pharaoh,
which is the Greek version
