star, a bright planet that ap-
peared in the eastern sky
before sunrise, and they
called it Phosphoros (the
Greek word for “light-
bringer,” because once it
appeared, the Sun was not
far behind).

Pythagoras (see 520

480 B.C.

B.c.) was the first Greek to
realize the two were the
same object, since when the
evening star was in the sky
there was no morning star
and vice versa. (He is sup-
posed to have traveled in
Babylonia, and he may
have learned this there.)

About 500 B.c., he named
this single planet, which
swung from one side of the
Sun to the other and back
again, Aphrodite, after the
Greek goddess of love and
beauty. The Romans (and
we) called it by their equiv-
alent, Venus.

 

 

Dreams

Dreams have always
seemed to human beings to
be a doorway into some
strange and different

world. Dreams in which
people who were dead ap-
peared and seemed to live
and speak might have given
rise to notions of ghosts
and a spirit world, and rein-
forced belief in a life hereaf-

ter. Dreams that made
little sense might seem like
obscure messages from di-
vine beings. Dreams are de-
scribed as messages from
Zeus in Homer, and as mes-
sages from God in both the
Old and New Testaments.
The Greek philoso-
phers, however, were wed-
ded to rationalism. They
felt that the Universe ran
according to laws of nature

that could be understood

. by observation and reason-

ing and did not require any
supernatural force—that is,
any force outside of or supe-
rior to the laws of nature.

Thus, about 480 B.c.,
the Greek philosopher Her-
acleitus (ca. 540—ca. 480
B.C.) maintained that
dreams had no meaning
outside a person’s own
thoughts.
