measurements in conduct-
ing their experiments and
searched always for more
and more accurate ways of
measuring time.

Eventually the search
for natural cyclic move-
ments that were both pre-
cise and constant worked
down to the molecular
level. An ammonia mole-
cule, for instance, vibrated
back and forth, taking up
its two possible tetrahedral
positions alternately, about
24,000,000,000 times per
second. At constant temper-
ature, this vibration re-
mained very constant.

In 1949 the American
physicist Harold Lyons (b.
1913) was the first to har-
ness this molecular vibra-
tion to time-keeping
purposes. It was the first
atomic clock. As atomic
clocks of ever-greater preci-
sion were devised, physi-
cists could eventually time
events to a millionth of a
trillionth of a second.

Berkelium and
Californium

For five years after being
synthesized by Seaborg and
his group (see 1944), cu-
rium (atomic number 96)
had remained the most
complex atom known.

In 1949 the more com-
plex elements 97 and 98
were produced. Since this

was done at the University
of California in Berkeley,
California, element 97 was
named berkelium and 98
was named californium.

Soviet Fission
Bomb

For four years the United
States had had a monopoly
on the nuclear fission, or
atomic, bomb. There was a
comfortable feeling among
many Americans that the
Soviets weren't smart
enough to arrive at the nec-
essary technology by them-
selves.

The Soviets had been
working on fission bombs
for years, however, and
were clever enough to gain
knowledge of some of the
American techniques. On
September 22, 1949, the So-
viets exploded their first
fission bomb, and Ameri-
cans were jarred out of
their complacency. In place
of a world dominated by a
benevolent America with a
monopoly on a benevolent
atomic bomb, there were
now two superpowers that
soon became fully capable
of wiping each other out,
along with the rest of the
world.

The nations of the
world descended into a nu-
clear nightmare, from
which they have not yet
awakened.

Sickle-Cell
Anemia

Sickle-cell anemia is a dis-
ease that produces dis-
torted red cells, which are
unable to transport oxygen
properly. It particularly af-
flicts blacks, and these af-
flicted tend to die in
childhood. It was first
noted in 1910 by an Ameri-
can physician, James Bryan
Herrick (1861-1954).

It seemed clearly to be
a genetic disease, and in
1949 Linus Pauling (see
1931) was able to show that
a defective gene produced
the abnormal hemoglobin.
If this gene was present on
only one of a chromosome
pair, the carriers possessed
sickle-cell trait. These carri-
ers could lead reasonably
normal lives and also be rel-
atively resistant to malaria,
since their blood was appar-
ently less palatable to the
malarial parasite.

With a defective gene
on each of a chromosome
pair, however, the carriers
had sickle-cell anemia it-
self. The beneficial effect of
a single dose kept the defec-
tive gene going, while the
deleterious effect of a dou-
ble dose tended to wipe it
out. The total effect was to
keep an equilibrium quan-
tity in existence in some re-
gions where malaria was
particularly prevalent.
