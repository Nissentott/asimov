1066

 

Comet

Comets made periodic ap-
pearances in the sky. They
were frightening because
they came unheralded and
followed an unpredictable
path. Furthermore, their
shapes were irregular,
rather like a woman's head
with long streaming hair as
though in mourning.

(Comet is from the Greek
word for “hair.”)

The unheralded com-
ing made them appear like
special warnings from
heaven, and the streaming
“hair” made it seem cer-
tain that the warning was
of disaster. Sure enough, di-
saster always came when a
comet blazed in the sky. (Di-
saster always came when

no comet blazed in the sky,
too, but people paid no
heed to that.)

In 1066, there was a
bright comet in the sky that
attracted much attention,
especially because of events
that were than taking place
in Normandy and in En-
gland.
