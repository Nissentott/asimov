worked out a thoroughgo-
ing system of classifying
and identifying them.

In handling smooth
surfaces, people always left
sweaty, greasy fingerprints,
even when these were unno-

ticeable unless the surface
was appropriately pow-
dered. Eventually, finger-
prints proved a useful way
of showing that a given per-
son had been present at a
given place and had han-

dled a given object. This
added a new dimension to
forensic medicine (from a
Latin word referring to a
public place such as a court-
room).

Aluminum

Aluminum is the most com-
mon element in the Earth's
crust. It was first isolated
by @rsted (see 1825), but
the isolation was so diffi-
cult that it was virtually a
precious metal. Napoléon
I11 had his cutlery and a
baby rattle for the Prince
Imperial made out of alumi-
num, and the capstone on
the Washington Monument
is a slab of aluminum.

In 1886 an American
student of chemistry,
Charles Martin Hall (1863—
1914), heard his teacher say
that anyone who discov-
ered a cheap way of making
aluminum would grow rich
and famous. In his home
laboratory, using home-
made batteries, Hall de-
vised a method of

preparing aluminum by the
use of an electric current,
as Davy had prepared so-
dium and potassium nearly
eighty years before (see
1807). He used aluminum
oxide dissolved in a molten
mineral named cryolite,
and into it he stuck carbon
electrodes.

0Oddly enough, that
same year a French metal-
lurgist, Paul-Louis-Tous-
saint Héroult (1863-1914),
with the same last initial
and the same birth and
death years, independently
devised precisely the same
system, which is therefore
called the Hall-Héroult pro-
cess.

Aluminum became
cheaper almost at once,
and it is now second only to
steel as a structural mate-
rial. A combination of

lightness and strength
makes it ideal for aircraft,
for instance.

Germanium

A German chemist, Clem-
ens Alexander Winkler
(1838-1904), analyzed a sil-
ver ore and, when he had
completed his work, found
that the elements he had lo-
cated added up to only 93
percent of the whole. Puz-
zled, he searched out the re-
maining 7 percent and, in
1886, found a hitherto un-
recognized element, which
he named germanium, after
Germany.

It turned out to be eka-
silicon and filled the one re-
maining gap for which Men-
deleyev had predicted a
new element (see 1869).
