Polonium and
Radium

Marie and Pierre Curie con-
tinued to work on the radia-
tions produced by uranium
(see 1897).

In 1898 Marie Curie
showed that thorium, an-
other heavy metal, also pro-
duced radiations, and she
coined the term radioactiv-
ity for the phenomenon, so
that it could be said that
both uranium and thorium
were radioactive.

She also discovered
that although pure ura-
nium compounds were al-
ways radioactive only to
the extent that uranium
was present, some uranium
ores produced far more ra-
dioactivity than could be
accounted for by the ura-
nium present. It seemed to
her that the ores must con-
tain other elements (in
small quantities or they
would have been discov-
ered earlier) that were
much more intensely radio-
active than uranium,

In July 1898 the Curies
detected such an element,
which they called polonium
after Marie Curie's native
land. In December 1898
they detected another,
which they called radium

because of its intense radio-
activity.

For their work on radio-
activity, the Curies shared
the Nobel Prize for physics
with Becquerel (see 1896)
in 1903. For the detection
of polonium and radium,
Marie Curie (her husband
by then being dead) re-
ceived the Nobel Prize for
chemistry in 1911.

Neon, Krypton,
and Xenon

Polonium and radium were
not the only elements dis-
covered in 1898. In the pre-
vious four years, Ramsay
had discovered argon (see
1894) and helium (see
1895). There had to be sev-
eral more elements in the
zero-valence family, and he
searched for them with the
assistance of a British
chemist, Morris William
Travers (1872—1961).

A British inventor, Wil-
liam Hampson (1854—
1926), had developed a
method for producing lig-
uid air in sizable quanti-
ties. He gave some to
Ramsay and Travers, who
carefully distilled it and, in
the argon fraction, discov-
ered neon (from the Greek
word for “new”), krypton

(hidden), and xenon
(stranger). The new ele-
ments were all gases and
all zero-valence. The five el-
ements (including helium
and argon) were called, as a
group, the inert gases, or
more recently, the noble
gases.

Liquid
Hydrogen

Although nitrogen and
other gases had been lique-
fied twenty years before, hy-
drogen still remained
recalcitrant. In 1895, how-
ever, the German chemist
Carl Paul Gottfried von
Linde (1842-1934) had de-
veloped a technique of cool-
ing gases in stages, by
expansion, each cooled frac-
tion being returned to cool
another sample, which
could be cooled still further
by expansion, and so on. In
this way, Linde could pro-
duce commercial quantities
of liquid air.

Dewar (see 1889)
adopted Linde’s system, im-
proved it, and used it on hy-
drogen. The result was that
in 1898 he liquefied hydro-
gen at a temperature of
only 20° K.

Even so, that did not
represent the final victory
