that hydrogen-2, discovered
by Urey (see 1931, Deute-
rium), should be particu-
larty useful.

The German biochem-
ist Rudolf Schoenheimer
(1898-1941) obtained a
quantity of hydrogen-2
from Urey and used it to
form fat molecules that con-
tained a considerably
higher percentage of hydro-
gen-2 than would be found
in natural fat.

Samples of this isotope-
enriched fat were fed to
rats. It was assumed that
the tissues would not differ-
entiate between the two hy-
drogen isotopes but would
treat hydrogen-2 exactly
like hydrogen-1. After a
time, a rat could be killed
and its body fat analyzed
for hydrogen-2, which
would have acted as an iso-
topic tracer, indicating the
types of reactions that fat
molecules underwent. By
1935 he had achieved sur-
prising results.

For instance, until then
it had been believed that
the fat stores of an organ-
ism were usually immobile,
remaining where they were
until such time as famine
demanded their use. Under
ordinary conditions, it was
thought, the body would
make use of fat obtained
from the immediate diet.

However, Schoen-
heimer found that when iso-

tope-enriched fat was fed to
rats, half of what had been
fed was to be found in the
fat stores. In other words,
ingested fat was stored, and
stored fat was used. There
was a rapid turnover, and
body constituents were not
static but changed con-
stantly and dynamically.

Schoenheimer later
made use of nitrogen-15 to
label amino acid molecules
and show that there was
constant action there, too—
molecules rapidly changing
and shifting even though
the overall movement
might be small.

Crystalline
Viruses

The first enzyme had been
crystallized by Sumner (see
1926), and other enzymes
had been crystallized since
by Northrop and others
(see 1930), so that the mys-
tery of the chemical nature
of enzymes was removed.
The American biochem-
ist Wendell Meredith Stan-
ley (1904—1971) thought
similar techniques might
clarify some of the myster-
ies of virus structure. He
prepared a quantity of to-
bacco mosaic virus (the
first virus to be recognized
as such by Beijerinck—see
1898) by growing tobacco
and infecting it. He then
mashed up the infected

leaves and put the mash
through the usual proce-
dures used by chemists to
extract proteins and crys-
tallize them, since he felt
that viruses were probably
protein in nature.

In 1935 he obtained
fine needlelike crystals,
which he isolated and
found to possess all the in-
fective properties of the
virus in high concentration.

This raised problems,
since it had always been
thought that crystals were
a form of matter character-
istic of nonliving atoms and
molecules, and since vi-
ruses could multiply, they
had been thought to be liv-
ing. The answer, quickly ar-
rived at, was that
crystallization was not a di-
viding line between life and
nonlife, and that viruses
were so simple a life form
that they could crystallize.

As a result of this work,
Stanley was awarded a
share of the Nobel Prize for
chemistry in 1946, along
with Sumner and Nor-
throp.

Strong
Interaction

Heisenberg had tried to ex-
plain why the nucleus re-
mained intact despite the
repulsion between protons
by supposing the existence
of exchange forces (see
