Mexico

After a quarter-century of
sailing about the Carib-
bean, Spanish explorers
had still not encountered
the civilizations that ex-
isted in the American conti-
nents. In 1517, Francisco
Fernandez de Cérdoba
(14752-1525 or 1526), had
sailed westward from Cuba
and discovered the penin-
sula of Yucatan. There he
was the first to encounter
traces of the Mayan civiliza-
tion, but that was a civiliza-
tion in ruins.

Westward, however,
across the Gulf of Mexico,
lay the still flourishing

1523

Aztec Empire, which con-
trolled all of central and
southern Mexico and had a
population of about 5 mil-
lion.

In 1519 some six hun-
dred Spaniards under Her-
nan Cortés (1485—1547)
landed with seventeen
horses and ten cannon.
That this small force suf-
ficed to destroy the Aztec
Empire is not as surprising
as it may sound and does
not imply that Europeans
were innately superior to
the Aztecs. For one thing,
the Aztecs had nothing to
counter either the horses or
the cannon. For another,
the subject peoples of the

Aztecs were restive and
ready to fight on the side of
Cortés. Finally, the Aztecs
and their king, Montezuma
II (1466—1520), had the su-
perstitious feeling that the
Spaniards were gods whose
coming had been predicted,
and they did not resist
strongly until it was too
late.

So the Aztec Empire
was destroyed and Mexico
was taken over by Spain.
No effort was made to save
the Aztec culture or retain
information concerning it.
It was, after all, non-Chris-
tian.

 

Circumnavi-
gation of the
Earth

Ferdinand Magellan (ca.
1480-1521) is the English
name of a Portuguese navi-
gator, financed by Spain,
who sailed west with five
ships on September 20,
1519, in search of the Far
East. When he reached the
eastern bulge of South

America, he began looking
for a southern end to that
continent, which he found
on October 21. For over five
weeks, he felt his way
through what is now
known as the Strait of Ma-
gellan, amid storms, and on
November 28, it opened
into an ocean and the
storms ceased. As Magellan
sailed on and on through
good weather, he called
this new ocean the Pacific.

However, the Pacific
Ocean was far larger than
anyone would have ex-
pected, and was sadly free
of land. For ninety-nine
days, the ships sailed
through unbroken sea, and
the men underwent tor-
tures of hunger and thirst.
Finally they reached the is-
land of Guam, then they
sailed westward to the Phil-
ippine Islands. There, on
April 17, 1521, Magellan
