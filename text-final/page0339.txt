not so much a scientist,
however, as a promoter,
who could raise the neces-
sary money to set up a suf-
ficiently long wire, with
relays to keep the signal
from fading with distance.
One such promoter, who
had been working on the

1839

task since 1832, was the
American artist Samuel
Finley Breese Morse (1791—
1872).

In 1838 he produced a
logical list of short and
long electric impulses (dots
and dashes) for the various
letters of the alphabet. This

is called the Morse code to
this day. It was the simple
combination in Morse code

tional distress call.

 

 

Photography

The French artist Louis-
Jacques-Mandé Daguerre
(1789-1851) had been work-
ing for years on a scheme
for causing light to fall on a
suspension of silver salts in
such a way as to darken it
selectively and produce a
duplication of some scene.
This is called photography,
from Greek words meaning
“light-writing."”

The difficulty lay, first,
in performing the feat after
a reasonably short expo-
sure and, second, in keep-
ing the silver salts from

continuing to darken
and erasing the photo-
graph.

By 1839 Daguerre had
learned to dissolve the un-
changed silver salts with a
solution of sodium thiosul-
fate, so that what was left
was permanent. [t still re-
quired an exposure of at
least twenty minutes, how-
ever, and the photographs
that were obtained were
faint.

Nevertheless, photogra-
phy was born, and as others
turned to it enthusiasti-
cally, the technique was
very rapidly improved

Photography of
the Moon

With exposure times contin-
uing to decrease rapidly,
photography could be bent
to scientific purposes. The
British-born American
chemist John William
Draper (1811-1882) in-
creased the delicacy of the
photographic process to the
point where, in 1839, he
was able to take a photo-
graph of the Moon. This
was the first astronomical
photography. He was also
the first to photograph the
