Robots

The word robot (from a
Czech word for “serf” or
“slave’) had been invented
by the Czech playwright
Karel Capek (1890-1938) in
his play R.U.R., first staged
in Europe in 1920. Since Ca-
pek’s time, the word has
come to be applied to any
manufactured device, usu-
ally envisaged as humanoid
in shape (though it doesn't
have to be) and made of
metal (though again, it
doesn’t have to be), which
is capable of doing work or-
dinarily done by human be-
ings.

Although robots were
much used in science fic-
tion, the first patent wasn't
taken out on a robotic de-
vice in real life until 1954.
1t was the work of the Amer-
ican inventor George C.
Devol, Jr., who teamed up
afterward with the Ameri-
can entrepreneur Joseph F.
Engelberger (b. 1925), who
had grown interested in ro-
bots as a result of reading /,
Robot by Isaac Asimov (b.
1920).

For twenty years they
continued to develop pa-
tents, but the manufacture
of robots that were suffi-
ciently cheap and compact

to be used in industry had
to await further advances
in computers.

Bevatron

Since the first particle ac-
celerator was built by Cock-
croft and Walton (see 1929),
the energy produced by par-
ticle accelerators had in-
creased enormously. By
1954, a particle accelerator
capable of accelerating pro-
tons to an energy of 5 to 6
billion electron volts (BeV)
had been built at the Uni-
versity of California. It was
called the Bevatron because
of the energy range of the
particles it produced, and
indeed it could produce par-
ticles in the energy range of
fairly intense cosmic rays.

This meant it was no
longer necessary to wait for
cosmic rays to strike atoms
in the atmosphere and pro-
duce interesting results, as
Anderson had had to (see
1932). The necessary bom-
barding particles were al-
ways there, and in any
reasonable quantities. The
search could proceed much
more surely in the labora-
tory, especially since parti-
cle accelerators continued
to be made ever more pow-
erful as time went on.

Oral
Contraceptives

In a world that was over-
populated and growing
more so, it seemed useful to
find methods of reducing
the birthrate. The most
straightforward way of
doing so was abstention
from sex, but that wasn't re-
ally a practical solution.
The trick would be to find

a cheap and convenient
way to lower the birthrate
without interfering with
sex.

It had been noted that
there were natural ways of
bringing this about, for dur-
ing pregnancy and some
parts of the menstrual
cycle, women can safely in-
dulge in sex without much
chance, if any, of concep-
tion. It might be possible,
then, to find some sort of
hormone that, taken by
mouth in pill form, as an
oral contraceptive, would in-
duce temporary sterility.
The American biologist
Gregory Goodwin Pincus
(1903-1967) found such a
hormone, and clinical tests
in 1954 demonstrated its ef-
ficacy. Use of the Pill (as it
was popularly termed)
made possible sex without
fear of pregnancy. This
went a long way toward
abolishing the double stan-
dard and encouraged the
women's liberation move-
