strument in 1932. It was a
crude affair, to be sure, but
it was capable of magni-
fying four hundred times. It
was rapidly improved and
became an essential item in
the microscopists’ armory.

For his work, Ruska
was belatedly awarded a
share in the Nobel Prize for
physics in 1986.

Prontosil

It had been a quarter-cen-
tury since Ehrlich had
found chemicals that at-
tacked pathogenic microor-
ganisms without damaging
higher animals (see 1907),
and since then the matter
had languished.

It was clear that possi-
ble chemicals for the pur-
pose lay among the dyes.
Some dyes combined with
cells and not with others,
so surely there should be
some dyes that combined
with germs, killing them in
the process, without affect-
ing human cells.

The German biochem-
ist Gerhard Domagk (1895—
1964) conducted systematic
tests of new dyes synthe-
sized since the time of Ehr-
lich to see if he could find
something appropriate.
One of them was a newly
synthesized orange-red
compound with the trade
name Prontosil. In 1932 Do-
magk found that injections

of the dye had a powerful
curative effect on strepto-
coccus infection in mice.

As it happened, Do-
magk’s young daughter,
Hildegard, had been in-
fected by streptococci fol-
lowing the prick of a
needle. When other treat-
ment failed, Domagk in-
jected large quantities of
Prontosil. She recovered,
and the world had another
item in its chemotherapeu-
tic armory. Prontosil was
the forerunner of a large
number of drugs that
would cause many infec-
tious diseases to lose their
terrors.

For this discovery, Do-
magk was awarded the
Nobel Prize for medicine
and physiology in 1939.
(Hitler refused to allow Ger-
mans to accept Nobel
Prizes, however, because a
Peace Prize had been
awarded to Carl von Ossi-
etzky [1889-1938], an im-
prisoned German pacifist.
Domagk was therefore not
able to aceept his prize for-
mally till 1947.)

Ascorbic Acid

In 1932 the American bio-
chemist Charles Glen King
(1896—1988) concluded his
investigations of vitamin C,
in the course of which he
had isolated the vitamin
and determined its struc-
ture. The substance had a

six-carbon molecule closely
resembling those of the sug-
ars and was named
ascorbic acid, from Greek
words meaning ‘'no
scurvy.” The work of Lind
(see 1747) was thus success-
fully concluded.

Two weeks later, Szent-
Gyorgyi reported that his
hexuronic acid (see 1928)
was vitamin C, and he was
right. This set off a violent
and bitter controversy over
precedence, which contin-
ued throughout the long
lives of both men (each
lived into his 90s).

Urea Cycle

As biochemists learned
more and more about me-
tabolism, it became clear
that certain reactions fit
into the pattern of a chain.
Often the chain moved
from its starting point back
to that same point after a
number of steps (forming a
cycle), achieving some re-
sult with each turn of that
cycle.

Thus the German-born
British biochemist Hans
Adolf Krebs (1900-1981)
showed that when the
amino acid arginine broke
down and was reconstitu-
ted, it produced in the pro-
cess a molecule of urea (so
that it was called the urea
cycle). Urea is the chief ni-
trogen-containing waste in
mammals generally.
