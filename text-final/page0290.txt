opium, which Dioscorides
(see 50 B.c.) described.
(Opium is one item that
traveled from the West to
the Fast East, and not vice
versa.) An alcoholic extract
of immature opium blooms
was called laudanum and
had first been introduced
by Paracelsus (see 1556,
Mineralogy).

In 1805 the German

1806

chemist Friedrich Wilhelm
Adam Ferdinand Serturner
(1783—1841) isolated a
chemical from laudanum
that he found to be the ac-
tive ingredient. It was
much more efficacious in
dulling pain and inducing
sleep than the juice itself. It
was eventually called mor-
phine, from the Greek word
for “sleep.”

Morphine has been an
important adjunct to medi-
cal practice ever since,
though its addictive effect
was not at first understood.
Its discovery initiated the
study of alkaloids, which
are important nitrogen-
containing plant products
with marked physiological
effects even in small doses.

 

Asparagine

Vauquelin (see 1797), who
had earlier discovered me-
tallic elements such as chro-
mium and beryllium,

isolated a substance from
asparagus, which he called
asparagine. In itself, it
might not have seemed im-
portant, but as was eventu-
ally realized, it was the first

to be isolated of a set of
compounds extremely im-
portant to life, called amino
acids.
