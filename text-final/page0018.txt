been found by Stene Age
people. For one thing, these
occasional odd pebbles
were shiny and were heav-
ier than ordinary pebbles of
that size. What's more, if
these shiny pebbles were
struck with a stone ham-
mer, they did not split or
shatter as ordinary pebbles
did, but they distorted.
These occasional peb-
bles were metals. Dozens of
different metals are known,
but most of them remain in
combination with nonme-
tallic substances, and rocky
substances are the result.
Only those metals that are
inert and tend not to com-
bine with other substances
are likely to be found in a
free state. The three inert
metals most likely to be
found free are rather rare
even for metals. These are
copper, silver, and gold.
Their rareness is shown by
the fact that the very word
metal is from a Greek term
meaning ‘‘to search for.”
Metal nuggets exist
that were dealt with by
human beings as long ago
as 5000 B.c. or even earlier.
Because of their metallic
luster and the fact that they
can be beaten into interest-
ing shapes, they were used
at first almost exclusively
as ornaments. Of these,
gold was the most desired,
for it was the most beauti-
ful in color (a gleaming yel-

low), the heaviest, and the
most inert. It simply
doesn’t change with time.
Silver, a very light yellow,
tends to darken with time,
and copper, which is red-
dish, may even turn green.
(Copper is from the word
for Cyprus, the island that
served as an early source of
the metal.)

It was only when
human beings discovered
that metals could be ob-
tained from special rocks
called ores that metals be-
came common enough to
use for other purposes. Of
these, the first to be discov-
ered was copper. Copper is
combined with oxygen, car-
bon, or both in certain
rocky ores, and the discov-
ery that copper could be ob-
tained from them in pure
form took place about
4000 B.C.

Undoubtedly it was ac-
cidental at first. A fierce
wood fire might be built on
such copper ore. Under the
heat of the fire, the carbon
in the wood and in the ore
would combine with the ox-
ygen in the ore to form the
gas carbon dioxide, which
would escape, leaving me-
tallic copper behind. Some
observant person might no-
tice the reddish globules
among the ashes of the fire,
and eventually the circum-
stances would be under-
stood and the ores searched

for and deliberately heated.
In this way fire made
possible metallurgy—the
obtaining of metals from
their ores.

Copper ornaments be-
came more common there-
after, but copper could not
be used as a tool, though
one might think it could.
After all, a sharp-edged
piece of rock, if chipped,
loses its edge, and this can-
not be restored without la-
borious chipping. If a
sharp-edged piece of metal
is blunted, it can simply
and easily be beaten sharp
again. However, copper
was too easily blunted. It
couldn'’t very well be
beaten after every minor
use.

Sundials

From very early times, peo-
ple could count the days as
a measure of time, but they
often desired to measure
parts of days as well. One
way of doing so was to note
the progress of the Sun
from east to west. The mo-
tion seems to take place at
a steady speed.

Of course, one can't
stare at the Sun, but it is
the easiest thing in the
world to thrust a stick into
the ground and watch the
shadow. At sunrise, the
shadow extends far to the
west. Then, as the day pro-
