verse, what was? There was
no other candidate, and the
question had to remain in
abeyance for a time.

Respiration
and
Combustion

Lavoisier, having worked
out his theory of combus-
tion as the combination of
fuels with oxygen from the
air (see 1772), thought of
respiration. Animals ate
food that contained carbon.
They breathed air that con-
tained oxygen and exhaled
air that contained less oxy-
gen and more carbon diox-
ide.

In collaboration with a
French scientist, Pierre-
Simon de Laplace (1749—
1827), Lavoisier undertook
a series of experiments de-
signed to measure the
amount of heat and carbon
dioxide produced by a
guinea pig. It turned out
that the amount of heat
was about what would be
expected from the produc-
tion of that much carbon
dioxide, and Lavoisier
concluded that respiration
was a form of combustion.

The essential point was
that the laws that governed
combustion outside the
body seemed to hold inside
the body as well. This was
another blow against vi-

talism, the system of
thought that gave life spe-
cial status.

Balloon

Light objects can be borne
on the air, as all of us ob-
serve in the case of small
feathers, dandelion seeds,
and so on. If objects are
light enough, they needn’t
depend on wind and up-
drafts to remain in the air
(or on muscular power as
in the case of birds, bats,
and insects). A light enough
object can actually float in
air, just as wood floats on
water.

There are no known
solids or liquids that are
lighter than air, but some
gases are. It occurred to
two French brothers,
Joseph-Michel Montgolfier
(1740-1810) and Jacques-
Etienne Montgolfier (1745—
1799), that hot air ex-
panded and was therefore
lighter than an equal vol-
ume of cold air. If a quan-
tity of hot air filled a light
balloon, the hot air would
float in the air and might
have enough upward push
to carry the balloon with it.
In fact, if the balloon was
large enough, there might
be sufficient buoyancy to
carry a human being up-
ward.

On June 5, 1783, in the
marketplace of their home-
town, the brothers filled a

large linen bag, 35 feet in di-
ameter, with hot air. It
lifted 1,500 feet upward
and floated a distance of a
mile and a half in 10 min-
utes. They went to Paris,
and on September 19, they
managed a flight of 6 miles
before a crowd of three hun-
dred thousand that in-
cluded Benjamin Franklin.
The balloon carried up
not only itself but a wicker
basket in which were a
rooster, a duck, and a
sheep, which were not
harmed. Finally, on Novem-
ber 20, a hot-air balloon
carried into the air a
French physicist, Jean Fran-
cois Pilatre de Rozier
(1756—1783), and a compan-
ion. They were the first
aeronauts in history.
Meanwhile, a French
physicist, Jacques-Alex-
andre-César Charles (1746—
1823), having heard of the
hot-air balloons, realized
that hot air had compara-
tively little buoyancy and
lost that little as it cooled,
though a fire in the basket
underneath might suffice to
keep it warm for a while.
The gas hydrogen, studied
by Cavendish (see 1766),
was much lighter than hot
air and had much greater
buoyancy. What's more, the
buoyancy was permanent.
On August 27, 1783,
Charles constructed the
first hydrogen balloon and
subsequently used one to
