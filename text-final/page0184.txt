1675

 

 

Speed of light

At this time, nobody knew
how quickly light traveled.
Galileo (see 1581) had tried
to measure it by standing
on top of one hill and hav-
ing a friend stand on top of
another, each with dark lan-
terns. Galileo would reveal
the flame in his lantern and
at once his friend would re-
veal the flame in his. The
time it took between Gali-
leo’s sending the light and
seeing the return light
would be the time it took
light to make the round
trip. However, the time was
always the same, no matter
how far apart the hills
were, and Galileo realized
that he was just measuring

his friend’s reaction time
and gave up. Light obvi-
ously moved too swiftly for
its speed to be measured in
that way. (There were those
who thought it moved with
infinite speed.)

In 1675, however, a
Danish astronomer, Olaus
Roemer (1644—1710), was
carefully observing the mo-
tions of Jupiter’s satellites
from the Paris Observatory,
including the time when
they passed behind Jupiter
and were eclipsed. Cassini
(see 1665) had timed those
motions carefully and Roe-
mer was checking them. To
Roemer’s surprise, he
found that the eclipses
came progressively earlier
at those times of the year

when Earth was ap-
proaching Jupiter in its
orbit and progressively
later when Earth was reced-
ing from Jupiter.

Roemer supposed this
might be because light did
not travel at infinite speeds
but took longer to go from
Jupiter to Earth when
Earth was on the opposite
side of the Sun from Jupi-
ter, and less time when
Earth was on the same
side. From these time differ-
ences, Roemer calculated
that light must travel at a
speed of about 141,000
miles per second. This is
only about three-fourths of
its actual speed, but for a
first determination it's not
bad.
