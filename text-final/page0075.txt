Domes

A dome is a semispherical
structure on top of a build-
ing, which looks impressive
in itsell and gives an oppor-
tunity for vertical windows
that will introduce light in-
side. (Skylights on a flat
roof are less impressive and
are a source of weakness.)
The Romans first intro-
duced domes, placing one
on the Pantheon, a building
begun in 27 B.c. This was
the largest dome built be-
fore modern times. It is
heavy, however, and is
built on a circular building,

 

with no openings except

one at lhn‘ Very 1op, so its es-

thetic appeal is limited

About 480 architects in
the East Roman Empire
perfected a system of plac-
ing a hemispherical dome
upon a square support in
such a way that the bottom
of the dome could be
pierced by many windows
without sacrificing its
strength.

This discovery was
given its chance when the
East Roman Emperor Jus-
tinian (who reigned frem
527 to 565) decided to re-
build the church of Hagia

 

Sophia after its destruction
