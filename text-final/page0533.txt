Expanding
Universe

It had always been as-
sumed by the Greeks that
the Universe was change-
less, and even the astrono-
mers of the modern period,
while aware that stars var-
ied and moved and came
into being and dimmed to
death, felt that such
changes canceled each
other out and left the Uni-
verse as a whole un-
changed.

Einstein, in formulat-
ing his general relativity
equations, understood that

if he was to have a static
Universe, something would
have to be added to the
equations. He therefore
added an arbitrary con-
stant designed to make the
equations come out right,
so to speak. He later said
this was the greatest scien-
tific mistake of his life.

A Dutch astronomer,
Willem de Sitter (1872—
1934), however, was con-
tent to travel wherever Ein-
stein’s equations took him
He pointed out, in 1917,
that if the equations were

  

 

solved as they stood, the im-

plication was that the Uni-
verse was expanding. Such

a picture of an expanding
universe seemed grotesque,
for at the time, nothing
about the Universe seemed
to give a hint of this expan-
sion, but de Sitter’s sugges-
tion took on a great deal of
importance in the next de-

The Bra
crystal structure could be
worked out by X-ray dif

fraction (see 1914). Intact

and reasonably large crys-

tals are hard to come by
