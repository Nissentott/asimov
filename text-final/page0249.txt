Torsion Balance

From time immemorial,
people had used two pans
at equal distances from a
fulerum to weigh things
(see 5000 B.c.). The object
to be weighed was placed
in one pan and weights

were added to the other till
the pans were in balance.
In fact, the instrument was
called a balance.

In 1777, however, the
French physicist Charles-
Augustin de Coulomb
(1736—1806) showed that it
took a certain amount of

force to twist (that is, to
apply torsion to) a fiber or a
wire, and that the amount of
torsion was proportional to
the amount of force. Since
weight is a force, such a tor-
sion balance could be used

Molybdenum

Scheele, using methods that
had worked in isolating
manganese (see 1774), man-
aged to isolate another
metal, molybdenum. With
his usual incredible run of
bad luck, Scheele often loses
the credit for the discovery,
whichis given to another
friend of his, the Swedish
mineralogist Peter Jacob
Hjelm (1746—-1813).

Hawaiian
Islands

Captain Cook, in his final
voyage, explored the Pacific
coast of North America
north of California. This
formed the basis for the
later British claim to the re-
gion. In January 1778 he dis-
covered the Hawaiian
Islands, which he named
the Sandwich Islands after

John Montagu, fourth earl
of Sandwich (1718—1792).
The earl of Sandwich
was such an inveterate gam-
bler that he had meat
placed between two slices of
bread so that he could eat
with one hand and not be
forced to leave the
table. It was in this way that
the sandwich was invented.
He was also one of the gr
