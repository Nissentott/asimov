Edison took a series of
closely spaced photographs
along a strip of film. When
the developed film was
moved in front of a light,
the illusion of movement
was created—and the mo-
tion picture was born. A
year before Edison in-
vented the phonograph, Al-
exander Graham Bell was
searching for a way to
transmit not just telegraph
signals but the spoken

1851

word. He found it in a
mechanism that turned
sound waves into fluctuat-
ing electric current that
was reconverted into sound
at the other end. Edison
helped refine the telephone
by increasing the amount
of sound the microphone in
the mouthpiece could
carry. After earlier and less
efficient engines by Jean
Lenoir and Nikolaus Au-
gust Otto, Carl Friedrich
Benz built the first working

automobile with a gasoline-
burning internal-combus-
tion engine in 1885. In 1853
George Cayley founded the
science of aerodynamics
when, in building a glider,
he created a successful de-
sign by which a heavier-
than-air object could be
kept aloft. Although no en-
gine of that time could pro-
pel such a vehicle, the
shape he designed is the
one that finally gave wings
to human beings.

 

Rotation of
the Earth

Ever since the time of Co-
pernicus (see 1543) it had
been taken for granted that
the Earth was rotating on
its axis. Nevertheless, no
one had actually denton-
strated the fact. It seemed
stationary, and no effect
had been observed (other
than the apparent rotation
of the sky) that could be
attributed to the

rotation.

In 1851, however, Fou-
cault (see 1849) suspended
a large iron ball, about 2
feet in diameter and
weighing 62 pounds, from a
steel wire more than 200
feet long, hanging inside
the dome of a large church.

The pendulum ended in a
spike that just cleared the
floor but would score a
mark in the sand with
which the floor was sprin-
kled.

The iron ball was
drawn far to one side and
tied to the wall by a cord.
To prevent vibration when
the ball was released, the
cord was not cut, but set on
fire. The swinging pendu-
lum would then remain in
the same plane, but the
Earth, as it rotated, would
change its orientation. If
the pendulum had been at
the North Pole, for exam-
ple, the pendulum would
have seemed to change its
plane through a complete
circle in 24 hours. At the lat-
itude of Paris, the change
would have taken 31

hours and 47 minutes.
Thus the spectators were
actually watching the
Earth rotate under the pen-
dulum.

Ariel and
Umbriel

The last large satellite, Tri-
ton, had been discovered by
Lassell five years before
(see 1846), but there were
smaller satellites to be
found. In 1848 Lassell had
discovered an eighth satel-
lite of Saturn, which he
named Hyperion after still
another of Saturn’s (Cro-
nos’s) brother-Titans in the
ancient myths. This satel-
lite was discovered almost
simultaneously by the
American astronomer
