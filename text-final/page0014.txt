Pottery

It has always been im-
portant for human beings
to carry things, and the ob-
vious way to carry them is
in the hands, or in the
crook of the arm. There is a
limit to how much can be
carried in this fashion, how-
ever. What we needed were
artificial hands, so to speak,
that were considerably
larger than our natural
hands.

Objects could be car-
ried in hides, but hides are
an inconvenient shape and
heavy. Gourds might do,
but they have to be taken
as they come. Eventually
human beings learned to
weave twigs or other fibers
into baskets. These were
light and could be made in
any shape.

Baskets, however, were
only useful in carrying

solid, dry objects made up
of particles considerably
larger than the interstices
of the weave. Baskets could
not be used to carry flour or
olive oil, for instance, or
most important, water.

It might seem natural
to daub baskets with clay,
which upon drying would
cake the holes and make
the basket solid. The dried
mud would tend to fall
away, however, especially
if the basket was shaken or
struck. But if the basket
was placed in the sun and
allowed to bake in direct
sunlight, the mud would
harden further, and the bas-
ket might then become
fairly serviceable for car-
rying powders and fluids.

But then why use the
basket? Why not simply
begin with clay, mold a con-
tainer out of it, and let it
dry in the sun? You would

then have a pot made of
crude earthenware, and
some of these may have
been formed as early as
9000 B.c. Such pots are soft,
however, and don't last
long.

Some stronger heat
was required. When earth-
enware was placed in the
fire, it became hard pottery,
and such pottery can be
traced back to perhaps
7000 B.c. This may have
been the first use of fire for
something other than light,
heat, and cooking.

Pottery not only made
it possible to carry liquids,
it also introduced a new
form of cooking. Until then,
food had usually been
roasted, exposed directly to
the flames or to dry heat.
Once a pot existed that
could hold water and with-
stand the heat of flames,
food could be heated in the
