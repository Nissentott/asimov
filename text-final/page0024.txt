for one city-state to keep its
irrigation ditches and
levees in tip-top shape if
another one upstream
allowed its own to go to
pieces and produce an un-
timely flood, or cut the flow
of water downstream.
There was therefore
pressure for union, and this
was carried out first in
Egypt. The ease of commu-
nication along the Nile

3000 B.C.

tended to even out differ-
ences, and all the city-
states for 500 miles along
the river had the same cul-
ture and the same lan-
guage.

About 3100 B.C., the
city-states of the Nile delta
(lower Egypt) were united
with those south of the
delta (upper Egypt) under
the rule of Menes, the first
king of the First Dynasty.
(An Egyptian priest,

Manetho, about 300 B.c.,
wrote a history of Egypt
and divided its rulers into
dynasties, each one repre-
senting a family whose
members ruled over Egypt
for a period of time.)

Since the Egyptian
city-states shared a com-
mon language and culture,
Egypt can be viewed as
what we would today call a
nation. It was the first na-
tion the world had seen.

Oil lamps had been used

for thousands more, but the
