In this way stews and casse-

roles came into existence

And of course pottery
could be decorated and
well shaped. Cleverly decor
ated examples would be in
special demand. Artisans
could exchange them for
other material they found
needful. And since pottery
lasts indefinitely, if well
cared for, it can change
hands often, and one group
of people can use it in trad-
ing with another group

In early pottery, the
clay was pressed and

pounded into the shape of a
pot and the result was
something quite lumpy and
asymmetric but service-
able.

If the pot could be
turned, however, a rela-
tively light pressure from
the hand would produce a
symmetrical cylindrical
shape, and by appropriate
increases in pressure or by
downward pushes, compli-
cated modifications of the
basic cylinder could be
made while retaining sym-
metry. This could be done
if the clay was placed on a

 

horizontal, circular slab of
wood or stone (a patter
wheel), which had a central

spike underneath that

 

could be balanced in a de
pression and the whole
turned rapidly

The potter’s wheel was

 

one of the first examples ol
the use of a wheel and onge
of the first uses of rotary

motion. We don't
when it was first used, but
it may have led to the idea

Linen

Flax produces a fiber that
can be interwoven much as
twigs or bark might be in-
terwoven to form a basket.
To make a strong thread, a
number of flax fibers would
be twisted together. We call
the result linen. (Like the
word linen, the word line
comes from the word for
" fax,”)

The first use of linen,
perhaps as early as 6000
B.C., was to produce linen

cords that could be used in
fishing. Interweaving these
cords produced nets
Eventually very fine
nets were made—in other
words, cloth,
(from a Latin word for
“weaving"). The formation

then, furred hides had been
worn. These were all right
in cold temperatures but

too hot at other times. They
weren 't porous, they were
