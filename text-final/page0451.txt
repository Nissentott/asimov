to wangle an assignment to
Java.

He had incredible luck,
for in 1890, not long after
reaching Java, he discov-
ered a skullcap, a thigh-
bone, and two teeth of what
was undoubtedly the most
primitive humanlike organ-
ism (hominid) that had yet
been found. It was clear, for
instance, that the brain was
only three-fifths the size of
a modern human being's.

Dubois called the or-
ganism Pithecanthropus
erectus (erect ape-human),
since the thighbone was suf-
ficiently human to signify
that the hominid had
walked erect as we do. The
existence of this hominid
was a powerful argument
in favor of evolution.

Spectro-
heliograph

For three-quarters of a cen-
tury, the solar spectrum
had been studied in increas-
ing detail, but always the
Sun had been photo-

graphed by light from the
entire spectrum.

In 1890 an American as-
tronomer, George Ellery
Hale (1868—1938), per-
fected and put into use the
spectroheliograph, a device
that made it possible to
photograph the light of a
small band of wavelengths
of the Sun. Thus he was
able to photograph the
wavelengths around a line
emitted by calcium and the
result was a clear indica-
tion of the distribution of
calcium in the solar atmo-
sphere. It now became pos-
sible to study the chemistry
of the Sun’s outermost
layer in considerable detail.

 

Surgical Gloves

As the danger of infection
became better and better
understood, surgeons went
to increasing lengths to pre-
vent it, and in ne cases
very simple precautions
turned out to be enor-
mously useful

An American surgeon,
William Stewart Halsted

  

  

(1852-1922), sugg
nurses wear rubber gloves
to protect their hands
against contact dermatitis
It then oceurred to him
that rubber gloves were
more easily sterilized than
human hands were, and
that if the gloves were thin
enough, they would not se-
riously cut down on the
hand’s delicacy of touch.

In 1890 Halsted be-
came the first surgeon of
importance to wear rubber
gloves during an operation,
and this innovation was
rapidly adopted. It marked
the transition from anti
tic surgery (killing the
cerms that were present) to
aseptic surgery (in which
the germs weren't allowed
to get there in the first
place).

Also in 1890 Halsted
perfected the technique of
radical mastectomy (cut-
ting off the breast and the
muscles underneath) to pre-
vent the spread of breast
cancer to other parts of the
body, where it would surely
be fatal
