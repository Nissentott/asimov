 

retain a monopoly of the

tin ore, but it is thought
that they reached Cornwall,
at the southwestern tip of
England, where tin ore was
produced right into modern
times.

By 500 B.c., the Phoeni-
cians are even reported to
have circumnavigated Af-
rica, a voyage that took
them three years. The
Greek historian Herodotus
(ca. 484—between 430 and
420 B.c.), writing half a cen-
tury later, described the
voyage but doubted the
whole thing because the
Phoenicians reported that
in the far south the noon-
day Sun was in the north-
ern half of the sky.
Herodotus felt this to be im-
possible.

We moderns, however,
know that the Sun is al-
ways in the northern half of
the sky when seen from the
South Temperate Zone. The
Phoenicians would not
have made up such an ap-
parently ridiculous story if
they had not actually wit-
nessed it, so the very item
that caused Herodotus
to doubt the story con-
vinees us that it must be
true.

Dissection

The interior of a human
body cannot ordinarily be
seen. Animals, however,
have been butchered since

dim prehistory, so that
much was known of animal
organs. There were also sug-
gestions that one could fore-
tell the future by studying
animal livers, for instance,
which meant that studies of
animal anatomy (from
Greek words meaning “to
cut up”) were more de-
tailed and careful than one
would expect from the pro-
cess of butchering.

However, one cannot
treat a dead human being
as one would treat a dead
animal. There is a feeling
that human beings should
be treated with respect,
even if dead. Some human
beings might be hurt and
cut open in the course of
wars, private fights, or
hunting, but the studies
this made possible could
only be limited and unsys-
tematic.

A Greek physician, Alc-
maeon (6th century B.c.)
was the first to take the
chance of deliberately and
carefully dissecting human
cadavers, possibly about
500 B.c. In this way, he
could see the difference be-
tween arteries and veins
and tell that the sense or-
gans were connected to the
brain by nerves.

Abacus

No one knows when the
abacus first came into use,
but it was probably known

in Egypt at least as long
ago as 500 B.c.

It consists essentially
of rows of beads, some-
times strung on wires. In
the simplest form there are
ten beads on each wire, the
first row being units, the
second row being tens, the
third row being hundreds
and so on.

The beads can be ma-
nipulated much as we ma-
nipulate the fingers on a
hand in simple adding and
subtracting. The advantage
is that you may have nine
or ten "“hands” present as
so many rows of beads, and
the movements you make
are easier and quicker than
manipulating your fingers
would be.

A skilled operator can
use the abacus flashingly to
multiply, to divide, and 1o
perform many complicated
arithmetical manipula-
tions, It was the first really
important computing de-
vice worked out by human
beings.

Venus

The Greeks were not, at
first, as advanced in astron-
omy as the Babylonians
were. They knew the eve-
ning star, a bright planet
that appeared in the west-
ern sky aflter sunset, and
they called it Hesperos (the
Greek word for “evening'').
There was also a morning
