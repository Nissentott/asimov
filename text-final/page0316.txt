shape of a horseshoe. His
device would lift 9 pounds
—twenty times its own
weight—while the current
was running. When the cur-
rent was turned off, the
magnetic properties van-
ished. Sturgeon had in-
vented the electromagnet.

It was quickly im-

proved upon by the Ameri-
can physicist Joseph Henry
(1797-1878), who in 1829
wrapped insulated wire
around an iron core. This
meant that many more
turns of wire could be
wrapped about the core,
since crisscrossing them
would not produce a short

circuit. The more turns of
wire, the stronger the mag-
netic field when the current
was running. By 1831,
using the current from an
ordinary battery, Henry
could make an electromag-
net lift a ton of iron.

Portland
Cement

The Romans used concrete
for their structures, this
being sand, gravel, or
crushed rock held together
by cement, a mixture of
chemicals that hardened
when water was added.
The first improvement
on the Roman system came
in 1824, when an English
stonemason, Joseph Aspdin
(1799-1855), invented a
method for grinding and
burning clay and limestone
to produce a cement that

was both cheaper and bet-
ter than other cements in
use at the time. He called it
Portland cement in an at-
tempt to emphasize its re-
semblance to Portland
stone quarried at Portland,
Dorset.

Steam Engine
Efficiency

The steam engine, however
useful, remained inefficient.
With all Watt’s improve-
ments (see 1764), it still con-
verted only 7 percent of the
energy of burning fuel into

work. The remaining 93
percent (or more) was sim-
ply lost as waste heat.

The first to study steam
engine efficiency scientifi-
cally was a French physi-
cist, Nicolas-Léonard-Sadi
Carnot (1796—1832). In
1824 he published a book
entitled On the Motive
Power of Fire in which he
was able to show that the
maximum efficiency of a
steam engine depended
upon the difference in tem-
perature between the steam
at its hottest and the cold
water at its coldest. It does
not matter what happens at
