Egypt thus had a most

convenient form of commu-

nication that perhaps ac-
counted for its slowness to
adopt the Sumerian
wheeled cart. Egypt had
scarcely any need for land
transportation.

By 0 B.c. Egyptian

 

boats had begun to ply the
Nile, and by 3000 B.c. they
were venturing out of the
Nile into the Mediterra-
1ean, hugging the shore,

 

and making their way past
Sinai and Canaan to Leba-
non. There they obtained
the tree-trunks they lacked
in Egypt and brought them
back for construction pur-
poses.

Writing

Because Sumeria was the
most advanced and com-
plex civilization in the
world, life was more com-

 

 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 

plex too. People had to keep
track of the grain they pro-

traded, what they bought
and sold, and what they
contributed to the common
fund (in what we call taxes).

It became more and
more difficult to keep it all
in mind. We can say this
without casting aspersions
on the extraordinary pow-
ers of a trained memory. It
was necessary to keep
score.

Almost anyone can
think of making some sort
of mark in the ground to
stand for a basket full of
fruit and then eventually
counting the marks in
order to know how many
baskets have been deliv-
ered. Itâ€™s just that if society
is simple, there is no need
to take the trouble to do
this.

However, as the mem-
ory becomes strained, such
marks are made. In order
to simplify matters, differ-
ent marks would be made
for one, five, and ten, per-
haps so that there would
not be too many unit-marks
to count. This would lead
on to a mark that meant
fruit and another that
meant grain and still an-
other that meant man and
so on. Eventually there
would be marks, perhaps
crude pictures at first, for
every different object. If dif-
ferent people agree on the
marks and learn how to
