self suspected that quanta
might be only a mathemati-
cal device that had no phys-
ical meaning.

Nevertheless, the quan-
tum theory, as it is now
called, proved so fundamen-
tal that all physics prior to
1900 is called classical phys-
ics and all physics after
1900 modern physics.

For his work, Planck re-
ceived the Nobel Prize for
physics in 1918.

Mass Increase

Lorentz had maintained
that mass increased with
velocity (see 1895). It did
not seem at the time that
this could ever be checked,
for the velocities needed to
make the change in mass
measurable were too huge
to deal with in the labora-
tory.

As physicists began to
study the speeding elec-
trons involved in cathode
rays, and in other phenom-
ena, however, it turned out
that electrons might be
moving at respectable frac-
tions of the speed of light—
up to 90 percent in some
cases. This meant the mass
increase ought to be mea-
surable, since fast elec-
trons, becoming more
massive than slow ones,
would bend less sharply in
response to electromag-
netic fields. This turned out
to be so, and the increase in

mass, measured in 1900 for
the first time, matched
quite closely the theoretical
predictions of Lorentz.

The Lorentz-FitzGerald
contraction was borne out,
but physicists had to wait
five more years before a
comprehensive physical
theory that explained it
was advanced.

Beta Particles

Becquerel, who had discov-
ered uranium radiations
(see 1896) continued to
study them. The beta rays
were clearly composed of
negatively charged beta par-
ticles, and from the way
these curved in a magnetic
field of a particular
strength, they seemed to re-
semble electrons. In 1900,
after a close study of the
properties of beta particles,
Becquerel decided that
they were electrons.

Until then, electrons
had seemed to be associ-
ated only with electric cur-
rents, as in the case of
cathode rays. Now it
seemed they were associ-
ated with atoms as well—
at least with radioactive
atoms.

Gamma Rays

In 1900 the French physi-
cist Paul Ulrich Villard
(1860—1934), studying the
radiations from uranium
that Becquerel had discov-

ered, noted that in addition
to alpha rays and beta rays,
there was some radiation
that was totally unaffected
by magnets.

This, it was decided,
consisted of electromag-
netic radiation. Its proper-
ties were very much like
those of X rays, but it was
even more penetrating and
therefore even shorter in
wavelength. It came to be
called gamma rays, after
the third letter of the Greek
alphabet.

Radon

A German physicist,
Friedrich Ernst Dorn
(1848-1916), studying the
radium that Curie had dis-
covered (see 1898), found in
1900 that it gave off not
only radiations but a gas
that was itself radioactive.
The gas was called radium
emanation at first, but on
closer study it turned out to
be a noble gas (see 1898),
the sixth one, and was
named radon.

Atomic Change

In 1900 Crookes (see 1861)
found that it was possible
to treat a solution of ura-
nium compound in such a
way that part of it would
be removed as an insoluble
material. The removed por-
tion was an impurity, the
uranium compound itself
remaining in solution.
