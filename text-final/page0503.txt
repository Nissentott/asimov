ited the Zeeman effect (see
1896). That indicated that
they were subjected to a
strong electromagnetic
field. It was the first time
such a field had been de-
tected for any astronomical
object but Earth itself,

Rickettsia

The American pathologist
Howard Taylor Ricketts
(1871--1910) was investigat-
ing the serious disease of
Rocky Mountain spotted
fever. In 1906 he had shown
that it was spread by cattle
ticks.

In 1908 he finally lo-
cated the pathogenic agent
and found it to resemble a
rather small bacterial cell.
It was not, however, a com-
plete cell, capable of inde-
pendent life and growth.
Apparently it lacked some
essential components of
life, and like a virus, could
only grow inside a cell,
where it could make use of
the cellular machinery to
eke out its own deficiencies.

These agents, which
came to be called rickettsia,
in honor of the discoverer,
were therefore intermedi-
ate between viruses and
bacteria.

Assembly Line

During the first twenty
years of its existence, the
automobile had been im-
proved greatly and manu-

 

factured in greater
numbers. It remained very
largely a toy of the rich,
however, rather as yachts
are today.

The man who changed
that was the American in-
dustrialist Henry Ford
(1863—1947). He had built
his first automobile in 1893
and started a car-manufac-
turing company in 1899.
His aim was to produce
cars in quantity (mass pro-
duction) and to make them
cheaply enough to put
them within reach of mid-
dle-class Americans.

His key innovation
came in 1908, when he
thought of dividing the
manufacture of cars into
steps, each of which could
be performed simply by a
single worker. He then
placed the future car on a
moving belt that brought it
to different workers in suc-
cession, each of whom per-
formed the assigned task
over and over, with all nec-
essary tools and parts
within reach. What started
at one end of the assembly
line was a mere skeleton of
a car, What rolled off the
other end was a complete,
functioning automobile, in-
cluding a gasoline supply
so that it could be driven
away.

Ford produced a series
of models identified by let-
ters of the alphabet and fi-
nally considered the Model
T suitable for mass-produc-

tion. It cost only $950 to
begin with, but the price
dropped in succeeding
years, eventually reaching
a low of $290. For the first
time, the average man
could afford to buy a car,
and the automobile age—
still in full swing today—
began.

Haber Process

Nitrogen is absolutely es-
sential to life, and also to
explosives. Hellriegel had
discovered that leguminous
plants could fix atmo-
spheric nitrogen and keep
soil fertile (see 1886), but
that was a slow process and
would not suffice for the
manufacture of explosives
in the quantities that a war
economy required.
Nitrogen in its most us-
able form exists in nature
as nitrates in the soil. Ni-
trates are therefore sought
after, both for fertilizers
and for explosives. Ni-
trates, however, are uni-
formly soluble and tend to
be leached out of the soil by
rainfall. One can therefore
expect a reliable source of
nitrates to be found chiefly
in desert areas such as
those in northern Chile.
Germany, anticipating
possible war with Great
Britain, knew that British
control of the seas would
prevent Chilean nitrates
from reaching Germany, re-
ducing Germany's ability
