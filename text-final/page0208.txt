water, and ammonium
chloride, which resulted in
the lowest temperature he
could get, and he called
that 0. A mixture of ice and
water he set at 32, and the

1715

temperature of boiling
water was then 212. This is
the Fahrenheit scale, and it
is still commonly used in
the United States to mea-

sure temperature.

The Fahrenheit ther-
mometer was the first that
could measure temperature
with sufficient accuracy to
be useful to scientists.

 

 

Solar Eclipse

On April 22, 1715, a solar
eclipse was to take place
and the path of totality was
to cross Great Britain and
parts of Europe. It had been
twenty-three centuries
since Thales had predicted
an eclipse (see 585 B.c.) and
it was perfectly understood
by astronomers that

eclipses were phenomena
that were natural, harm-
less, and splendid. Never-
theless, superstition is
immortal, and in order to
prevent as much panic as
possible, Halley (see 1678)
carefully plotted out the
path the eclipse would take
and prepared maps of it
well in adyance so that
everyone knew exactly

when he or she would see
the Sun lose its light.
Halley also organized a
large number of observers
throughout Europe to
watch and time the eclipse.
This was the first eclipse
for which astronomers
turned out en masse. From
this point on, every eclipse
would bring its crowd of ob-
serving astronomers.
