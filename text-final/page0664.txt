First he tried his prepa-
ration (Salk vaccine) on chil-
dren who had recovered
from polio, to see if it
raised the antibody con-
tent. Then in 1953 he dared
to try it on children who
had not had the disease, to
see if antibodies would de-
velop. They did, and within
two years mass inoculation
had begun. The dread dis-
ease became a thing of the
past.

Kidney
Transplant

When a vital human organ
fails, death may be pre-
vented if another organ can
be transplanted. The trans-
planted organ may come
from a living human being
who can spare it, or from a
human being dead in an ac-
cident so recent that the
organ is still viable.

Unfortunately, human
beings are allergic to one
another, and the donated
organ tends to be rejected,
although scientists like
Medawar (see 1949) were
striving to find ways of re-
ducing this tendency.

The first successful kid-
ney transplant took place
in December 1954 in Bos-
ton, from one identical
twin to another. Since iden-
tical twins have the same
genetic makeup, they have

very little tendency to re-
ject each other's organs. If
one twin has two bad kid-
neys and the other two
good ones, one of the good
pair (which the donor can
spare) can keep the dying
twin alive. In this case, the
twin that received the kid-
ney lived on for eight years.

Many other kidney
transplants have been car-
ried through since, some-
times with considerable
success, even among other
than identical twins.

Controlled
Fission Reactors

Even before the first fission
bomb had been exploded, a
controlled nuclear reactor
(although a very inefficient
one) had been set up in Chi-
cago in 1942. Its only func-
tion was to show that a
fission bomb was possible.
Efforts were later
made, however, to devise
nuclear reactors efficient
enough to serve as reason-
able sources of controlled
energy for peaceful uses.
The fissioning uranium or
plutonium would liberate
heat at a moderate rate,
and this heat would turn
water into steam, which
would turn a turbine and
produce electricity.
Naturally, methods
had to be devised to slow
the fission reaction if it
showed signs of proceeding

too quickly and producing
enough heat to result in a
meltdown. A controlled nu-
clear reactor could not ex-
plode, since it was not
enclosed strongly enough to
build up the kind of heat
and force that would lead
to an explosion. It would,
however, be capable of re-
leasing a surge of nuclear
radiation into the environ-
ment, so the pressure for
safe operation was there-
fore strong.

The first nuclear reac-
tor built to produce electric
power for civilian use was
put into action in the So-
viet Union in June 1954. It
was a very small one.
Larger reactors were pro-
duced in Great Britain and
in the United States soon
after, and eventually they
were distributed around
the globe and began to con-
tribute substantially to the
world’s energy supply, par-
ticularly in France and the
Soviet Union.

Controlled reactors
also came into use in an-
other way. Submarines
throughout both world
wars had remained vulne-
rable because they had to
surface periodically to
recharge their batteries.
Under the driving force of
the Polish-born American
naval officer Hyman
George Rickover (1900—
1986), a plan developed to
equip American subma-
rines with atomic reactors,
