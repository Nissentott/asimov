sides, there is the evidence
of the eyes. One can see
how maggots, for instance,
arise out of decaying meat.
The meat is dead but gives
rise to living maggots.
Spontaneous generation
seems unquestionable.

In 1668, however, the
Italian physician Francesco
Redi (1626—-1697) decided
to test the matter experi-
mentally.

He prepared eight
flasks with a variety of
meats in them. Four he
sealed and four he left open
to the air. Flies could land
only on the meat in the
open vessels, and only
those bred maggots. The
meat in the closed vessels
turned just as putrid—but
no maggots.

To test whether it was
the absence of fresh air that
did it, Redi repeated the ex-
periments without sealing
any flasks but covering four
with gauze instead. The air
was not excluded from the
gauze-covered flasks, but

 

flies were, and there were
no maggots in those flasks.

 

(This was the first clear-cut
case of the use of proper
controls in a biological ex-
periment.)

Redi concluded that
maggots did not arise by
spontaneous generation but
hatched [rom eggs laid by
flies, eggs too small to be
easily visible. This did not
settle the matter generally,
but it was difficult thereaf-
ter Lo believe that life forms
large enough to be visible
to the unaided eye arose by
spontaneous generation.

 

Reflecting
Telescopes

During the first sixty years
of the telescope’s use, its
lenses curved light by re-
fraction and focused it. In
this way, the eye saw the
image as brightened and ex-
panded. Such telescopes
were refracting telescopes.
Unfortunately, the
lenses refracted different
colors of light differently
and formed a spectrum, so
that the images in such tele-

scopes were always blurred
by colored rings, red or
blue (chromatic aberration).
This was minimized by
using only the center of the
lens and having the light
come together only g
ally and reach a [ocus
considerable distance from
the lens, but this meant
that telescopes capable of

  

considerable brightening
and enlargement had to be
long and unwieldy.

Newton, through his
experiments with light (see
1666), supposed that one
couldn’t possibly have a
lens without blurring the
image with color. He there-
fore thought of an alterna-
tive. Why not use curved
mirrors instead of curved
lenses, and focus the light
by reflection rather than re-
fraction? Reflection did not
produce a spectrum.

In 1668, therefore, he
built the first reflecting tele-
scope, and thereafter two
