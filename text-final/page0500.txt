be a “magic bullet” that
could kill the pathogen
while leaving the human
patient largely unaffected.

By 1907 he had located
a dye called Trypan red that
combined with and killed
trypanosomes, a type of
protozoa that caused sleep-
ing sickness. Trypan red
was therefore a possible
cure for the disease.

This development of
chemotherapy earned Ehr-
lich a share of the Nobel
Prize in physiology and
medicine in 1908.

Fruit Flies

Mendel had worked out the
laws of inheritance by
studying pea plants (see
1865), and these laws had
been verified for animals by
Bateson (see 1902). How-
ever, animals are much
harder to work with on the
whole than plants are.

In 1907, however, the
American geneticist
Thomas Hunt Morgan
(1866—-1945) began to use a
tiny insect called Drosoph-
ila, or fruit fly. They have
only four chromosome
pairs in each cell, are sim-
ple to feed, and breed
readily and copiously at
brief intervals.

In studying them, Mor-
gan found that there were
characteristics that were
linked and inherited to-

gether, but that the linkage
was not necessarily perma-
nent, Every once in a while,
two characteristics that
had previously been inher-
ited together were suddenly
inherited independently.
He was able to correlate -
this with the fact that chro-
mosomes sometimes inter-
changed parts so that two
characteristics ordinarily
on the same chromosome
came to be on different
chromosomes.

Fruit fly research
greatly hastened the pace
at which knowledge of ge-
netic mechanisms in-
creased. For his work with
them, Morgan was awarded
the Nobel Prize for medi-
cine and physiology in
1933.

Tissue Culture

If intact animals are hard
to study, might it be possi-
ble to take small sections of
tissues and keep them alive
and growing? In this way,
it might be possible to
study the growth, develop-
ment, and functioning of
cells, as well as changes in
their organization. Eventu-
ally, this technique offered
a method for the cultiva-
tion and study of microor-
ganisms that would not
grow on grosser, simpler
media.

The first to culture tis-
sues successfully was an

American zoologist, Ross
Granville Harrison (1870—
1959). He cultivated tad-
pole tissue and found that
nerve fibers grew from it.
He was able to study the
protoplasmic movements
within the fibers, and this
served as the foundation for
later studies on nerve physi-
ology.

Conditioned
Response

Salivation at the sight of
food is an unconditioned re-
sponse. It is brought about
by the construction of the
nerve network with which
the organism is born. In
1907 Pavlov (see 1902)
began an attempt to see if
he could impose a new pat-
tern upon such inborn ones,

Thus, a hungry dog
that is shown food will sali-
vate. If a bell is made to
ring every time the dog is
shown food, the dog will
eventually salivate when
the bell rings even when
food is not shown. The dog
has associated the sound of
the bell with the sight of
food and reacts to the first
as though it were the sec-
ond. This is a conditioned re-
sponse.

Studies of the condi-
tioned response led to the
thought that a good part of
learning and of the devel-
opment of behavor is the
