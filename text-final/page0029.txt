Horses

Until now, the animals that
had been used for pulling
carts and ploughs were
oxen and donkeys. The ox
was strong, but it was lum-
bering, stupid, and slow.
The donkey was more intel-
ligent, but it was smaller
and weaker than the ox.
Neither could pull the
heavy, solid-wheeled carts
rapidly.

Ammal transport could
not be used in warfare with
any great success, there-
fore. Armies consisted of
masses of foot soldiers, who
slogged into each other,
wielding spears and swords
and cowering behind their
shields, until one side or
the other broke and ran.
The carts could serve only
as a ceremonial means of
keeping the ruler and other
military leaders from walk-
ing, or to carry arms and
supplies.

But then, about 2000
B.C., a flect beast was tamed

—the wild horse—and not
by any of the civilizations
but by nomadic dwellers in
the steppes of what we now
call Iran, The horse was
larger and stronger than
the donkey, and faster and
more intelligent than the
ox. At first, though, it
seemed useless for trans-
port, for it was difficult to
harness. A harness that was
suitable for an ox placed
pressure on the horse’s
windpipe and cut its speed.
Then, some time before
1800 B.c., someone devised
a method of using the horse
for specialized light trac-
tion. A cart was made as
light as possible, becoming
scarcely more than a small
platform between two large
wheels, a platform just
large enough to hold a
human being. Even the
wheels were lightened,
without loss of strength, by
being made spoked rather
than solid, and they were
so fixed to the axle that
they could turn individu-

ally. The result was a char-
iot (a word not too different
from cart).

A horse, or horses, pull-
ing so light a load could
run fleetly, much faster
than a foot soldier could.
With only two wheels, the
chariot was almost as ma-
neuverable as the horse it-
self and could skid into a
new direction with little
trouble.

1t did not take long for
the nomads to discover that
a body of charioteers, driv-
ing in fiercely, could not be
stopped by the foot soldiers
of the day, Indeed, foot sol-
diers broke and fled in hor-
ror at the first sight of the
animals thundering toward
them.

This is the first clear
case we have of a new war
weapon catching those
without it by surprise and
bestowing a kind of univer-
sal victory on those who
had it. The raiding nomads
ripped into the Tigris-
Euphrates valley, which
