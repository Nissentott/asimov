 

Mons, reached a height of
15 miles above base level
and had a base width of
about 250 miles.

The atmosphere was
only about one-hundredth
the density of Earthâ€™s and
consisted almost entirely of
carbon dioxide. The tem-
perature was too low for lig-
uid water to exist at any
time, and the ice caps of
Mars may contain both fro-
zen water and frozen car-
bon dioxide.

Moon Rocks

Exploration of the Moon
continued in 1971. Apollo
14 reached the Moon on
February 5, 1971, and its
crew collected 98 pounds of
Moon rocks that were
brought back to Earth for
analysis. They were the
first samples of material
collected by human beings
on another world.

On July 30, 1971,
Apollo 15 landed on the
Moon. It carried with it a
lunar rover, a land vehicle
designed to travel on the
airless Moon. The astro-
nauts traveled 17 miles
using it and brought
back more Moon rocks to
Earth.

Space Station

On April 19, 1971, the So-
viet Union placed Salyur 1
in orbit. It was the proto-

type of a space station in-
tended for long-time
habitation by relay teams
of cosmonauts.

In July, however, three
Soviel cosmonauts were
found dead on board when
the rocket Soyiiz 11 re-
turned to Earth, because of
loss of air from the cabin. It
was the worst space disas-
ter up to that point.

Black Hole
Detection

In 1971 an X-ray-detecting
satellite found irregular
changes in an X-ray source
in the constellation of Cyg-
nus, a source that had been
named Cygnus X-1. Such ir-
regular changes might be
the result of matter circling
a black hole in varying con-
centrations.

Cygnus X-1 was at once
investigated with great
care and found to exist in
the immediate neighbor-
hood of a large, hot, blue
star about thirty times as
massive as our Sun. The Ca-
nadian astronomer C. T.
Bolt showed that this star
and Cygnus X-1 were re-
volving about each other,
and from the nature of the
orbit, Cygnus X-1 had to be
five to eight times as mas-
sive as our Sun, If Cygnus
X-1 were a normal star, it
would be easily visible.

Since it was not, it must be
a small, very dense object.
It was too massive to be a
neutron star, so it must be
a black hole. Though this
is not a clear-cut and abso-
lute identification, astron-
omers are by and large
satisfied that it is a

black hole.

Since then, black holes
have been observed, by sim-
ilar indirect and not en-
tirely reliable means, to
exist in the centers of vari-
ous galaxies, including per-
haps our own.

Mini-Black
Holes

Hawking had proposed that
black holes slowly evapo-
rated and that the evapora-
tion increased as mass
decreased (see 1970). In
1971 he pointed out that

at the time of the big

bang, black holes of all
sizes might have been
created.

Some would be so
small that the evaporation
rate would be high enough
to cause the last bit of ex-
plosive evaporation to take
place right now, some 15
billion vears after forma-
tion. Such mini-black holes
might be common, and
their existence could be
proved from the specific
characteristics of that final
explosion.
