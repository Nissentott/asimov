Quinine

The Incas had used the
bark of the cinchona tree as
a treatment for malaria.
The active ingredient in it
eventually came to be
known as quinine. The first
knowledge of quinine
reached Europe in 1642,
and for three centuries it re-
mained the only treatment
for this common and debili-
tating disease. Without qui-
nine, it is doubtful if
Europeans could have

long remained in tropical
climates.

Adding
Machine

In 1642 the French mathe-
matician Blaise Pascal
(1623-1662) invented a cal-
culating machine that
could add and subtract. It
had wheels that each had 1
to 10 marked off along its
circumference. When the
wheel at the right, repre-
senting units, made one
complete circle, it engaged
the wheel to its left, repre-
senting tens, and moved it
forward one notch.

With such a machine,
as long as the correct num-
bers were entered into the

device, there was no possi-
bility of a mistake,

He patented the final
version in 1649, but it was
a commercial failure. It
was too expensive, and
most people continued to
add and subtract on their
fingers, on an abacus, or on
a sheet of paper.

South Pacific

The ancient Greeks had
thought there might be a
large continent in the south-
ern hemisphere to balance
the land they knew in the
northern hemisphere. This
was pure speculation, but
the later Europeans took
Greek speculation seri-
ously.

Both South America
and Africa extended into
the southern hemisphere,
but they didn't seem to ful-
fill the requirements. There
ought to be a continent that
was entirely in the south-
ern hemisphere. The Pacific
Ocean was clearly vast, cov-
ering nearly half the area of
the globe. Since Magellan
had first entered it (sec
1523), no significant land
area had been found, but lit-
tle of it had as yet been ex-
plored.

The Indonesian islands,

which straddled the Equa-
tor, seemed a good place to
start. In 1606 a Spanish
navigator, Luis Vaez de Tor-
res (fl. 1606), sailed all
around the island of New
Guinea and showed that it
was not part of a continen-
tal landmass. It proved to
be the second-largest island
in the world. The narrow
stretch of water south of
New Guinea is called Torres
Strair in the explorer’s
honor.

When the Dutch be-
came dominant in the Indo-
nesian islands, the Dutch
governor-general Anthony
van Diemen (1593-1645)
sent out an exploring expe-
dition under Abel Janszoon
Tasman (1603?-1659).

On August 14, 1641,
Tasman left the island of
Java and for ten months
sailed the Pacific. He dis-
covered an island he named
Van Diemen’s Land, in
honor of his chief, but it is
now known as Tasmania in
his own honor. He also dis-
covered the southern island
of what is now known as
New Zealand.

The astonishing thing
about Torres's and Tas-
man’s voyages is that nei-
ther managed to spot
Australia, a picce of land as
