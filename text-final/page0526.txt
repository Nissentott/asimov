Acetylcholine

A fungus called ergot pro-
duces a variety of alkaloids
with powerful effects on an-
imal tissues. The eating of
fungus-ridden grain can
produce a disease called er-
gotism, and in the centuries
before the cause was under-
stood, there were terrible
epidemics of ergotism.

Among those who
worked on ergot was a Brit-
ish biologist, Henry Hallett
Dale (1875-1968).In 1914
he isolated from it a com-
pound called acetylcholine,
which seemed to produce
effects on organs similar to
those produced by certain
nerves. The significance of
this was not fully under-
stood for several more
years.

Earthâ€™s Mantle
and Core

The waves set up by earth-
quakes apparently did not
reach all parts of the
Earth's surface even when
they were strong enough to
be detected everywhere.

 

There was a shadow zone
within which no waves
were detectable.

The German-born
American geologist Beno
Gutenberg (1889-1960),
studying this phenomenon,
suggested in 1914 that
there was a core at the cen-
ter of the Earth, about 2100
miles in radius, that was
markedly different in den-
sity and chemical composi-
tion from the material
outside that radius. Earth-
quake waves entering the
core would be refracted in
such a way as to be sent be-
yond the shadow zone.
Based on the fact that trans-
verse waves did not enter
the core at all, Gutenberg
suggested that the core was
liquid.

Thus the Earth is di-
vided into two parts, an

inner core, which (from its
high density, and the fact
that iron meteorites are
common) seems likely to
consist of liquid nickel-iron
ina 1-to-9 ratio, and an
outer mantle made up of
rocky material. These two
are in about the proportion
of yolk to white in an egg,
and the outermost crust is
about the proportion of the
eggshell.

The sharp dividing line
between the mantle and the
core is called the Gutenberg
discontinuity.

Behaviorism

Freudian psychology (see
1893 and 1900, Dreams)
had grown extremely popu-
lar by this time, but those
who favored other views
were not wanting. In 1914
