Genetics

There was a flaw in Dar-
win's theory of evolution by
natural selection (see 1858).
Granted that in every gener-
ation of a particular species
there are random varia-
tions, there are also (to
some extent, at least) ran-
dom matings. Therefore,
the variations should tend
to vanish into an average,
since extremes are not
likely to mate with similar
extremes. (It might even be
argued that the second law
of thermodynamics re-
quires this tending toward
an average.)

The flaw was corrected
by an Austrian botanist and
Augustinian monk, Gregor
Johann Mendel (1822—
1884), who experimented
with peas that he grew in
the monastery garden.

Carefully, Mendel ar-
ranged for various plants to
self-pollinate, wrapping
them to guard against acci-
dental pollination by in-
sects. Carefully, he saved
the seeds produced by each
self-pollinated plant,
planted them separately,
and studied the new genera-
tion.

Mendel found that if he
planted seeds from dwarf

pea plants, only dwarf pea
plants sprouted. The seeds
produced by this second
generation also produced
only dwarf pea plants. The
dwarf pea plants “bred
true.”

Seeds from tall pea
plants behaved in a more
complicated fashion. Some
bred true, but some did
not. Those that did not
breed true gave rise to tall
plants three-quarters of the
time and to dwarf plants
one-quarter of the time.

Mendel then crossed
dwarf pea plants with the
tall pea plants that bred
true. All the peas produced
grew into tall pea plants.
The characteristics of
dwarfness seemed to have
disappeared.

Next Mendel had each
of this new generation of
tall plants self-pollinate
and found that they pro-
duced peas that grew into
tall plants and dwarf plants
in a 3-to-1 ratio. Dwarfness
had been submerged in one
generation but had then
shown up in the next.

In other words, tallness
was dominant and dwarf-
ness recessive, so that
tallness overwhelmed
dwarfness—but only tem-
porarily.

Mendel found that
other types of traits in pea
plants worked the same
way. There was 1o mixing
of extremes.

Mendel also found that
male and female contrib-
uted equally. It was as
though each organism had
two factors for a particular
trait and each contributed
one of them to the off-
spring. If the factors were
different in the offspring,
and one was dominant, the
recessive characteristic
didn’t show but was still
there. [t might be the one
handed on to the next gen-
eration, and if the other par-
ent also handed on a
recessive, so that the off-
spring had two recessives
and no dominant, the reces-
sive trait would appear
again,

Mendel thus worked
out the Mendelian laws of in-
heritance, as they were later
to be called, and founded
the science of genetics (from
a Greek word meaning “to
give birth to"”). He pub-
lished his first paper on this
work in 1865 (a second fol-
lowed in 1869), but it was
totally ignored for thirty-
three years.

Since the Mendelian
laws showed that extremes
