in working out the mathe-
matical basis of the commu-
nication of information and
of the control of a system in
the light of such communi-
cation. By 1948 he had sum-
marized his work in a book
entitled Cybernetics. This
was the first important
book devoted to computer
control,

Nuclear
Structure

The chemical properties of
atoms depend on the ar-
rangement of their elec-
trons into shells. This is
what makes the periodic
table of the elements work
(see 1916).

The nuclear properties
of atoms must depend on
the arrangement of the pro-
tons and neutrons in the nu-
clei. They, too, might be
arranged in shells, but if so,
this would be more difficult
to determine than in the
case of the outer electrons.

The German-born
American physicist Maria
Goeppert-Mayer (1906â€”
1972) tried to work out the
nature of the nuclear shells
[rom the nuclear properties
that had been observed for
different atoms. She
showed that nuclei that
contained 2, 8, 20, 50, 82, or
126 protons or neutrons
would be more stable than

their neighbors in the peri-
odic table. These were
called shell numbers, or
more dramatically but less
scientifically, magic num-
bers. If 28 or 40 protons or
neutrons were present,
some stability resulted, and
these were called semi-
magic numbers.

Goeppert-Mayer ad-
vanced her notions in 1948,
at about the same time a
German physicist, Johan-
nes Hans Daniel Jensen
(1907-1973), advanced the
same views. As a result,
Goeppert-Mayer and Jen-
sen received shares of the
Nobel Prize for physics in
1963.

Quantum
Electrodynamics

Making use of quantum the-
ory, the American physicist
Richard Phillips Feynman
(1918-1988), in 1948,
worked out equations gov-
erning the behavior of elec-
trons and electromagnetic
interactions generally;
equations that allowed pre-
dictions of such phenomena
to be made with far greater
precision than had been
possible until then.

This theory was called
quantum electrodynamics,
and it proved so successful
that it has been used as a
model for the attempted
working out of equations

governing the behavior of
particles subjected to the

weak and strong interac-

tions.

For this work, Feyn-
man received a share of the
Nobel Prize for physics in
1965.

The Big Bang

LeMaitre had advanced the
idea that the Universe origi-
nated as a condensed cos-
mic egg, which exploded
and set its expansion into
motion (see 1927).

In 1948 Gamow (see
1929) considered the conse-
quences of this explosion
(which he called the big
bang) in far greater detail.
He was the first to attempt
to work out how the chemi-
cal elements were formed
in the aftermath of the ex-
plosion.

He also predicted that
the big bang had resulted
in a vast surge of energy,
and that the Universe had
cooled off as it expanded
until it was now, on the av-
erage, just a few degrees
above absolute zero. As a re-
sult, there should be a back-
ground of microwave
radiation coming equally
from all parts of the sky,
with a wavelength suitable
to a universe at such a tem-
perature.
