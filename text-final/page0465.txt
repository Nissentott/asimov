Electron as
Subatomic
Particle

By now Perrin’s work had
convinced everyone that
cathode rays consisted of
negatively charged parti-
cles (see 1895). The last bit

of evidence was supplied by

the British physicist Joseph
John Thomson (1856—
1940), who showed that
cathode rays could be de-
flected not only by a mag-
net but by an electric field.
From the amount of
the deflection, Thomson
could work out the ratio of
the electric charge of the

cathode ray particle to its
mass. This ratio turned out
to be quite high, so that ei-
ther the charge was high or
the mass was low or both.
Thomson supposed that the
charge would be the unit
charge worked out from
Faraday’s laws of electroly-
sis (see 1832). If so, the
mass of the cathode ray par-
ticle would be only a small
fraction of the hydrogen
atom'’s, the smallest atom
known. (We now know that
the particle has a mass only
Y837 of hydrogen’s.)
Thomson called the
particle the electron,
ing use of Stoney's sug-
gested name for the

 
 

fundamental unit of elec-
tric charge (see 1891), since
he suspected that the parti-
cle carried that fundamen-
tal unit, And to be sure, no
smaller electric charge has
actually been observed
since then.

The electron was the
first subatomic particle (par-
ticle smaller than an atom)
