some months of 30 days
and some of 31, plus an
added day every four years
(Leap Year). The additional
day was added because the
year is actually 365"% days
long, and in this respect the
Julian calendar was an im-
provement over the Egyp-
tian. (The Julian calendar,
with a small correction
made sixteen centuries
later, is still in use today.)
