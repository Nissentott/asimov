Chemical
Elements

It had been just about two
thousand years now since
Aristotle listed the four ele-
ments (earth, water, air,
and fire) that made up the
Earth and a fifth (aether)
that made up the heavenly
bodies. That still remained
the dominant theory, al-
though some alchemists
had considered mercury,
sulfur, and salt to be partic-
ularly important.

But the day of alchemy
was over. The Irish-born
physicist and chemist Rob-
ert Boyle (1627-1691) pub-
lished a book in 1661 that
was called The Skeptical
Chymist, and as a result,
the very name alchemist
was changed to chemist.
The dropping of the prefix
al-, which is the Arabic rhe,
seemed somehow to sym-
bolize turning the back on
medievalism. In this book,
Boyle also divorced chemis-
try from medicine and
made it a separate science.

Boyle’s most important
feat was to push chemistry
in the direction of becom-
ing an experimental sci-
ence. He wanted chemical
elements to be established
by experimentation rather
than by deduction.

He pointed out that an
element was one of the sim-
ple components of the
Earth, one that could not
be converted into anything
simpler. Therefore, any-
thing that couldn’t be con-
verted into anything
simpler was an element,
while anything that could
be so converted was not.
The only way you could dif-
ferentiate an element from
a nonelement, then, was to
try hard to make a sub-
stance simpler.

Acid-Base
Balance

Hippocrates (see 420 B.c.)
had maintained that health
was preserved by the
proper balance of the four
humors (blood, phlegm,

bile, and black bile), and
this idea had also lasted

two thousand years, like

the four elements of Aris-
totle.

The Dutch physician
Franz Deleboe (1614-1672),
better known by the Latin-
ized name Franciscus Syl-
vius, denounced the four-
humor theory in 1661 and
suggested instead that
health depended on the bal-
ance of acids and bases in
the body. This was cer-
tainly an improvement on
the older view.

Sylvius also studied di-
gestive juices such as saliva
and suggested that diges-
tion was a chemical process
(fermentation) rather than
a mechanical one (grind-
ing). In this, he was quite
right.
