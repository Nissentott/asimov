Saturnian
System

The probe Voyager I passed
by Saturn on November 12,
1980. Voyager 2 followed
not long after. A number of
the satellites of Saturn
were for the first time seen
as more than points of
light.

Titan, the largest satel-
lite, was known to have an
atmosphere of methane,
but methane turned out to
be present in small quanti-
ties compared to nitrogen.
(Nitrogen is a gas difficult
to detect from Earth be-
cause its absorption charac-
teristics are not easy to
observe and study.) The Ti-
tanian atmosphere turned
out to be 98 percent nitro-
gen and 2 percent methane
and may be thicker than
Earthâ€™s atmosphere. The at-
mospheric haze prevented
any view of the surface,
where there might be nitro-
gen lakes with dissolved
polymers of methane and (a
few speculate) possibly
some form of life.

The other Saturnian

satellites were, as might be
expected, cratered. Mimas,
the innermost of the nine
sizable satellites, has a cra-
ter so large that the impact
that produced it must have
nearly shattered it.

Enceladus, the second
of the nine, is compara-
tively smooth, while Hyper-
ion is the least spherical
and has a diameter that var-
ies from 90 to 120 miles. Ia-
petus is a two-toned
satellite, with one hemi-
sphere much darker than
the other, as though one
side were icy and the other
coated with dark dust. The
reason for this is not yet
clear.

The Saturn probes suc-
ceeded in finding eight sat-
ellites that were too small
to be seen from Earth,
bringing the total number
to seventeen. Of the new
satellites, five are closer to
Saturn than Mimas is. Two
satellites that are just in-
side Mimas's orbit are un-
usual in being co-orbital.
That is, they share the
same orbit, chasing each
other around Saturn end-
lessly. This was the first

 

known example of such co-
orbital satellites. .

The three new satel-
lites beyond Mimas also
represent unprecedented
situations. The long-known
satellite Dione was found to
have a tiny co-orbital com-
panion, Dione B, which cir-
cles Saturn at a point 60
degrees ahead of Dione. As
a result, Saturn, Dione, and
Dione B are always at the
apices of an equilateral tri-
angle. This is a compara-
tively stable gravitational
position, called a Trojan sit-
uation because it is also the
position of the Sun, Jupiter,
and the Trojan asteroids
(see 1906).

The satellite Tethys has
two tiny companions, one
60 degrees ahead of it in
orbit and one 60 degrees be-
hind it. Clearly, the Satur-
nian satellite system is the
richest and most complex
in the Solar System.

The Saturnian rings
were also found to be far
more complex than had
been thought. From a close
view, they consist of hun-
dreds, perhaps even thou-
sands, of thin ringlets,
