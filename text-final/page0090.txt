was found near the Asia
Minor city of Magnesia, it
came to be called the Mag-
nesian stone, or in English,
a magnet, and the phenome-
non was magnetism. The
phenomenon was first stud-
ied by Thales (see 585 B.c.).
It was eventually found
that stroking with the mag-
netic ore could turn a sliver
of iron or steel into a mag-
net.

Somehow it was dis-
covered that if a magnetic
sliver was allowed to turn
freely, it would come to rest
pointing in a north-south
direction. We don't know
how this fact was discov-
ered, but the Chinese were
the first to be aware of it. It
is referred to in Chinese
books dating as far back as
the second century.

The Chinese never used
the magnet for direction-
finding in navigation, be-
cause by and large they
were not great navigators,
The Arabs may have
learned of it from them,
however, and perhaps some
Crusaders learned of it
from the Arabs.

In 1180 the English
scholar Alexander Neckam
(1157-1217) was the first
European to make refer-
ence to this directional abil-
ity of magnetism. As soon
as the Europeans heard of
it, they began to try to put
it to use as a navigation
aid, and they began to im-
prove it. Eventually a mag-
netic needle was put on a
card marked with various
directions, and because the
needle was free to move all

around the card, it was re-
ferred to as a magnetic com-
pass (from a French word
meaning “to go around”’).
If a single point in time
can be picked as the mo-
ment when Europe first
took the road that was to
lead to world dominion, it
was the moment when Eu-
ropeans heard of the mag-
netic compass and put it to
use. With the compass, Eu-
ropeans could eventually
go wherever they wished
over the wide oceans, so
that they eventually domi-
nated the whole world as
no other relatively small
group of people had ever
done before or (in all likeli-
hood) will ever do again.

Spitzbergen

Icelandic Vikings appar-
ently discovered islands
they called Svalbard (cold
coast), which are perhaps
better known to non-Scan-

dinavians as Spitzbergen
(mountain peaks). These
are 900 miles north of Ice-
land and 500 miles north of
the northern tip of Norway.
They represent the far-
thest point north reached

by the Viking explorers, or
by any ships without com-
passes. The discovery, like
all Viking discoveries, re-
mained unknown to Europe
generally.
