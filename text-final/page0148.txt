Kepler tried to work out an
orbit that would best fit the
data Tycho had gathered.

Kepler tried a number
of things that didn’t work
and was finally driven to
the all-but-unthinkable al-
ternative of considering or-
bits that were not circles
Finally, he had his answer
and, in 1609, published
it in a book entitled
Astrononiia Nova (New As-
tronomy). In it, he main-
tained that planets moved
about the Sun in ellipses
(flattened circles whose geo-
metric properties had first
been explained by the
Greek mathematician Apol-
lonius in the first century
B.C.). The Sun was located
at one of the two foci of the
ellipse, and with such or-
bits, no curve combinations
were required. Our present
picture of the Solar System
(that is, the Sun plus its ret-
inue of planets and other
bodies) remains essentially
that worked out by Kepler
No substantial change is ex-
pected in the future.

The elliptical orbit is
Kepler’s First Law of plane-
tary motion. He also ad-
vanced a Second Law in his

 

book, which described how
the planetary speed altered
with distance from the Sun.
With the Sun at one focus
of an ellipse, the planet was
closer to the Sun (and
moved faster) in one half of
the orbit than in the other.

The Milky Way

The Milky Way is a dim
band of foggy light that en-
circles the sky. Many were
the speculations as to what
it was. It might be a spurt
of milk from a goddess’s
breast, or it might be a
bridge used by the gods to
travel from Earth to
Heaven or vice versa. De-
mocritus (see 440 B.C.) sug-
“t’\[Ld that the Milky Way
a conglomeration of
vast numbers of stars that
were individually too dim
to be seen. That, however,

 

 

 

was just a speculation.

In 1609, however, Gali-
leo heard rumors of the con-
struction of a telescope in
the Netherlands the year
before. From what he
heard, he had little trouble
devising a telescope for
himself, and for the first

time, he turned one on the
sky.

When he looked at the
Milky Way through the tele-
scope, he found that it was
indeed composed of a myr-
iad of faint stars. Democri-
tus had been absolutely
correct.

In fact, wherever Gali-
leo looked he saw addi-
tional stars that, without
the telescope, were too dim
to be seen. The sky was full
of them.

Moon

Galileo also looked at the
Moon through his tele-
scope. He found that it con-
tained craters, mountains,
and dark areas that he
thought might be seas.
These dark areas are still
called maria, which is the
Latin word for “seas.” It
was quite obvious that the
Moon was not a heavenly
globe of light, but was a
world that in some ways re-
sembled Earth. Aristotle’s
notion that heavenly bodies
were of a structure differ-
ent from that of Earth thus
received a blow.
