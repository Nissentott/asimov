know what it might be, so
he simply called it a filtra-
ble virus (virus is the Latin
word for “poison”).

It turned out that a con-
siderable number of human
diseases were caused by vi-
ruses, including the com-
mon cold, influenza,
chickenpox, mumps, and
poliomyelitis. Such dis-
eases were not as easily
handled as those caused by
larger organisms such as
bacteria and protozoa.

Mitochondria

As microscopes improved,
it was clear that the cell

did not consist of a homoge-
neous fluid but had a com-
plex structure, even outside
the nucleus. In 1898 the
German histologist Carl
Benda (1857-1933) made
out tiny bodies in the cyto-
plasm. He called them mito-
chondria, from Greek words
meaning ‘'threads of carti-
lage,” which is what he
thought they were. They
turned out to be far more
than that.

Epinephrine

What we now call the adre-
nal glands (from Latin

words meaning “‘at the kid-
ney”’) are small lumps of tis-
sue above each kidney.

They first came into promi-
nence in 1855, when a Brit-

ish physician, Thomas
Addison (1793-1860),
showed that the deteriora-
tion of the adrenal glands
gave rise to a serious condi-
tion (known as Addison’s
disease to this day).

In 1894 a British physi-
ologist, Edward Albert
Sharpey-Schafer (1850—
1935), showed that a sub-
stance extracted from the
adrenals would raise the
blood pressure if injected
into an animal’s blood-
stream.

An American pharma-
cologist, John Jacob Abel
(1857-1938), was able to
study this substance in
1898, and he named it epi-
nephrine (from Greek words
meaning “above the kid-
ney”’). Three years later, a
Japanese chemist, Jokichi
Takamine (1854-1922),
working in the United
States, isolated the sub-
stance in pure, crystalline
form. He called it adrena-
line. Both names are still
used.

Actually epinephrine/
adrenaline was the first hor-
mone to be isolated, but the
hormone concept had not
yet been elaborated.

Submarine

Ships made to go under the
water have been a human
fancy for centuries, but the
first to attempt to build one
was a Dutch inventor, Cor-

nelis Jacobszoon Drebbel
(1572-1633), who piloted
one in the Thames River be-
tween 1620 and 1624. An
American inventor, David
Bushnell (1742-1824), de-
vised simple submarines
that were used unsuccess-
fully against British ships
in harbor during the Revo-
lutionary War and the War
of 1812,

It was not till 1898,
however, that an American
mechanical engineer,
Simon Lake (1866—1945),
succeeded in devising a sub-
marine that could actually
go out to sea. In that year,
his submarine Argonaut I
sailed from Norfolk, Vir-
ginia, to New York. This
marked the true beginning
of modern submarines.
