nonconductors. Noncon-
ductors might also be

called insulators, from the
Latin word for “island,”
since a nonconductor could
pen up the electric fluid

Achromatic
Lens

. Newton had been con-
vinced that a lens was
bound to produce colors at
the focus that would blur
|  the image (see 1666). How-
| ever, an English mathema-
tician, Chester Moor Hall
(1703—1771), noticed some-
thing Newton had missed:
different kinds of glass pro-
duced spectra of different
widths. Flint glass (con-
taining lead) produced a
rather wider spectrum than
crown glass (ordinary win-
dow glass) did.

Hall therefore decided
to make a convex lens out
| of crown glass and a con-
cave lens out of flint glass,
designed in such a way that
the two would fit together
to form a single biconvex
lens. The crown glass
would spread out the col-

 

 

ors, while the flint glass
would bring them together
again without neutralizing
all the magnifying value of
the crown glass. The end re-
sult was an achromatic
(from Greek words mean-
ing “'no color”) lens, which
would magnify an object
without producing colors.

Hall did not publicize
his lens properly, and John
Dollond (1706—1761), who
prepared an achromatic
lens in 1757, often gets the
credit. In any case, the ach-
romatic lens made it possi-
ble to use the entire lens
and to have a short focal
length, so that telescopes
could be made shorter and
more convenient—and bet-
ter, too.

Blood Pressure

Hales (see 1705) had stud-
ied the flow of sap in plants
and went on to study the

flow of blood in animals,
measuring the rate of flow
in different portions of the
circulatory system. Most
important of all, he was the
first person to measure
blood pressure, albeit in a
crude way. He described
his work in this field in a
book entitled Hemostaticks,
published in 1733.

Two Electrical
Fluids

The French physicist
Charles-Francois de Cister-
nay du Fay (1698—1739)
was experimenting with
static electricity as so many
scientists were doing at this
time. In 1733 he found that
two bits of cork electrified
by the same means repelled
each other.

He found, however,
that if one cork ball was
electrified by means of an
