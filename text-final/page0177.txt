night to night as they
passed around the planet to
the other side and across
the face again. By watching
long enough and dividing
the time elapsed by the
number of turns, an accu-
rate measure of the rota-
tion rate of the planet could
be obtained.

In this way, in 1665,
the Italian-born French as-
tronomer Gian Domenico
Cassini (1625-1712) deter-
mined that Mars rotated in
24 hours 40 minutes, while
Jupiter rotated in 9 hours
56 minutes.

Since these planets ro-
tated on their axis as Earth

did, it made them seem
more like our ]"L’,Ikl As as
tronomical discoveries con-
tinued, Earth seemed less
and less a special case

 

cept insofar as we are here
on Earth and not anywhere
else.

 

 

Light Spectrum

The English scientist Isaac
Newton (1642—-1727), curi-
ous about light, conducted
a series of crucial experi-
ments in 1665 and 1666. He
allowed a beam of light to
pass through a prism (a tri-
angular piece of glass) and
then fall on a white wall.
What emerged was a
band of colors, the least
bent portion of the light
being red, and then follow-
ing, in order, orange, yel-
low, green, blue, and violet,

 

each merging gradually
into the next.

Were the colors pro-
duced by the glass? No, for
when Newton passed the
light that had emerged
from the prism through a
second prism oriented in
the opposite direction, all
he got was white light. The
colors had recombined.

This meant that light
had to be looked upon in a
totally new way. It had al-
ways been assumed that
white light was “pure”
light and that color was in-

troduced as an impurity
through the effect of mate-
rial substances on the light.

Newton’s work made it
clear that color was an in-
herent property of light and
that white light was a mix-
ture of different colors. Mat-
ter affected color only by
absorbing some kinds of
light and transmitting or re-
flecting others.

Exactly what it was

 

 

that made light assume dif-
ferent colors was not yet

clear, however.
