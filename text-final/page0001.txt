Science in Prehistory
(4,000,000 B.C.—3500 B.C.)

The earliest human techno-
logical advances—the fash-
ioning of stone tools and
the capture of fire—were
made long before Homo sa-
piens sapiens (modern man)
evolved. Curiosity and need
drove our hominid ances-
tors to learn about the natu-
ral world and to use it to
their advantage—for food,
for warmth, for protection.
As early as 2,000,000 B.c.,
Homo habilis not only used
tools but also made them—
sharp-edged flints em-
ployed as knives, scrapers,
and the tips of spears.
Around 500,000 B.c., Homo
erectus, who had improved
on the first stone imple-
ments and was able to hunt
mammoths and other large
animals, learned how to
use fire. With the control of
this potent natural force,
early humans gained much
more than a source of
warmth; they could now
keep predators away and
clear land, cook food, and
dry hides and wood. Hornto
erectus also built the first
crude homes. Modern man

stepped onto the evolution-
ary stage about 50,000 B.c.
By 20,000 B.c., people had
invented oil lamps and
were hunting with bows
and arrows. By about
10,000 B.c., as the glaciers
of the most recent ice age
receded, human habitation
had expanded to nearly all
parts of the globe. In 10,000
B.C., the Earth's population
was approximately 3 mil-
lion. As the practice of herd-
ing animals increased and
as agriculture improved,
the number of humans
grew to about 5 million by
8000 B.c. It is from this
point on, a period of about
10,000 years, that civiliza-
tion as we know it has de-
veloped. The domestication
of animals (12,000 B.c.)
meant that hungry humans
no longer had to follow mi-
grating herds; they could
now decide where they
would live. The cultivation
of wheat and barley (8000
B.C.) gave them a food sup-
ply beyond the available
local vegetation, while irri-
gation (5000 B.c.) expanded

the areas suitable for grow-
ing. Around 7000 B.c., the
invention of pottery gave
rise to a new form of cook-
ing; instead of just roast-
ing, now there was boiling
—and the stew was born.
Pottery was eventually
made by a wheel, a device
that may have suggested
the wheeled cart, first used
around 3500 B.c. At roughly
the same time, ploughs pro-
vided a better way to pre-
pare the ground for
growing, and river boats ex-
panded the means and ease
of transport. The earliest
form of writing had evolved
by 3500 B.c. This innova-
tion was of monumental im-
portance. In the short term,
writing meant that records
could be kept, and it facili-
tated commerce and com-
munication. More
important, it allowed learn-
ing and literature to be ac-
cumulated and passed
down from generation to
generation. With the inven-
tion of writing, the era of re-
corded history began.
