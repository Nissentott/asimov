the energy was just suffi-
cient to eject an electron.
The shorter the wavelength
beyond that, the more ener-
getic the ejected electron
would be and the more
speedily it would travel.
Since some metals may
hold electrons more firmly
than others, the critical
wavelength must be shorter
in some cases than in oth-
ers.

Einstein’s analysis had
several consequences.

1. It explained the pho-
teelectric effect completely.
There have not had to be
any extensions or additions
to the explanation since.

2. It made use of quan-
tum theory to explain a phe-
nomenon unexplainable
otherwise, and a phenome-
non moreover that had not
been in Planck’s mind
when he worked out the the-
ory. If quantum theory
were simply a mathemati-
cal device needed to make
black-body radiation come
out right, it wouldn't be
likely to be applicable with-
out modification to an alto-
gether different
phenomenon. Einstein's
work therefore established
quantum theory as legiti-
mate and not merely a
mathematical trick.

3. It showed that light
could be treated as parti-
cles in some respects. New-
ton's particles and
Huygens's waves (see 1678)
were thus combined into a

whole that was far more
complex and useful than
could have been imagined
on the basis of seventeenth-
century knowledge. The
particle aspects of light,
and of electromagnetic ra-
diation generally, are re-
ferred to nowadays as
photons.

It was for this work on
the photoelectric effect (not
on his still greater discover-
ies in connection with rela-
tivity) that Einstein gained
a Nobel Prize in physics in
15217

Brownian
Motion and
Atomic Size

Brownian motion had re-
mained somewhat of a puz-
zle since Brown had
discovered it (see 1827). In
1902 the Swedish chemist
Theodor Svedberg (1884—
1971) had suggested that
the unequal bombardment
of small particles by mole-
cules from all sides im-
pelled them to move
randomly, this way and
that.

Einstein, in 1905, ana-
lyzed the possibility of mo-
lecular bombardment
thoroughly. He reasoned
that any sizable object im-
mersed in water (or any
fluid) is bombarded from
all sides, and surely more
from one side at one mo-
ment and more from an-

other side at another
moment. However, the
countless trillions of mole-
cules involved means that
any small differences will
be so small as to be inde-
tectable.

If we consider a
smaller and smaller object,
the total number of mole-
cules striking it at a given
moment will be smaller,
and little deviations will
loom larger. By the time ob-
jects approach the micro-
scopic in size, an additional
molecule from this side or
that should be sufficient to
give it a noticeable push in
this direction or that.

Einstein worked out an
equation to describe
Brownian motion, one from
which it was possible to
work out the size of mole-
cules and of the atoms mak-
ing them up, provided one
found a way to measure cer-
tain other variables that
occur in the equation.

It was not long before
Einstein’s equation was put
to good use.

Color and
Stellar
Luminosity

We all know that some
stars are brighter than oth-
ers; astronomers measure
that brightness as magui-
tude. A star can appear
bright for either of two rea-
sons. It may radiate a large
