Adrenocorti-
cotrophic
Hormone

It was becoming more obvi-
ous that the pituitary gland
was a particularly im-
portant source of protein
hormones, some of which
activated and controlled
other glands, such as the
thyroid and the gonads.

In 1943, the Chinese-
born American biochemist
Choh Hao Li (b. 1913) iso-
lated, from the pituitary, a
hormone that stimulated
the adrenal cortex, using it
to produce and release the
cortical hormones (see
1935, Cortisone), This pitu-
itary hormone was named
adrenocorticotrophic hor-
mone, a name usually ab-
breviated ACTH. It had the
same effect on the body as
cortisone, though more in-
directly.

Lysergic Acid
Diethylamide

In 1913 a Swiss chemist, Al-
bert Hoffman (b. 1906), was
working with lysergic acid,
which is obtained from
ergot, a mold that produces
serious and sometimes
deadly disorders in the

human body. Hoffman
modified it to form the di-
ethyl amide of the com-
pound and apparently
absorbed some of the sub-
stance. He was overcome
by strange sensations, vivid
fantasies, and brilliant col-
ors. He deliberately swal-
lowed a tiny bit more of the
material—and the results
were even more weird.

He had clearly suffered
from hallucinations, so that
lysergic acid diethylamide
(usually abbreviated LSD)
came to be called a halluci-
nogen, or a psychedelic drug.
Other hallucinogens occur
in nature, in certain mush-
rooms, in peyote cactus,
and elsewhere. Even alco-
hol in sufficient quantities
becomes hallucinogenic.
Hallucinogens have been
widely used in religious cer-
emonies, presumably be-
cause they seem to offer a
vision of another world.

LSD was a particularly
effective hallucinogen, and
in time its use became a fad
among young people,
which helped fasten the
drug culture on America.

Seyfert Galaxies

Over twenty years had
passed since it had become
clear that there were innu-

merable galaxies lying deep
in space, but there didn’t
seem much hope of learn-
ing any significant details
about the inner structures
of objects that were mil-
lions of light-years distant.

In 1943, however, the
American astronomer Carl
K. Seyfert (1911-1960) de-
tected an odd galaxy with a
very bright spot at the cen-
ter. Other galaxies of the
sort have since been ob-
served, and the entire
group is known as Seyfert
galaxies. Altogether perhaps
1 percent of all galaxies are
Seyfert galaxies.

This was the first case
of what came to be called
active galaxies, those with
centers that seem to be the
site of activity beyond the
normal. Much more re-
mained to be discovered
about such galaxies when it
became possible to observe
them outside the range of
visible light.

Aqualungs

Until now, if you wanted to
spend a reasonable period
of time under water with
sufficient mobility to allow
exploration, you needed a
diving-suit, which was
heavy and required a life-
line.
