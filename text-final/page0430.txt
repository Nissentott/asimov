working with electric gener-
ators, however, to get a
kind of current that goes
first in one direction, then
in the other, alternating
very rapidly, with the cur-
rent intensity rising and
falling like a sine wave.
This is alternating current
(ac).

Alternating current
didn't seem as useful as di-
rect current, but then in
1883 a Croatian electrical
engineer, Nikola Tesla
(1856—1943), constructed
an induction motor that
could make use of alternat-
ing current to do useful
work.

Edison had committed
himself to direct current,
and he fought the use of al-
ternating current, but he
lost out eventually.

Edison Effect

Once Edison had invented
the electric light (see 1879),
he naturally endeavored to
improve it. In particular,
he wanted to make the fil-
ament last longer. In 1883
he sealed a metal wire into
a light bulb near the hot
filament. Perhaps he
thought this might absorb
some of the remaining air
in the tube and lessen its de-
structive effect on the fila-
ment.

To Edison's surprise,
electricity flowed from the
hot filament to the cold

 

wire across the gap that
separated them. This is
called the Edison effect.
Edison wrote up the ef-
fect meticulously and pat-
ented it, as a matter of
course, but he could think
of no use for it. This was his
only purely scientific dis-
covery, and he didn’t follow
it up. The Edison effect
proved the basis for the sci-
ence of electronics that was
eventually to come.

Rayon

The French chemist Louis-
Marie-Hilaire Bernigaud de
Chardonnet (1839-1924)
had begun some five years
earlier to produce fibers by
forcing solutions of nitrocel-
lulose through tiny holes
and allowing the solvent to
evaporate. He perfected the
process in 1883 and found
he had a fiber that strongly
resembled silk in its fine-
ness and shininess. He
called it rayon (from the
French word for “a ray of
light”") because of its shini-
ness. He used only partly ni-
trated cellulose, so rayon
wasn't explosive, but it was
still uncomfortably in-
flammable.

Rayon was the first
synthetic fiber, and it was
to be followed by many
others.

Meiosis

The discovery of the mecha-
nism of cell division by
Flemming (see 1882) stimu-
lated many biologists into
investigating the matter
further.

The Belgian cytologist
Edouard Joseph Louis-
Marie van Beneden (1846—
1910) found that the num-
ber of chromosomes in the
cells of a particular species
was always constant,
though the number varied
from species to species.

(It is now known that there
are forty-six chromosomes
in human cells.)

Furthermore, he dis-
covered that in the forma-
tion of the sex cells (that is,
the ova and spermatozoa),
the division of chromo-
somes during one of the cell
divisions was not preceded
by a doubling. Each egg
and sperm cell, therefore,
ended with only half the
usual number of chromo-
somes. (This halving of
number was called meiosis,
from a Greek word mean-
ing “to make smaller”).
Consequently, when a
sperm cell entered an egg
cell in the process of fertil-
ization, the chromosomes
reached their normal num-
ber for the species, half of
them coming from the
mother and half from the
father.
