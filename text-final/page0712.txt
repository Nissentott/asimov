 

 

(see 1968), this made it
seem ever more likely that
chemical changes took
place in nonliving systems,
where conditions were fa-
vorable, that would inevita-
bly lead in the direction of
life.

Gene Synthesis

Khorana, who had worked
on the genetic code (see
1961), headed a research
team that in 1970 suc-
ceeded in synthesizing a
genelike molecule from
scratch. That is, they did
not use an already existing
gene as a template but
began with nucleotides and
put them together in the
right order.

Further exemplifying
the strides made in the syn-
thesis of complicated mole-
cules, Li, who had
synthesized the enzyme ri-
bonuclease (see 1969), syn-
thesized the still more
complicated molecule
of growth hormone in
1970.

Recombinant
DNA

In 1970 the American mi-
crobiologists Hamilton
Othanel Smith (b. 1931)
and Daniel Nathans (b.
1928) discovered an en-
zyme that could cut a mole-
cule of DNA at certain

specific sites. The resulting
DNA fragments were still
large enough to contain ge-
netic information, and this
work led to the formation
of fragments that could re-
combine with each other to
form new genes that did
not exist in nature.

This technique of re-
combinant DNA became an
important tool for geneti-
cists and was a long step to-
ward genetic engineering, in
which genes could be modi-
fied, transferred, or de-
signed.

For this work, Nathans
and Smith shared the
Nobel Prize for physiology
and medicine in 1978.

Reverse
Transcriptase

Ever since Watson and
Crick had worked out the
structure of DNA and
shown how it could repli-
cate itself (see 1953), it had
been felt (and experimental
work had supported the
feeling) that genetic infor-
mation flowed in a one-way
fashion from DNA to RNA.
It usually turns out,
however, that nature is
more complicated than ex-
pected, and there are appar-
ently loops in the flow that
occasionally carry informa-
tion from RNA back to
DNA. In 1970 the American
oncologist Howard Martin

Temin (b. 1934), in his in-
vestigation of cancer cells,
located an enzyme he
called reverse transcriptase,
which could affect the
working of DNA in line
with information received
from RNA, thus making the
DNA more responsive to
the needs of the cell.

This same discovery
was made independently
by the American biochem-
ist David Baltimore (b.
1938). Temin and Balti-
more received shares of the
Nobel Prize for physiology
and medicine in 1975.

Megavitamin
Therapy

The necessity of vitamins in
the diet had been recog-
nized since the work of Eijk-
man (see 1896). The
dosages required appeared
to be small, howeverâ€”in
fact enzymatic in quantity.

Then it was suggested
that the tiny recommended
doses were merely those re-
quired to prevent the onset
of serious disease and that
much higher doses were
common in primitive
human diets that were
heavy on fruits and vegeta-
bles. It was these much
higher doses that might be
needed for full health, and
people began to speak of
megavitamin therapy.
