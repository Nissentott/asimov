were sure that human be-
ings had been alive for
much longer than the Bible
seemed to indicate. But
however long human be-
ings had been alive, had
they always been human
beings, or had they evolved
from some simpler form?

The bones from the Ne-
anderthal cave were clearly
human, but the skull was
rather different from those
of modern humans. It had
pronounced bony ridges
over the eyes, a backward-
sloping forehead, a reced-
ing chin, and unusually
prominent teeth.

The remains were
quickly dubbed Neanderthal
man and the question arose
as to whether it was a prim-
itive form of human being
or merely an individual
with some bone disorder.
The chief supporter of the
view that it was a primitive
form of humanity was a
French anthropologist,
Pierre-Paul Broca (1824—

1880), and he won out even-
tually.

Nowadays, we believe
Neanderthal man to be a
subspecies of Homo sapi-
ens. Nevertheless, the 1856
finding was the first step to-
ward the demonstration,
through fossil remains, of
the evolution of the human
species.

 

 

Pasteurization

In 1856 France's wine in-
dustry was in a bad way.
Wine often went sour as it
aged, and millions of francs
were lost. Pasteur (see
1846) undertook the task of
investigating the problem.
He studied samples of
wine under the microscope
and found that, when wine
aged properly, it contained
yeast cells that were spheri-
cal globules. Wine that was
souring contained elon-
gated yeast cells. He de-
cided there were two types

of yeast cells, one of which
created lactic acid

He also decided that
the only solution to the
problem was to kill the

yeast cells, good and bad

 

alike, after the alcohol had
formed but before the acid
had a chance to form. The
wine should be heated gen-
tly at about 50° C and then
stoppered and left to age
without the influence of
yeast.

The vintners were hor-
rified at the suggestion, but
they were desperate enough
to try it, and they found
that it worked. The process
of gentle heating was called
pasteurization, and it was
eventually applied to milk,
too, to prevent diseases
that might otherwise be
spread by its contamina-
tion.

This episode turned
Pasteur’s attention to the
world of microorganisms,
with enormously important
results.
