Kerosene

In 1853 a British physician,
Abraham Gesner (1797—-
1864), developed a process

ture of solid hydrocarbons,

for “wax."”

Kerosense proved ideal
for lamps, but even with
Gesner'’s process, enough
kerosene could not be pro-
duced to meet the great de-
mands represented by the
lamps of Europe and
America.

 

 

Cholera

In the early nineteenth cen-
tury, Europe suffered from
several cholera epidemics
that arrived from India,
where it was endemic. In-
creasingly, physicians were
sure that the contagion

arose from polluted water.
An English physician, John
Snow (1813—1858), had
published his views on this
matter in 1849.

When an epidemic of
cholera struck London in
1854, Snow studied the geo-
graphic incidence of chol-

era in relation to water

supply. He found five hun-

dred cases of cholera, for in-
stance, within a few blocks

of a public water pump

that drew water from a |
well just a few feet from a '
sewer pipe. He had the

pump handle removed, and
