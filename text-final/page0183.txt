Distance of
Mars

Nineteen centuries before,
Hipparchus had deter-
mined the distance to the
Moon (see 150 B.c.). Since
then, no further heavenly
distance had been deter-
mined accurately. The par-
allaxes of all other
heavenly bodies were far
too small to measure with
the unaided eye, and the
telescopes weren't quite
good enough to do the job.
However, Kepler's el-
liptical orbits and his three
laws of planetary motion
had made it possible to
build a model of the Solar
System in the proper pro-
portions. If any planetary
distance could be obtained,
then all the other distances
would be known too.
Cassini (see 1665) tack-

led the job. Thinking his
telescope might be good
enough if he viewed Mars
from two places sufficiently
far apart, he sent another
French astronomer, Jean
Richer (1630-1696), to Cay-
enne in French Guiana on
the northern shore of South
America.

In 1672 Cassini deter-
mined the position of Mars
against the stars as seen
from Paris and, using the
position of Mars as given in
reports from Cayenne,
worked out the parallax of
Mars. That gave him the
distance between Mars and
Earth at that time, and
from that he could calcu-
late the other distances of
the Solar System.

From his figures, he de-
termined that the Sun was
87,000,000 miles from the
Earth, as compared with
the 5,000,000-mile distance

that Aristarchus (see 280
B.C.) had estimated. Cas-
sini's estimate was 7 per-
cent too low, but for a first
try it was amazingly close.

For the first time, an
appropriate idea of the size
of the Solar System was ob-
tained. Even allowing for
the slightly low figure Cas-
sini had, it was clear that
the orbit of Saturn, which
was then the farthest
known planet, had to be
over 1,600,000,000 miles
across.

The stars must be far-
ther still. No one yet knew
how much farther the stars
must be, but Cassini gave
human beings the first
shocking realization of how
small they and their world
were compared to the Uni-
verse. There were other and
greater shocks yet to come.
