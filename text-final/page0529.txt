Sommerfeld (1868—1951)
felt the answer lay in the
fact that electron orbits
were more
than Bohr had suggested.
Bohr had made use of per-
tectly circular orbits, but
the orbits (like planetar
bits) might also be ellip-
tical. Sommerfeld used
Einstein’s theory of relati
ity to calculate the ellip-
tical orbits and quantum
theory to show that onl
certain kinds of ellipses
were possible. The combi-

ation of circular and elliy
tical orbits explained s
