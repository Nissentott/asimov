1765

 

Plutonism

The French geologist Nico-
las Desmarest (see 1756)
was interested in the
changes taking place on the
face of the Earth. He was
the first to maintain that
valleys had been formed by
the streams that ran
through them.

In 1765 he carried for-

ward the ideas of Guettard
(see 1752). Not only did he
maintain that heat was the
source of change, but he
saw it as having been ap-
plied through volcanic ac-
tion. He maintained that
basalt was a rock of volca-
nic origin and that large
sections of France’s rocks
consisted of ancient lava
flows. He was a Plutonist, in

other words (from the
Greek god Pluto who was
lord of the underworld).
However, most geologists
remained under the spell of
a German geologist, Abra-
ham Gottlob Werner
(1750-1817), who was a
Neptunist (see 1752) and in-
sisted that water was the
source of all change in the
Earth's surface.

 

1766

 

Hydrogen

Black’s work with carbon
dioxide (see 1754) had led
to great interest in gases on
the part of chemists. In
1766 the British chemist
Henry Cavendish (1731-
1810) found that some met-
als, when acted on by acid,
liberated a gas that was
highly inflammable and

which he therefore called
fire air. (We now call the
gas hydrogen.)

Actually, early experi-
menters, notably Boyle (see
1661), had obtained the
gas, but Cavendish was the
first to study it carefully
and report on its proper-
ties, so he is usually given
the credit for having discov-
ered it.

Cavendish measured
the weight of particular vol-
umes of different gases in
order to determine their
densities. He found this
new gas to be only one-four-
teenth the density of air,
and no substance under or-
dinary conditions has ever
been found to be less dense.
