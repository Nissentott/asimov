in the planets.

The Weizsacker mecha-
nism, with minor modifica-
tions, is now viewed as a
likely explanation of the for-
mation of the Solar Sys-
tem.

Radio Waves
from Hydrogen

In German-occupied Eu-
rope, scientific work could
proceed only with extreme
difficulty. The Dutch as-
tronomer Hendrik Christof-
fel van de Hulst (b. 1918)
was forced to do what work
he could with theoretical
notions that required no
more in the way of instru-
mentation than pen and
paper.

He considered the be-
havior of cold hydrogen
atoms and worked out how
the magnetic fields associ-
ated with the proton and
the electron in the hydro-
gen atom were oriented to
each other. They could line
up in the same direction or
in opposite directions.
Every once in a while a
particular atom could flip
from one configuration to
another, and in so do-
ing, it would emit a
radio wave 21 centi-
meters in length.

Any single hydrogen
atom ought to do this only

 

once in eleven million years
or so on the average, but
there were so many such
atoms in space that a con-
tinuing drizzle of 21-centi-
meter radiation should be
emitted, a drizzle that
might be intense enough to
be detectable.

Jansky's discovery had
shown that radio waves
were emitted by objects in
the sky (see 1932), but be-
vond Reber's simple radio
telescope (see 1937) there
was nothing with which to
observe such radio waves
in any detail. Van de
Hulst's calculations had to
wait for corroboration.

Americium and
Curium

After Seaborg had helped
McMillan isolate pluto-
nium (see 1940), it was
clear that other elements
might exist beyond that ele-
ment. Seaborg devoted
himself to the task of
preparing such elements
by bombarding the mas-
sive atoms already
known with subatomic
particles.

In 1944, by bombard-
ing plutonium with neu-
trons and alpha particles,
Seaborg and his associates
prepared americium, with
an atomic number of 95,
and curivm, with an atomic
number of 96. The former

was named for America
and the latter for the Curies
(see 1897).

V-2

Since Goddard flew the
first liquid-fueled rocket
(see 1926), his work had
been taken most seriously
in Germany, where a group
of 870 enthusiasts, includ-
ing Wernher von Braun (see
1942), had begun experi-
menting with rockets in
1930.

Hitler favored such
work for military use, and
in 1936 von Braun headed a
research project for the pur-
pose of developing military
rockets. In 1942 the first
true missile, carrying its
own fuel and oxygen, was
shot off and reached a
height of 60 miles.

On September 7, 1944,
such missiles, called V-2s,
with the V standing for
vergeltung (vengeance),
were first fired at London.
(The V-1 had been a pi-
lotless airplane wired
with explosives, not nearly
as damaging as the
V-2.)

In all, 4,300 V-2s were
fired; 1,230 hit London. Cas-
ualties included 2,511 dead
and 5,869 seriously
wounded. These missiles
were armed with only
chemical explosives, how-
ever, and came too late in
the war to save Germany.
