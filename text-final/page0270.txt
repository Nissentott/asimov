Insane Asylums

In ancient times, people
who were insane were
thought to be touched by
some sort of divine influ-
ence and were treated, on
occasion, with awe and re-
spect. However, in Chris-
tian Europe (influenced by
tales of demonic possession
in the New Testament),
they were thought to be in-
fested by devils and were
sometimes mistreated phys-
ically in order to force
those devils to leave. The in-
sane were also treated as
figures of fun, and insane
asylums were thought to be
amusing places to visit,
though they were dreadful
nightmares of howling, de-
mented people, imprisoned
and often subjected to the
most brutal treatment.

A French physician,
Philippe Pinel (1745-1826),
thought that psychotics
were sick in mind and de-
served as considerate treat-
ment as those who were
sick in body. In 1791 he
published his views on men-
tal alienation; that is, on

 

 

minds alienated from their
proper function. (For a
while, physicians who spe-
cialized in mental disorders
were called alienists, be-
cause of this.)

The French Revolution-
aries, always ready to
break with established cus-
tom, put Pinel in charge of
an insane asylum in 1793,
and there he struck off the
chains of the inmates and
began to make systematic
studies of their conditions.
He was the first to keep
well-documented case his-
tories of mental ailments.

It took half a century,
though, for this civilized
view of mental illness to
penetrate the rest of Eu-
rope (and the United
States).

 

 

Across North
America

A British-born Canadian ex-
plorer, Alexander Macken-
zie (1764—1820), worked his
way into the interior of Can-
ada, settling in what is now
the Province of Alberta.

From there he followed
what is now called the Mac-
kenzie River to its mouth in
the Arctic Ocean, which he
reached in 1789. In 1793 he
crossed the Rocky Moun-
tains to the Pacific Ocean in
what is now British Colum-
bia.

He was the first person
to visit the Atlantic, Pacific,
and Arctic shores—all
three—of North America.

Vancouver
Island

The British navigator
George Vancouver (1757—
1798), who had sailed with
Captain Cook (see 1768),
continued to explore the
lands Cook had examined—
Australia, New Zealand, Ta-
hiti, and Hawaii.

He also explored the
Pacific Northwest coast of
the United States and, in
1793, circumnavigated an
island of moderate size off
the coast of what is now
British Columbia. It is
called Vancouver Island in
his honor.
