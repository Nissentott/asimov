Gastric Acidity

Vitalism—the idea that the
properties of life are funda-
mentally different from
those of nonlife, in some re-
spects at least—seemed to
have a thousand lives as it
retreated from one bastion
to another. Surely there
had to be an important dif-
ference between the gentle
chemicals that made up
flesh and blood and the
harsh ones that made up
the inanimate world?
Among the harsh chem-
icals of the inanimate
world are the strong acids.
In 1823, however, Prout
(see 1815) discovered that
stomach secretions con-
tained hydrochloric acid,
one of those strong acids.
Hydrochloric acid was
thus part of the animate as
well as the inanimate
world. But why did it not
scarify and destroy the
stomach lining? Sometimes
it does, for it can cause ul-

cers, but usually it does
not, and even today we are
not quite sure why.

Platinum as
Catalyst

As early as 1816, Davy (see
1800) had noticed that cer-
tain inflammable gases
seemed to ignite and burn
more readily in the pres-
ence of platinum than in its

 

absence.

In 1823 the German
chemist Johann Wolfgang
Dobereiner (1780—-1849)
found that the effect was
heightened when he used
powdered platinum. In fact
hydrogen would ignite and
burn in air without having
to be heated if powdered
platinum was present. Nor
was the platinum con-
sumed in the process. It
was a catalyst.

Débereiner went on to
devise an automatic lighter
in which a jet of hydrogen

could be played upon pow-
dered platinum, causing
the hydrogen to flame at
once. This could be used to
light a cigar, for instance.

It wasn't practical, to
be sure. The platinum was
very expensive, and al-
though it wasn't consumed,
it was quickly poisoned by
impurities in the hydrogen
or in the air and then
wouldn't work until it was
cleaned up again.

In time, however, it
was discovered that plati-
num (and also other,
cheaper metals) would cata-
lyze many reactions involv-
ing hydrogen, and such
metal-catalyzed reactions
became very important in
industry.

Isomers

With the coming of the
atomic view of matter,
chemists routinely tried to
find out the atomic compo-
sition of the molecules of
