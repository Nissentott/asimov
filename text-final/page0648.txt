Diameter

Pluto had been discovered
by considering the unex-
plained perturbation of Ur-
anus’s orbit, assuming that
the gravitational pull of an
undiscovered planet caused
it, and calculating the place
where that planet must be
(see 1930). (Neptune had
also been discovered in this
way—see 1846—but its
presence had not corrected
all of the perturbation of
Uranus, just most of it.)

For Pluto to have
caused the perturbation, it
would have to be several
times as massive as Earth,
and at first this was as-
sumed to be the case, but it
turned out to be consider-
ably dimmer than would be
expected of a massive
planet, and that caused con-
siderable consternation.

In 1950 Kuiper, the dis-
coverer of Miranda (see
1948) and Nereid (see
1949), managed to see Pluto
as a disk and to measure its
apparent width. He showed
that its diameter could not
be more than 3,600 miles,
which made it smaller than
Mars and explained its dim-
ness. If Pluto was as small
as this, it could not be the
source of the perturbation
of Uranus, and it must
have been located in the
right spot by sheer coinci-
dence.

 

This would seem to in-
dicate that a planet mas-
sive enough to account for
the perturbations of Uranus
must still exist beyond Nep-
tune’s orbit, but if so, it has
not yet been located.

Turing Machine

The excitement over com-
puters after World War II
roused the interest of an En-
glish mathematician, Alan
Mathison Turing (1912—
1954). (Turing had been in-
strumental in breaking the
German secret code-ma-
chine during World War II,
which had made it possible
to anticipate German
moves and thus been of
major importance in help-
ing to defeat the Nazis.)

In 1950 Turing showed
that, in principle, a very
simple machine capable of
an astonishingly few moves
could solve any problem ca-
pable of being formulated
in mathematical terms.
This Turing machine went a
long way toward convinc-
ing workers in the field that
something one might call
artificial intelligence could
exist.

Turing also pointed out
how one could decide
whether artificial intelli-
gence had been achieved: if
one could carry on a conver-
sation with some hidden en-
tity without being able to
demonstrate from the con-
versation alone whether

that entity was a human
being or not, and if that en-
tity was a machine, it dis-
played artificial
intelligence.

Game-Playing
Computers

It was natural to think of
computers at first simply as
very fast calculating ma-
chines, different from Pas-
cal’s first adding device (see
1642) in degree but not in
kind.

However, it quickly be-
came apparent that com-
puters could solve
problems that human be-
ings considered to require
human thought. Thus in
1947 the American engineer
Arthur L. Samuel (b. 1901)
had worked out a checker-
playing computer, refine-
ments of which eventually
proved capable of playing
championship checkers.

Checkers, however, is a
comparatively simple
game. In 1950 the Ameri-
can mathematician Claude
Elwood Shannon (b. 1916)
suggested ways to design a
chess-playing computer,
and such machines have
since been built and play
excellent games of chess. In-
deed, it is not beyond the
limits of probability that
such a machine might be-
come the world’s chess
champion.
