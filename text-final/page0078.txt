Porcelain

About 700, the Chinese
learned to make porcelain,
a kind of pottery that was
shiny, almost glassy, very
hard, and very white.

What's more, it rang like a
bell when struck. Porcelain
eventually reached Europe,
where it was known as
china and where it became
the material of choice for
dishes (when it could be af-

forded), replacing wood, or-
dinary pottery, and metal.

About this time, other
products of the Orient were
making their way toward
Europe—notably cotton
and sugar from India.

Acetic Acid

Once the Arabs had con-
quered the territories of the
old Greek Hellenistic king-
doms, they were exposed to
the old Greek books on sci-
ence, and they loved them.
Whereas Greek learning
had been almost forgotten
in western Europe, the
Arabs preserved it and
translated the great books
of Euclid, Aristotle, Ptol-
emy, and others into Ara-
bic. For several centuries
the Arabs were the leading
scientists of the Western

world, excelling in astron-
omy, medicine, and al-
chemy.

The greatest of the Ara-
bian alchemists was Jabir
ibn Hayyan (ca. 721—ca.
815), known to Europeans
later as Geber. He sought
for methods of forming
gold, and also for some mys-
terious dry powder (elixir,
from Arabic words mean-
ing “‘the dry one") that
would do the job. It was
thought that such a magi-
cal substance could also
cure all disease, and it was
known as the elixir of life or

 
 

the panacea (from Greek
words meaning “all-heal-
ing""). Centuries of effort
went into a useless search
for this substance.

Geber, however, in his
researches, also managed
to make important discov-
eries. Up to his time, the
strongest acid known was
vinegar, a dilute solution of
acetic acid. By distilling
vinegar, Geber obtained
purer samples of acetic
acid, which were, natu-
rally, stronger than vine-
gar. This was important,
for until then the one agent
