could endure higher pres-
sures.

He prepared liquid car-
bon dioxide in considerable
quantity and then allowed
it to escape from the tube
through a narrow nozzle.
As it escaped, it evapo-
rated, and the temperature
of the liquid in the cylinder
dropped to the point where
it froze. For the first time,
solid carbon dioxide was
formed.

Solid carbon dioxide,
exposed to ordinary pres-
sures, will slowly sublime—
that is, evaporate directly
to gas without melting.
The sublimation point is
—78.57C,

Solid carbon dioxide
looks like ice, but since it
doesn'’t form a liquid, it is
popularly known as dry ice.
Dry ice is obviously a more
efficient cooling agent than
ordinary ice would be. Thi-
lorier added bits of dry ice
to diethyl ether (the well-
known ether that was soon
to be used as an anesthetic
and that remains liquid to
a very low temperature).
By allowing the mixture to
evaporate, he reached tem-
peratures as low as —110°
C. For the first time, a tem-
perature was reached in the
laboratory that was lower
than any temperature ever
recorded on Earth's sur-
face, even in the depths of
an Antarctic winter.

Coriolis Effect

The existence of cyclonic
storms, pointed out four
years earlier by Redfield
(see 1831) did not long re-
main a mystery

In 1835 a French physi-
cist, Gaspard-Gustave de
Coriolis (1792—1843), took
up the matter of motion on
a spinning surface, both
mathematically and experi-
mentally. When the Earth
spins, it spins all in a piece,
so that a point on the Equa-
tor, forced to move a length
of 25,000 miles in twenty-
four hours, must move a lit-
tle over 1,000 miles an
hour. As one progresses far-

ther and farther from the
Equator, either north or
south, a point on the sur-
face makes smaller and
smaller circles in the
course of the day and

  

moves more and more
slowly. At the poles, there
is no motion.

If, then, we imagine a
quantity of air or water
near the Equator, we can
see that it must be carried
west to east at just over
1,000 miles per hour. If that
air or water moves north
(or south) away from the
Equator, it retains its
speed, but the solid ground
beneath it moves more
slowly. The air or water
