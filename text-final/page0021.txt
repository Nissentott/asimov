 

Empire spread so did the
extent of learning. When
the empire collapsed to-

3500 B.C.

ward the end of the fifth
century A.p., scientific in-
quiry came to an end in

Europe. The Dark Ages
had begun.

 

Wheeled Carts

Where objects are too
heavy to be carried by
hand, transportation over
land becomes a problem.
Even where land is fairly
smooth, there is consider-
able friction, whether the
ground is sandy, pebbly, or
grassy.

Heavy objects had to
be dragged on sledges by
sheer force at first, and
even when animals
stronger than humans were
used (oxen, for instance), it
was slow going.

It could be made easier
if crude rollers in the form
of woaden logs were placed
under sledges. The rollers
turned rather than
dragged, and that cut down
on friction considerably. It
meant less work, but might
actually take more time, as
rollers had to be picked up
from the back and put
down again in front. What
is needed is an axle and
wheels.

We don't know how
someone came to think of
attaching two rollers to the
sledge back and front in
such a way that they rolled

inside the straps that held
them and remained with
the sledge at all times. At
the end of each roller, solid
wooden wheels were then
placed to lift the sledge off
the ground, and the wheels
turned freely.

A wheeled cart moves
more quickly and with far
less effort than a sledge,
even a sledge on rollers, so
that such carts marked a
revolution in land transpor-
tation. They made trade
easier, for one thing.

Such carts had showed
up in Sumeria by 3500 B.c.

River Boats

1t is certainly easier to
carry heavy loads over
water than over land.
Water offers much less fric-
tion than land does, and
there are no permanent un-
evennesses in it: no rocks,
no ridges, no uphill
stretches.

In this connection, the
Nile was ideal. Not only
was it a source of water for
rainless Egypt—not only
did its annual flood periodi-
cally fertilize the soil—but
its current was gentle and

there were no storms. The
Nile did not damage and
overturn boats as the un-
ruly Tigris in Sumeria did.
(The very name of that
river is the Greek word for
“tiger."")

What's more, the Nile
flows almost due north,
while the wind is almost
always from the north.
Therefore a boat can move
smoothly down river and,
when the time comes to re-
turn, a sail can be hoisted
to catch the wind and
the ship will be blown
upstream.

Egypt is not a forest na-
tion, but it had luxuriani
stands of reeds (called papy-
rus) along the river in those
days, and the reeds could
be used in bundles to build
boats. The boats were built
to form hollows, so that
they would displace more
water and carry more
weight without sinking.
These reed boats were not
particularly sturdy, but the
gentle Nile did not require
sturdy boats. (When Moses
was set afloat in the Nile
River, he was placed in a
little boat—or ark—of
bulrushes; that is, papyrus.)
