silicon, and called them
eka-boron, eka-aluminum,
and eka-silicon. (Eka is
“one" in Sanskrit, so that
each element is one below
the indicated element in
the periodic table.)

Mendeleyev went on to
predict the properties of
the missing elements ac-
cording to their places in
the table. Naturally, no one
paid this serious attention
at the time, but Mende-
leyev turned out to be
right.

Nucleic Acid

The classification of food-
stuffs into carbohydrates,
fats, and proteins (see 1827)
still seemed quite satisfac-
tory.
In 1869, however, a
Swiss biochemist, Johann
Friedrich Miescher (1844—
1895), isolated a substance
from the remnants of cells
in pus that did not belong
to any of these three
classes. It contained both
nitrogen and phosphorus.
Miescher took his new
discovery to Hoppe-Seyler
(see 1862), who investi-
gated the matter himself.
When he discovered a simi-
lar substance in yeast, the
discovery was announced.
Since the material seemed
to originate in cell nuclei, it
was called nuclein at first,
and later, because it had

'Y

acidic properties, nucleic
acid.

It was not till three-
quarters of a century later
that the true and over-
whelming importance of
nucleic acid was appreci-
ated.

Critical
Temperature

The Irish physical chemist
Thomas Andrews (1813—
1885) worked on the lique-
faction of gases, particu-
larly carbon dioxide, a gas
that can be turned into a
liquid at ordinary tempera-
tures by pressure alone.

Andrews carefully
raised the temperature of
carbon dioxide and found
that, as the temperature
went up, more and more
pressure was required to
liquefy it. Finally, at 31°C,
no pressure he could apply
would turn the trick. The
gas might become as dense
as a liquid, but it would
still retain gaseous proper-
ties.

Andrews therefore sug-
gested, in 1869, that for
every gas there was a criti-
cal temperature above
which pressure alone could
not liquefy it. This was use-
ful for chemists to know, be-
cause in their efforts to
liquefy the so-called perma-
nent gases, they would
clearly have to lower the

“Ul

temperature below the crit-
ical temperature first, and
only then apply pressure.

Biogeography

Wallace (see 1838) noticed
that the animal species of
Australia were quite differ-
ent than those of Asia. In
1869 he drew a line separat-
ing the two types of ani-
mals (a line still called
Wallace's line), which fol-
lowed the deep-water chan-
nel between the large
islands of Borneo and Bali
to the west and Celebes and
Lombok to the east.

Clearly, the animals in
Australia and Asia had
been separated for a long
time and had gone their
separate evolutionary
ways. Out of this grew the
notion of dividing animal
species into large continen-
tal and supercontinental
blocks. This founded the sci-
ence of biogeography.

Islets of
Langerhans

The German physician Paul
Langerhans (1847—-1888),
while working for his medi-
cal degree, studied the mi-
croscopic structure of the
pancreas, a digestive gland
second in size only to the
liver. In 1869, in his disser-
tation, he noted that it con-
tained numerous small
