Magellanic
Supermnova

The last supernova that
had been visible in our own
Milky Way Galaxy was one
studied by Kepler in 1604.
Since then, the nearest su-
pernova had been one spied
2,300,000 light-years away
in the Andromeda galaxy
(see 1886), but at the time
it was not known to be a su-
pernova and was not care-
fully studied even with the
instruments then available.
Since then, the only super-
novas to have been noted
had been in still more dis-
tant galaxies.

In February 1987, how-
ever, a supernova was
caught in its early explo-
sive stage in the Large Mag-
ellanic Cloud. That was not
in our own galaxy to be
sure, but it was in the gal-
axy closest to our own, only
150,000 light-years away.

The explosion had been
heralded by a spray of neu-
trinos, some of which were
caught in recently devised
neutrino telescopes. Un-
doubtedly, as more and bet-
ter instruments of the sort
are built, the sky will be
regularly scanned for neu-
trinos that may herald su-
pernova explosions.

The Magellanic super-
nova was carefully studied
as the light built up and
faded and as the nebulosity
about it expanded and
thinned. In 1988 the ex-
pected appearance of a pul-
sar at its center rotating
two thousand times per sec-
ond was reported.

Warm Super-
conductivity

Ever since superconductiv-
ity had been discovered by
Kamerlingh Onnes (see
1911), scientists had tried

to find materials that were
superconductive at as high
a temperature as possible
in order to make super-
efficient electrical conduc-
tion practical in everyday
applications. All the metal-
lic elements were studied,
as were large numbers of
alloys, but no superconduc-
tivity was found at temper-
atures higher than 23
degrees above absolute zero
(23° K). This meant that su-
perconductivity could only
be experienced at liquid he-
lium temperatures, and lig-
uid helium is an expensive
commodity.

Liquid hydrogen exists
only at temperatures
higher than 20° K, and the
superconductivity transi-
tion point would have to be
substantially higher than
that to make it completely
useful in a liquid hydrogen
bath. Even if it could be
done, liquid hydrogen,
while less expensive than
