cles were bulky, clumsy,
and slow. Even fairly ad-
vanced ones, built much
later, took time to start, be-
cause water had to be
heated and boiled first.

The coming of the inter-
nal-combustion engine, es-
pecially the Otto four-
stroke engine (see 1876), of-
fered a much better hope.
What was needed now was
an appropriate fuel, and
eventually that turned out
to be gasoline, a petroleum

 

fraction with smaller mole-
cules than those of kero-
sene, so that it vaporized
more easily and burned
more readily.

The first working auto-
mobile with a gasoline-
burning internal-combus-
tion engine was built in

early 1885 by a German me-

chanical engineer, Carl
Friedrich Benz (1844â€”
1929). Its wheels looked
like bicycle wheels, and
there were three of them, a

 

smaller one in front and
two larger ones in back. It
ran at a speed of 9 miles
per hour, and it was the
forerunner of all that was
to follow.

Fingerprints

In 1885 Galton (see 1883)
pointed out the individual-
ity of fingerprints. No two
people (barring identical
twins) had identical fin-
gerprints, and Galton
