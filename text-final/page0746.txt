Neptune and
Triton

On August 25, Voyager 2
flew within 3,000 miles of
the pale-blue-gas giant Nep-
tune, making dramatic dis-
coveries about the planet
and its moons.

Neptune rotates once
every 16.1 hours. While its
blue color comes from the
presence of methane gas,
its atmosphere’s most prey-
alent gases are hydrogen
and helium. The weather
on Neptune is extremely dy-
namic, with the fastest
winds—up to 1,500 mph—
detected on any planet.
Like Jupiter, with its Great
Red Spot, Neptune has an
especially turbulent atmo-
spheric storm—as large in
diameter as the planet
Earth—that scientists have
dubbed the Great Dark
Spot.

Neptune's planetary
magnetism is unusual com-
pared to that of Earth,
whose magnetic pole is cen-
tered and closely aligned
with its geographic pole.
For reasons that are not yet
understood, Neptune's
magnetic axis is steeply
tilted (about 50°) in relation
to its rotational axis. Just

as puzzling is the fact that
the magnetic field is consid-
erably offset from the
planet’s center. From afar,
Neptune’s rings look like
partial “ring arcs,” seem-
ingly interrupted in places
as they circled the planet.
Data from Voyager revealed
that the four major rings—
probably, like those of Sa-
turn and Uranus, composed
partly of water ice and de-
bris from the breakup of
colliding small moons—
seem interrupted because
they vary in density and
structure. One theory is
that such uneven composi-
tion indicates an aging ring
structure.

Voyager 2 discovered
six new Neptunian moons
—three with very dark sur-
faces and irregularly
shaped, the largest 250
miles in diameter—for a
total of eight known satel-
lites. The makeup of the
planet’s rings has led to
speculation that there may
be more, smaller moons.

Neptune's largest
moon, Triton, had first
been seen in 1846, the same
year Neptune was discov-
ered. Like Saturn’s Titan
and Jupiter’s [o, Triton has
an atmosphere and a sur-
face temperature (—391° F)

that make it one of the
Solar System’s coldest
worlds. Geysers erupt with
five-mile-high plumes of ni-
trogen and methane, and a
pinkish-white polar cap
composed of the same gases
freezes and sublimes, its lo-
cation shifting with the sea-
sons.

Neptune was Voyager's
last planetary stop in an
odyssey that is planned to
continue for another two
decades. Its next mission is
to explore interstellar
space.

Cold Fusion

For years researchers had
looked for a feasible means
of producing nuclear fu-
sion, which occurs when
atomic nuclei combine, re-
leasing energy (see 1951,
Stellarator). The problem
was that the known meth-
ods of combining nuclei re-
quired great amounts of
heat to initiate the reac-
tion. Scientists had been
trying to develop a way to
contain the required heat,
with no practical solutions
yet reported.

nouncement by American
chemist B. Stanley Pons (b.
