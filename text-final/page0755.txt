the exponent # is greater
than two (see 1637). Fermat
never recorded his proof,
and mathematicians ever
since have tried without
success to prove Fermat's
Last Theorem.

Thus a milestone
seemed to have been
reached when British math-
ematician Andrew John
Wiles (b. 1953) announced

in July that he had estab-
lished the truth of the fa-
mous theorem. While a
year or two would be re-
quired for the 200-page
proof to be thoroughly scru-
tinized and confirmed,
Wiles's reputation was
excellent, and on first re-
view by his mathematical
peers the proof was highly
acclaimed.

Wiles cracked the Fer-
mat case by first solving a
related math riddle central
to number theory, the Tani-
yama Conjecture, which
deals with elliptical curves.
As part of the process of lay-
ing Fermat's 356-year-old
problem to rest, Wiles also
developed new techniques
for dealing with important
issues in number theory.
