to work on the swaying
deck of a ship, and the
watches of the time were in-
sufficiently accurate.

In 1714 the British gov-
ernment offered a prize of
twenty thousand pounds,
an incredible fortune in
those days, to anyone who
would devise a method of
determining a ship’s longi-
tude. The sum was clearly
worth it, to be sure, consid-
ering the improvement it
would make in a ship’s abil-
ity to navigate accurately
and the profits that would
result from accelerated
trade.

Beginning in 1728, an
English instrument-maker,
John Harrison (1693—1776),
built a series of five clocks,
each one better than the
one before. Each clock was
so mounted that it could
take the sway of a ship with-
out being adversely af-
fected. He designed a
pendulum of different met-
als so that it would stay the
same length and give the
same beat even as tempera-
ture changed. He also in-
serted a mechanism that
would keep the clock going
while it was being wound.
Any one of Harrison's
clocks met the demands of
the prize conditions. In
fact, they were more accu-
rate at sea than any other
clock then known was on
land. One of Harrison's

chronometers was off by
less than a minute after five
months at sea.

The British parliament,
however, put on an extraor-
dinary display of miserli-
ness in this connection. It
put off the payment to Har-
rison for years, and he did
not get the full amount
until 1773.

Aberration
of Light

Since Copernicus’s book
(see 1543) nearly two centu-
ries before, the question of
the parallax of the stars
had bothered astronomers.
If the Earth did indeed
move about the Sun, that
should induce a parallactic
displacement among the
nearer stars as compared
with the farther ones. View-
ing a nearby star from one
side of the Sun and then
viewing it again from the
other side, 186,000,000
miles away, should produce
a displacement—but it
didn't.

Those who accepted Co-
pernicus and Kepler felt
this was because even the
nearest stars were so far
away that their parallax
was too small to measure.
Still, telescopes were con-
stantly improving, so as-
tronomers kept trying.

One of those who tried
was a British astronomer,

James Bradley (1693~
1762). Bradley, using a tele-
scope 212 feet long, tried to
measure the small displace-
ment of stars in the course
of the year and actually de-
tected such a displacement.
What he found, however,
could not be parallax, be-
cause the displacement did
not coincide with what
would be expected if it
were the result of Earth's
changing position in its
orbit.

Bradley looked for an
alternate explanation and
one occurred to him in
1728: The displacement
arose because the telescope
had to be tipped slightly to
catch the light as the Earth
moved (this is called ad-
justing to the aberration of
light), just as an umbrella
must be tipped when you're
walking briskly through a
rainstorm in which the
drops are falling vertically.
The amount by which the
telescope must be tipped
depends on the ratio of the
speed of the Earth in its
orbit to the speed of light.

This meant that al-
though Bradley had not de-
tected parallax, he had
discovered a new way of
calculating the speed of
light, since the speed of the
Earth in its orbit was
known and the amount of
the tipping of the telescope
was known, too. This was
the first determination of
