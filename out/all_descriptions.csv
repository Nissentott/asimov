-2000000,Bipedality,"['Auman', 'Plato', 'Suppose', 'Bears', 'Bipedality', 'Raymond Arthur Dart', 'Dart', 'Donald Johanson', 'Lucy', 'Lucy Afars', 'Australopithecines', 'Africa', 'Lucy Bipedality']","['Latin', 'Greek', 'Plato', 'Long', 'South African', 'South African Australopithecus', 'Greek American', 'Australopithecus']","The first human advance was biological. It consisted of becoming human.

We might ask what makes a human being human. What part is sufficiently Auman so that we can at once point to it and say, “This is human. Without it, this organism would be something else.”

The human being of today has, of course, evolved many characteristics that are now considered human, so many that it is difficult to point to any one of them and consider it the key. What we must do, then, is go back in time, watching humanity become more and more primitive, less human, more apelike.

Yet we must stop at some point where our ancestors are still more nearly human than they are apish. Any organism that is more human than ape is called a hominid (from a Latin word for “man’’). Any organism that is more ape than human is called a pongid (from a Congolese word for “ape”’).

Therefore, we might recast the first sentence of this section to read “The

first hominid advance was biological. It consisted of becoming hominid.”

As we go back in time, studying the bones and teeth (all that remain) of earlier forms of hominid life, we come to an organism that was perhaps the size of a modern chimpanzee or even a little smaller and with a brain that was no larger. Yet in one crucial respect, it was much closer to the human than to the ape. This human characteristic is so obvious that, if we were to see the organism in real life, we would at once say, “This is no ape.”

It was the first hominid, and what made it so was its bipedality. It walked on two legs, as we can tell from the shape of its spinal column, its pelvic girdle, and its thighbones.

The fact that human beings walk on two legs strikes us as characteristically human. We are bipeds (from Latin words for “two legs”), while other mammals are quadrupeds (four legs).

Of course birds walk, run, or hop on two legs, and the Greek philosopher Plato (ca. 427—ca. 347 B.C.) therefore defined a human

being as a “‘featherless biped.” That is insufficient, however, for there are bipeds with fur (kangaroos and jerboas) and bipeds with scales (various dinosaurs), which Plato knew nothing about.

Let’s consider bipedality, then, to see what makes human bipedality different from other types.

Animals that are bipedal are often restricted to two legs because two others have been devoted to some other (and preferred) form of locomotion. Most birds are designed to be flyers, and the forelegs have become wings for that purpose. Penguins are swimmers, and the forelegs have become flippers. In either case, walking, running, or hopping is secondary.

There are, of course, nonflying birds like ostriches, for which walking or running on two legs is the only means of locomotion. In such cases, the body is designed for it and is essentially horizontal, so that there are roughly equal amounts of it at front and rear. With the two legs centered, bipedality is a mechanically easy thing to

maintain. This is also true of bipedal reptiles and mammals like the tyrannosaur and the kangaroo. Long tails provide balance, and the body remains essentially horizontal.

Suppose, though, a quadruped’s body ends at the hips and there is no tail to act as a balance. In that case, the only way the body'’s center of gravity can be brought above the hind legs is to tip the entire body into a vertical position.

Some tailless animals actually do this. Bears and chimpanzees can stand upright on their hind legs and even walk about in this fashion, but they are clearly uncomfortable doing so and prefer to let the forelegs share the work. Penguins, too, hold their bodies upright, but they are swimmers and clumsy on land. Though they can walk long distances if they must, they prefer to belly-whop on ice when they can.

The human being, then, is a tailless, habitual, and comfortable biped. But what is it that makes the human a comfortable walker on two legs?

It is that the spinal column, just above the pelvis, bends backward in human beings, assuming a shallow S-shape and adding a spring to the human walk that makes it comfortable.

No other organism has that backward bend of the spine in the small of the back. Bipedality also produces problems. There are slipped disks, inflamed sinuses, and accidental falls, for instance. None of these would be likely were it not that human beings are still not entirely adapted to walking upright.)

The earliest hominids were first identified by an Australian-born South African anthropologist, Raymond Arthur Dart (1893— 1988), to whom a skull, rather human-looking except for its extraordinarily small size, was brought from a South African limestone quarry in 1924. Dart, in 1925, named the type of organism to which the skull belonged Australopithecus (from Greek words meaning “‘southern ape”). Further finds made it clear that it was not an ape but a hominid, and at least four different species have now been identified, which are lumped together as australopithecines.

In 1974 an American anthropologist, Donald Johanson, unearthed an unprecedentedly complete and ancient skeleton of an australopithecine female, who was given the name Lucy. (You can tell a female from a male by the shape of its pelvis.) [t was possibly

as much as four million years old judging from the age of the rocks in which it was found.

Lucy is an example of Australopithecus afarensis, because Afars is the name of the region in east-central Africa where her remains were found. Australopithecines existed only in castern and southern Africa, so east-central Africa may have been the cradle of humanity.

Lucy was the size of a chimpanzee and slighter in build. Her australopithecine relatives seem to have ranged between 3 and 4 feet in height and to have weighed perhaps 65 pounds. Their brains were no larger than a chimpanzee's and about a quarter the size of our own.

The early australopithecines probably lived much as chimpanzees do, may have spent their time partly in trees, must have been very largely vegetarian, and undoubtedly could not speak. However, they were as bipedal as we are and walked as casily and as comfortably on their hind legs as we do.

Why did the australopithecines develop the backward bend in the spine? Why did the processes of evolution invent the hominid, in other words?

Four million years ago the Earth had been warm for quite a while, and large tropical animals, such as elephants, rhinoceroses, and hippopotamuses, tended to lose their hair because such insulation kept them too warm. For some reason, the hominids also lost their hair though they were much smaller than other hairless mammals. We don’t know at what stage hair was lost.

The Earth of the australopithecines was turning cooler, however. The forests shrank and were replaced by grasslands. Those organisms whose habitat was the forest and who did not give up the trees naturally retreated with the forest.

Some arboreal prehominids managed to adapt to the grasslands in east-central Africa and to spend more and more time out of the trees. It must have been a difficult transition. As they spent more time on

the ground, they had an increasing tendency to rise to their hind legs and peer about over the tall grass, searching for food or watching out for predators. Those who could stand upright more easily and could do so for longer intervals were better able to survive.

Even a slight crook in the spine, which made standing upright slightly easier, gave those who had it a better chance of surviving, and of having children to inherit that crook. What we call natural selection would thus drive the prehominids toward bipedality and a true hominid character.

Bipedality had side effects that were also beneficial and that reinforced the natural-selection drive. The forelimbs were freed for duty as something other than support. The freed hands could more easily manipulate portions of the environment, feel them,

and bring them close to the eyes, ears, and nose, so that the brain was continually flooded with sensations.

Any change that made the brain a bit larger or more complex made it possible for the brain to handle the flood of sensation more efficiently, and this led to an improved chance of survival. Thus, natural selection introduced a drive for bigger and better brains.

The early australopithecines, with a brain as large as that of a chimpanzee but with a body that was slighter, already had a larger brain-to-body ratio than any pongid then or since. Since the brain-tobody ratio is a crucial factor in what we call intelligence (provided the brain is reasonably large), the australopithecines were probably the most intelligent land animals existing in their time.

-500000,Stone Tools,"['Homo', 'Louis Seymour Bazett Leakey', 'Mary', 'Homo Latin', 'Homwo', 'Homo Hominids']","['English', 'Tanzania', 'Homo', 'Homo Homo']","Sometimes, we think of the human being as a toolusing animal. Tool-using is not really unique to human beings, however. For exam-

ple, sea otters routinely smash shellfish against a rock they carry for the purpose on their abdomens as they float belly-up. A long litany of other examples could also be given.

If we change that to tool-making animal, we are somewhat better off, but not entirely. Chimpanzees have been seen to strip leaves from twigs and then use the bare twigs as de vices for capturing termites, which to them are tasty snacks.

Undoubtedly, australopithecines could do anything that chimpanzees could do. We have no evidence, but we can be fairly certain that they used tree branches and long bones as clubs. They could surely throw rocks or use them as sea otters do.

The australopithecines may have existed on Earth for three million years, not becoming finally extinct till as late as 1,000,000 B.c. For the final third of their existence, though, they were no longer the only hominids. Some australopithecines had evolved to the point where they had become sufficiently human to be placed in the same genus with ourselves.

About two million years ago, in other words, genus Homo came into existence. For a time, it coexisted with the australopithecines, but there was bound to be conflict between them, and in this, the larger and brainier hominids won out, contributing (very largely, perhaps) to the extinction of the australopithecines.

In the 1960s, the English anthropologist Louis Seymour Bazett Leakey (1903—1972), his wife, Mary, and their son, Jona-

than, located remains of the oldest of the genus Homo in the Olduvai Gorge, in what is now Tanzania. The hominids thus uncovered were named Homo habilis (Latin for “able man,"" because with them were discovered objects that seemed to indicate that they made simple stone tools).

Homwo habilis was smaller than some of the larger species of australopithecines. When, in the summer of 1986, fossil remains of Homo habilis were discovered that were some 1.8 million years old (the first time that both skull fragments and limb bones of the same individual of that species had been located), they seemed to represent a small, light adult about 3'» feet tall and with arms that were surprisingly long.

Though members of Homo habilis may have been small, they had more rounded heads than any of the australopithecines and larger brains, nearly half as large as those of modern human beings. They had thinner skull bones, and based on the brain configuration, if they could not talk, they could at least make a greater variety of sounds. Their hands were more like our modern hands, and their feet were

completely modern. Their jaws were less massive, so that their faces looked less apelike.

These creatures apparently used stone tools to chip pieces of {lint and so create a sharp edge. This meant that for the first time, hominids had sharp edges in quantity and did not have to depend on the chance finding of one. Moreover the edges could be made truly sharp, and the sharpness could be renewed when the rock was blunted.

These stone knives increased the food supply. Homo habilis could not tear away at the tough hides of animals, as fanged predators such as the various cats, dogs, and bears could. Without knives, hominids had to make do with carcasses that had already been mangled by other predators and to make off with what they could scavenge.

With knives, however, Homo habilis had artificial fangs that could slit hides and scrape the meat off hides and bones. What's more, Homo habilis no longer had to scavenge. Hominids could now kill animals on their own, even fairly large animals. And once they caught on to the trick of tying stone axes to wooden branches and creat

ing the first crude spears, they could stab animals at a distance. If the spears were thrown, the distance could be made long enough

to obviate immediate retaliation.

Hominids became hunters and killed off the competing australopithe-

cines, no doubt, so that for the last million years, all hominids, without exception, have been part of genus Homo.

-200000,Fire,"['Marie Eugene Dubois', 'Dubois', 'Davidson Black', 'Homo', 'Dubois Homo', 'Earth', 'Earth Homo', 'Fire', 'Meat', 'Finally']","['Homo', 'Homo Homo', 'Homo Africa', 'Africa', 'Europe', 'Asia', 'Indonesian', 'Homo Indonesian', 'Java', 'Dutch', 'Greek', 'Peking', 'Canadian', 'Greek Homo', 'Dubois', 'Asian', 'Indonesian Homo', 'Homo Asia', 'Peking Homo']","By 1,600,000 B.c., Homo habilis was gone. For one thing, it had evolved into a new species, Homo erectus, with members about as large and as heavy as modern human beings. If any examples of Homo habilis existed after the new species had established itself, they didn'’t last long.

Between 1,000,000 B.c. and 300,000 B.c., Homo erectus was the only hominid in existence. It was the first hominid that could, in some cases, attain a height of as much as 6 feet and weigh over 150 pounds. The brain was larger, too, sometimes three-fourths as heavy as that of modern human beings.

Homo erectus made much better stone tools than had been made before. As hunters, its members were capable of taking on the biggest animals they could find. They were the first hominids who could hunt mammoths successfully.

Homo erectus made

two particularly enormous advances.

All the hominids, for as much as three and a half million years, had been confined to the southeastern half of Africa. Homo erectus was the first hominid to expand that range significantly. By 500,000 B.c. Homo erectus had moved into the rest of Africa, into Europe and Asia, and even into the Indonesian islands.

In fact, the first discoveries of the remains of Homo erectus were made on the Indonesian island of Java, where the Dutch anthropologist Marie Eugene Dubois (1858—-1940) discovered a skullcap, a femur, and two teeth in 1894. No hominid with so small a brain had yet been discovered, and Dubois named it Pithecanthropus erectus (from Greek words meaning “‘erect ape-man’’).

Similar finds were made near Peking, beginning in 1927, by a Canadian anthropologist, Davidson Black (1884-1934). He named his hominid Sinanthropus pekinensis

(Greek for ““Chinaman from Peking”’).

Eventually it was recognized that both sets of remains, along with others, were of the same species and deserved to belong to genus Homo. Dubois’s term erectus was kept, even though hominids had been walking erect for at least two and a half million years before Homo erectus had evolved. This was not known in Dubois’s time, however.

By the time Homo erectus had evolved, the Earth was in a glacial period. When the glaciers were at their peak, they withdrew so much water from the sea that the sea level dropped as much as 300 feet, exposing the continental shelves under the shallow sections. It was this that made it possible for Homo erectus to wander from the Asian continent to the Indonesian islands.

The cold weather enforced new habits. Homo erectus traveled in bands, as earlier hominids must have, but made shelters by

building up stones to break the wind, or by suspending hides from a central pole. These were the first crude homes. Where caves existed, Homo erectus found shelter there. The first traces of Homo erectus in Asia (Black’s findings near Peking) were in a filled-up cave.

The cave near Peking had traces of campfires. This meant that fire had been “discovered”” some five hundred thousand years ago. Here is a characteristic that marks off human beings from all other organisms. Every human society in existence, however primitive, has understood and made use of fire. No living creature other than human beings uses fire in even the most primitive fashion.

I have put discovered in quotation marks, for fire was not discovered in the usual sense. Lightning could start a fire ever since Earth’s atmosphere gained enough oxygen to sustain one and Earth's land surface possessed a forest cover that could burn, and that means for some four hundred million years. From that fire, then as now, any animal capable of fleeing would flee.

By the discovery of fire, then, we really mean its taming. At some time, Homo erectus learned how

to retrieve some burning object from the edge of a naturally caused fire, keep the fire alive by feeding it judicious amounts of fuel whenever it showed signs of dying down, and make good use of it.

How this happened we don’t know. My own guess is that it began when children grew fascinated by leaping flames. With their overactive curiosity, and with the lack of bitter experience of what happens when one is burnt, they might be more likely to play with it than adults would be. Presumably, the nearest adult would snatch the child away from the fire and stamp it out. On the other hand, the time might come when an adult, more venturesome than most, might see the advantage of continuing the play in a more purposeful manner.

The use of fire changed human life completely. For one thing, it gave light in the dark and warmth at any time. This made it possible to extend activity into nighttime and winter, which would be particularly important in a glacial period for it meant Homo erectus could extend its range into the cooler regions.

Of course with fire alone one is condemned in cold weather to hug the hearth, but a hunting soci-

ety could easily get the notion of scraping an animal hide clean and wrapping oneselfin it. In this way, animal fur would replace the hair human beings had lost.

Fire was also useful as a means of protection from other animals, even the fiercest. A fire in a cave or within a circle of stones would keep the predators away. They might snarl and slink about the outskirts, but if they were not intelligent enough to stay away from fire, one experience of its nearness was all they would need. In fact, Homo erectus could now carry burning branches to scare game and send it stampeding into traps and off cliffs.

Then, too, fire made it possible to cook food. This is more important than might appear. Meat is tenderer and tastier if roasted. What's more, roasting kills parasites and bacteria so that the meat is safer to eat. Eventually fire made plant food, otherwise inedible, supremely edible. Try eating rice fresh from the stalk, or uncooked grain of any kind, and you'll understand what a little application of heat from a fire can do.

Finally, fire made possible various chemical changes in inanimate matter, such as the smelting of

o

metals. In short, fire introduced humanity’s first age of comparatively “hightech.”

To begin with, of course, fire could be obtained only after it had been started by natural means. Once one had a fire, it had to be kept burning continuously, and if it ever died out, the search for another fire had to be instituted at once. If there was not a nearby tribe from

which fire could be obtained (assuming they were friendly enough to grant it —and they probably would be, for it might be their turn next) then it would be necessary to wait for a natural fire again and hope that conditions would be such that some could be taken safely.

The time came, however, when techniques were developed for starting a fire where none had been be-

fore. This could be done by friction: by turning a pointed stick in a depression in another stick, a depression that contained very dry shreds of wood, leaves, or fungus (tinder). The heat of friction might eventually ignite the tinder. We don'’t know when such methods were first developed, but the technique for starting a fire represents another enormous step forward.

-200000,Religion,"['Neander Valley', 'Paul Broca', 'Homo']","['Homo', 'Germany', 'German', 'Neanderthal', 'Homo Homo', 'Neanderthal French', 'Homo Nean', 'Africa', 'Eurasia']","By 200,000 B.c., the last individuals who might be considered members of Homo erectus were dead

and the species was extinct.

By then, though, some had evolved into hominids whose brains were every bit as large as ours, although they were somewhat differently proportioned, less massive in front and more massive in the rear. They had first appeared not long before this time and were probably instrumental in bringing about the end of the older species.

The first traces of such hominids were discovered in 1856, in the valley of the Neander River in western

Germany. Neander Valley is Neanderthal in German, and the skeletal remains were referred to as Neanderthal man at first, or simply Neanderthals.

These were the first hominids to be discovered. They were clearly different from modern human beings. Their skulls were distinctly less human than our own. They had pronounced eyebrow ridges, large teeth, protruding jaws, and receding foreheads and chins.

Because they were the first hominids to be discovered, and because the Western world still believed strongly that the Earth was only a few thousand years old (as the Bible seemed to imply), there was a certain reluctance to accept the Ne-

anderthal bones as remains of an early form of Homo sapiens. Some preferred to consider them remains of ordinary members of Homo sapiens who were suffering from some sort of bone disease or other abnormality.

When more examples of Neanderthal skeletons were found and all had the same kind of skulls, however, the notion of abnormality could not be maintained. The French anthropologist Paul Broca (1824—1880) marshalled the arguments in favor of Neanderthals being a more primitive form of life than we ourselves, and that turned the tide.

The formal name for the Neanderthals was at first Homo neandertha-

lens S

but they were so like

us in all but a few details of

the skull that they were fi-

nally recognized as being of

our species. And why not? There is evidence that they may have interbred with human beings of the present type. They are now referred to as Homo sapiens neanderthalensis and are considered one of the two known subspecies of Homo sapiens. We moderns are the other.

The Neanderthals lived from 200,000 B.c. to 30,000

were scavenged by preda tors and what was left over rotted. The fact that Nean derthals buried their dead, thus preserving them from scavengers, 1f not from decay bacteria, tends to show that they valued life somehow, felt affection,

In short, this was the kind of hominid, quite exactly, that we are. We are Homo sapiens sapiens, and we are sometimes referred to as modern man, though modern human beings is more appropriate terminology to make it clear that men, women, and children are meant and not only men.

Between 50,000 B.c. and 30,000 B.c., the two varieties of Homo sapiens coexisted, but by the latter date, some interbreeding and probably a great deal of slaughter had put an end to the Neanderthals, so that for the last thirty thousand years or so, all living hominids have been of the modern type.

Modern human beings were extremely successful. For the first time, they extended the range beyond where Homo erectus had left it. Between 40,000 B.c. and 30,000 B.c., human beings took advantage of the

existence of land bridges that the fall in sea level had produced. They entered Australia from southeastern Asia, and North America from northeastern Asia. No hominids had existed in either continent before. They also found their way to the Japanese islands.

The new lands were steadily overrun, and by 10,000 B.c. human beings had reached the southernmost part of South America, and even Tierra del Fuego, the island to the south of that continent. All the continental areas except Antarctica and the glaciated areas in the north were settled.

Human beings were hunters, of course, and they had developed rituals to improve their success. One, apparently, was to draw pictures of animals being successfully hunted, in the conviction, perhaps, that life would imitate art, or that the spirits that animated animals would be mollified in this way and would cooperate.

In 1879, a Spanish archaeologist, Marcellino de Sautuola (d. 1888), was excavating Altamira Cave in northern Spain, when his

twelve-year-old daughter, who was with him, spied paintings on the ceiling and cried out “‘Bulls! Bulls!” There were paintings of bison, deer, and other animals in red and black, drawn perhaps as long ago as 20,000 B.c.

The drawings spoke highly of the artists’ skill. If anything were needed to show that early human beings were our intellectual equals, this would do. In the last twenty millennia, we have gained enormous knowledge and experience, but we are not one whit more human than those ancient cave artists.

So excellent was the art, in fact, that many people refused to believe it was truly ancient. Many felt it to be a fraud of some sort, a modern hoax. It was only with the finding of other caves and other cave paintings that the art was finally accepted as ancient.

The cave paintings were found in remote places and were invisible except by artificial light, so that it is believed they were drawn for religious and ritualistic purposes rather than for display. Neverthe-

less, they are clearly the re-

sult of infinite pains, and it

is hard to believe that the artists did not derive joy from their work.

-12000,Bows and Arrows,['Bows'],[],"In some of the early art, there are clear depictions of bows and arrows being used. How old the bow and arrow are is uncertain, but they were in use by 20,000 B.C. at least.

The bow and arrow is an important device because it is the first one invented by human beings in which energy is slowly stored and then released all at once. It made possible attack from a greater distance than with a thrown spear and so was the first truly long-distance weapon.

The value of attacking an infuriated animal much larger than yoursell from as great a distance as possible is clear.

Bows and arrows were eventually used by humans against other humans (as has been true of any object capable of inflicting damage, no matter what the purpose for which it might originally have been designed). The bow remained a prime weapon in warfare right down to the beginning of the fifteenth century.

Wood, however, is not the only possible fuel. People when roasting meat might well have noticed that the fat dripped and flamed.

A smaller fire, then, in more concentrated form, might be obtained by dipping some porous wood in oil and setting it ablaze, thus forming a torch. Still more convenient would be some oil in a container (a hollowed-out stone, for instance) with a wick of some plant fiber inserted into it. The oil would soak into the wick and would burn at its end. It could be carried from place to place to suit one's needs.

There are indications that primitive lamps of this sort may have been in use as long ago as 20,000 B.c.

-8000,Animal Domestication,"['Dogs', 'Herding']","['Kirkuk', 'Iraq', 'Middle East']","In the 1950s, fossil remains of dogs were found along with remains of humans in caves near Kirkuk in what is now northern Iraq. They dated from about 12,000 B.C.

How dogs came to be domesticated is not known, of course. My own guess is that, again, children were

| B

responsible. A child could form a close bond with a puppy that had been found abandoned, or that was left over when the mother was killed either in self-defense or for food. Once the bond was formed, the child would object strenuously to the use of the puppy as food, and parents might oblige.

It would quickly have turned out that dogs, being hunters and pack animals,

will accept a human master as the pack leader. Dogs would go hunting with their masters, help in killing the game, wait for the human beings to take what they wanted, and be satisfied to be thrown a minor share.

In this way human beings, for the first time, obtained the services of another species of animal.

By 10,000 8.c., another step had been taken, with  LRt

the domestication of goats in the Middle East. The goats would be cared for, fed, and encouraged to reproduce. They would supply milk, butter, and cheese and, by dint of judicious culling, meat. What’s more,

since goats eat grass and other substances humans find inedible, the food supply was increased at no cost. (Dogs have to be given food that would otherwise fill human stomachs.)

Until then, people had

found their food by hunting and gathering, with all the insecurities attendant on that. Herding provided a much more secure food

supply.

"
-7000,Agriculture,"['Agriculture', 'Adam', 'Abel', 'Abel Agriculture', 'Jeast', 'Farmers', 'Jarmo', 'Robert J. Braidwood']","['Iraq', 'Eden', 'Cain', 'Cain Iragq', 'American']","Human beings led a nomadic life. As long as hunting was a major source of food, they had to be prepared to follow migrating herds of animals. Even if they lived on plants and on nonmigrating animals, a tribe lingering in one place too long would consume the available food and have to move elsewhere for fresh foraging.

Even when human beings became herders, they remained nomads. The herds had to be taken to fresh pastures now and then, either because of seasonal changes or because of overgrazing.

About 8000 B.c., however, in the same region where animals were first domesticated, something new arrived, heralding a

change greater than any since the first use of fire.

What it amounted to was that plants were domesticated. Somehow it occurred to human beings to plant seeds deliberately, to wait for them to grow, to water them, and to wait for them to ripen while destroying competing plants. Then the plants could be harvested and would serve as food.

It was tedious and back-breaking work, but the net result was that a great deal of food could be obtained, far more than by hunting and gathering, or even herding, since plant life is more copious than animal life.

The coming of herding and agriculture, particularly agriculture, meant that a given area of land could support a larger pop-

ulation than before. There was less starvation, more children survived, and the population increased.

Agriculture began in northern Iraq where wheat and barley grew wild, and it was these that were domesticated. The kernels of grain could be ground into flour that could be stored for months on end without spoiling and could be baked into a tasty and nutritious bread.

Despite the increase in the food supply, farmers must have been very conscious of their labor, a kind of slavery foisted upon them, which even the use of animals didn’t much mitigate. The tale of the Garden of Eden in the Bible may be the product of farmers who remembered with nostalgia a kind of “golden age” when human beings hunted

and gathered in freedom and comparative idleness and wondered what had happened to evict them from this Elysium and force them to earn their bread by the sweat of their brow.

Then too, Adam'’s first two sons were depicted as Abel, a herder, and Cain, a farmer. The farmers increased in population faster than the herders did, and we can well imagine that areas devoted to farming spread and steadily took up space that had earlier been freely used by herders. (The same thing happened in the American West, when the farmers settled the land and fenced in their plots to the discomfiture of the nomadic cowboys.) No wonder the Bible pictures Cain as killing Abel.

Agriculture, for the first time, condemned human beings to a sedentary existence. Once a farm was established, there could be no further wandering. The farmers had to remain with the farm, which was fixed in one place.

A sedentary life had its dangers. As long as human beings hunted and gathered, or even herded, danger could be avoided. If a hungry, marauding tribe approached, intent on taking what food they could find, the tribe already pres-

ent, if they decided fighting would be too dangerous, could always flee.

Farmers could not run, at Jeast not without abandoning their farms and seeing their lifework ruined and themselves faced with starvation. Once the population had increased, thanks to agriculture, they could not possibly find enough food to maintain themselves except by continuing with agriculture— they had a tiger by the tail.

Farmers therefore had to be prepared to fight at whatever cost, and they gathered together for mutual self-protection. They would find a site on an elevation (so that they could throw missiles downward, whereas an enemy would have to throw them upward, with lesser effect) and with a secure water supply (you can go without food for a period of time but not without water). There they would build houses and surround them with a protective wall. The result would be a city, and the inhabitants would be city-dwellers, or citizens.

In northern Iragq, for instance, near the site where herding and agriculture developed, are the remains of a very ancient city, founded perhaps in 8000 B.c., at a site called Jarmo. It is a low mound into which, be-

ginning in 1948, the American archaeologist Robert J. Braidwood dug carefully. He found the remains of houses built with thin walls of packed mud and divided into small rooms. The city may have held no more than a hundred to three hundred people, but cities grew rapidly larger.

Agriculture made it possible for farmers to produce more food than their own families needed. This meant that pes; ‘¢ could do things other than farming —for example, engage in artisanry or art—and trade their products for some of a farmer’s excess food. For the first time, human beings could find time to think of something other than the next meal. In addition, living in close quarters in a city, they could interact easily, and the innovations and ideas of one could be rapidly transmitted to the others.

As a result, the coming of agriculture and of cities meant the coming also of a new and more complex way of life, which we call civilization (from a Latin word for “city-dweller”). The civilized area was small at first, but it spread outward steadily until it now occupies virtually the entire world.

-6000,Pottery,"['Pottery', 'Artisans']",[],"It has always been important for human beings to carry things, and the obvious way to carry them is in the hands, or in the crook of the arm. There is a limit to how much can be carried in this fashion, however. What we needed were artificial hands, so to speak, that were considerably larger than our natural hands.

Objects could be carried in hides, but hides are an inconvenient shape and heavy. Gourds might do, but they have to be taken as they come. Eventually human beings learned to weave twigs or other fibers into baskets. These were light and could be made in any shape.

Baskets, however, were only useful in carrying

solid, dry objects made up of particles considerably larger than the interstices of the weave. Baskets could not be used to carry flour or olive oil, for instance, or most important, water.

It might seem natural to daub baskets with clay, which upon drying would cake the holes and make the basket solid. The dried mud would tend to fall away, however, especially if the basket was shaken or struck. But if the basket was placed in the sun and allowed to bake in direct sunlight, the mud would harden further, and the basket might then become fairly serviceable for carrying powders and fluids.

But then why use the basket? Why not simply begin with clay, mold a container out of it, and let it dry in the sun? You would

then have a pot made of crude earthenware, and some of these may have been formed as early as 9000 B.c. Such pots are soft, however, and don't last long.

Some stronger heat was required. When earthenware was placed in the fire, it became hard pottery, and such pottery can be traced back to perhaps 7000 B.c. This may have been the first use of fire for something other than light, heat, and cooking.

Pottery not only made it possible to carry liquids, it also introduced a new form of cooking. Until then, food had usually been roasted, exposed directly to the flames or to dry heat. Once a pot existed that could hold water and withstand the heat of flames, food could be heated in the

water—it could be boiled.

In this way stews and casse-

roles came into existence

And of course pottery could be decorated and well shaped. Cleverly decor ated examples would be in special demand. Artisans could exchange them for other material they found needful. And since pottery lasts indefinitely, if well cared for, it can change hands often, and one group of people can use it in trading with another group

In early pottery, the clay was pressed and

pounded into the shape of a pot and the result was something quite lumpy and asymmetric but serviceable.

If the pot could be turned, however, a relatively light pressure from the hand would produce a symmetrical cylindrical shape, and by appropriate increases in pressure or by downward pushes, complicated modifications of the basic cylinder could be made while retaining symmetry. This could be done if the clay was placed on a

horizontal, circular slab of wood or stone (a patter wheel), which had a central

spike underneath that

could be balanced in a de pression and the whole turned rapidly

The potter’s wheel was

By 6000 B.c., they must have learned how to lash logs together to form rafts that would keep them out on the surface of quiet bodies of water for a time. By paddling with their hands, if nothing else, they could even cross small stretches of water.

-4000,Sickles,"['Irrigation Agriculture', 'Rainfall', 'Whereas']","['Latin', 'Tigris', 'Iraq', 'Sumeria', 'Egypt']","Human beings had to invent devices that would be of help in dealing with the plants they were trying to exploit. The ripe stalks of grain would have to be cut down, and as early as 6000 B.C., sickles (from a Latin word meaning “to cut’) were used for that purpose. They were essentially knives (originally of sharpened stone) at the end of sticks, which could be used to slash at the base of the stalks.

Once the stalks were

cut down, the grain could be rubbed between two stones to eliminate the chaff and reduce the starch to powder. One stone would have a depression into which the grain could be poured, and the other would be rounded and could be used for grinding, impelled by muscle power. Such a hand-mill is called a quern.

Irrigation Agriculture requires a steady supply of water to keep the plants alive, so it naturally started where rainfall could be counted upon to a reasonable extent. Rainfall, however, even at best, is a chancy thing, and droughts are all too common.

One reliable source of fresh water (the salt water of the sea won't work) is a

sizable river. Farms therefore began to develop along riverbanks.

Whereas rain falls directly on the crops, however, river water generally remains within its banks. In order to correct that situation, it is necessary to dig ditches so that water will flow outward from the river and soak the ground in which the plants are growing. These ditches have to be kept in order and not al-

lowed either to silt up or to overflow.

What'’s more, when the river’s water level falls during a drought, the ditches have to be dug deeper. And since the river occasionally rises in periods of heavierthan-usual rains (not necessarily at the site of the farms, but many miles away, nearer the river’s source), levees have to be built to confine the rising water within the banks.

These have to be tended continually to prevent leaks and breakdowns.

All this irrigation (from Latin words meaning ""'to water inward’’) more or less guarantees a good harvest and an ample food supply, at the cost of unremitting labor.

This labor cannot be done alone, nor can it be done by various people, each in his or her own way and at his and her own time. Irrigation requires cooperation. Many farms depend upon it, and the labor of many has to be supervised to make a coherent whole, so that the levees are in good shape everywhere.

As a result, the farms depend upon control by capable leaders who can supervise the work and allot the tasks, encourage the industrious and capable, and

punish the idle or incompetent. In short, irrigation leads to the formation of what we call government, so that a cluster of farms surrounding a defensible city becomes a city-state, with a ruler and established rules of behavior.

The first such citystates formed along the lower courses of the Euphrates and Tigris rivers in what is now southern Iraq (but was then known as Sumeria) about 5000 B.c. Other city-states developed at nearly the same time along the Nile River in Egypt. It almost never rains in Egypt, but the Nile remains a reliable water supply and overflows regularly once a year when the rainy season takes place far to the south, nearer its source. The Nile (lood deposits fertile mud over the farms on its banks.

Stone is the most durable of these and the most likely to remain as evidence of long-

past human activity. As a result, that long period is known as the Stone Age, a term first used by the Roman poet Titus Lucretius Carus (95-55 B.c.) and reintroduced by a Danish

archacologist, Christian Jiir-

gensen Thomsen (17881865), in 1834. The Stone Age is di-

vided into the Paleolithic, the Mesolithie, and the Neolithic (from Latin words meaning “Old Stone,""” “""Middle Stone,” and "" New Stone,"" respectively) based on advancing techniques of handling the stone. Occasionally, thougl, pebbles that were not like other pebbles must have

v

been found by Stene Age people. For one thing, these occasional odd pebbles were shiny and were heavier than ordinary pebbles of that size. What's more, if these shiny pebbles were struck with a stone hammer, they did not split or shatter as ordinary pebbles did, but they distorted. These occasional pebbles were metals. Dozens of different metals are known, but most of them remain in combination with nonmetallic substances, and rocky substances are the result. Only those metals that are inert and tend not to combine with other substances are likely to be found in a free state. The three inert metals most likely to be found free are rather rare even for metals. These are copper, silver, and gold. Their rareness is shown by the fact that the very word metal is from a Greek term meaning ‘‘to search for.” Metal nuggets exist that were dealt with by human beings as long ago as 5000 B.c. or even earlier. Because of their metallic luster and the fact that they can be beaten into interesting shapes, they were used at first almost exclusively as ornaments. Of these, gold was the most desired, for it was the most beautiful in color (a gleaming yel-

low), the heaviest, and the most inert. It simply doesn’t change with time. Silver, a very light yellow, tends to darken with time, and copper, which is reddish, may even turn green. (Copper is from the word for Cyprus, the island that served as an early source of the metal.)

It was only when human beings discovered that metals could be obtained from special rocks called ores that metals became common enough to use for other purposes. Of these, the first to be discovered was copper. Copper is combined with oxygen, carbon, or both in certain rocky ores, and the discovery that copper could be obtained from them in pure form took place about 4000 B.C.

Undoubtedly it was accidental at first. A fierce wood fire might be built on such copper ore. Under the heat of the fire, the carbon in the wood and in the ore would combine with the oxygen in the ore to form the gas carbon dioxide, which would escape, leaving metallic copper behind. Some observant person might notice the reddish globules among the ashes of the fire, and eventually the circumstances would be understood and the ores searched

for and deliberately heated. In this way fire made possible metallurgy—the obtaining of metals from their ores.

Copper ornaments became more common thereafter, but copper could not be used as a tool, though one might think it could. After all, a sharp-edged piece of rock, if chipped, loses its edge, and this cannot be restored without laborious chipping. If a sharp-edged piece of metal is blunted, it can simply and easily be beaten sharp again. However, copper was too easily blunted. It couldn'’t very well be beaten after every minor use.

The reason is that copper ore is not necessarily pure; it may be mixed with other substances that, on being heated, combine with copper to form an alloy.

One such mixture consists of copper and arsenic, but arsenic is poisonous, and people who worked with it must have fallen sick. Such mixed ores were therefore abandoned (perhaps the first known case in which worker

safety was a factor in technology).

Fortunately, another type of ore mixture was discovered that also resulted in the smelting of a hard form of copper. This was a tin ore, and the hard copper was actually a copper-tin alloy. The alloy was called bronze (possibly from a Persian word for “copper”).

Bronze was hard enough to compete with rock. It could hold an edge better and could, of course be beaten back into shape if necessary, though that was not often required

Science in the Ancient World (3500 B.C.—A.D. 475)

While other Middle Eastern cultures were major powers in the ancient world, Egypt was the first nation. Beginning in 3100 B.C., citystates along 500 miles of the River Nile shared a common language and culture. Around the same time, the first European civilization developed on the island of Crete. By 2500 B.C., Chinese civilization arose along the Yellow River, and agriculture began to develop in Central America. The science and technology of these early times was initially practical—metallurgy for tools and weapons; astronomy for telling time and knowing when to plant and harvest; mathematics and geometry for measurement, navigation, and architecture. A quantum leap in communications was made around 1500 B.c., when Phoenician traders created the alphabet—symbols used not for ideas but for the sounds that make up words. This revolutionary method made writing and reading much easier. Before the ascendancy of the Greeks, the Phoenicians

were the supreme seafarers of the Mediterranean— and beyond. By 1100 B.c., they were using star constellations to guide their oar-powered ships into territories in the western Mediterranean and beyond. The greatest scientific contribution of the Greeks, whose culture began to flourish around 800 B.c., was their approach. In their search for general principles that would describe how the world worked, they evolved theories based on what they could prove. Unlike the great cultures that had preceded them, the Greeks separated science from religion and superstition. Their astronomical investigations yielded results that far surpassed earlier knowledge, and they were the first to consider mathematics apart from the practicalities of calculation

and measurement, developing over a period of eight hundred years methods of reasoning in geometry and algebra that form the basis for modern mathematics. Practical applications were not, of

course, ignored. For example, among the numerous discoveries and innovations of Archimedes were an explanation of the principle of buoyancy and the theory of how levers work. Besides laying out the system of rational thought we call logic, Aristotle is recognized as the father of the life sciences. He examined and classified more than five hundred species of animals, and his student Theophrastus did the same for a similar number of plant species. The Greek physician Hippocrates is called the father of medicine because, in the fifth century B.C., he rejected the idea that illness was a result of supernatural intervention. Greek physicians were the first to dissect the human body, beginning about 500 B.c. By 100 B.c., Greece had declined and Rome was supreme in the Mediterranean world. The Romans were not innovators, but they did find practical uses for Greek knowledge—especially in engineering and construetion—and as the Roman

Empire spread so did the extent of learning. When the empire collapsed to-

ward the end of the fifth century A.p., scientific inquiry came to an end in

Europe. The Dark Ages had begun.

-3500,Wheeled Carts,[],['Sumeria'],"Where objects are too heavy to be carried by hand, transportation over land becomes a problem. Even where land is fairly smooth, there is considerable friction, whether the ground is sandy, pebbly, or grassy.

Heavy objects had to be dragged on sledges by sheer force at first, and even when animals stronger than humans were used (oxen, for instance), it was slow going.

It could be made easier if crude rollers in the form of woaden logs were placed under sledges. The rollers turned rather than dragged, and that cut down on friction considerably. It meant less work, but might actually take more time, as rollers had to be picked up from the back and put down again in front. What is needed is an axle and wheels.

We don't know how someone came to think of attaching two rollers to the sledge back and front in such a way that they rolled

inside the straps that held them and remained with the sledge at all times. At the end of each roller, solid wooden wheels were then placed to lift the sledge off the ground, and the wheels turned freely.

A wheeled cart moves more quickly and with far less effort than a sledge, even a sledge on rollers, so that such carts marked a revolution in land transportation. They made trade easier, for one thing.

Such carts had showed up in Sumeria by 3500 B.c.

Water offers much less friction than land does, and there are no permanent unevennesses in it: no rocks, no ridges, no uphill stretches.

In this connection, the Nile was ideal. Not only was it a source of water for rainless Egypt—not only did its annual flood periodically fertilize the soil—but its current was gentle and

there were no storms. The Nile did not damage and overturn boats as the unruly Tigris in Sumeria did. (The very name of that river is the Greek word for “tiger."""")

What's more, the Nile flows almost due north, while the wind is almost always from the north. Therefore a boat can move smoothly down river and, when the time comes to return, a sail can be hoisted to catch the wind and the ship will be blown upstream.

Egypt is not a forest nation, but it had luxuriani stands of reeds (called papyrus) along the river in those days, and the reeds could be used in bundles to build boats. The boats were built to form hollows, so that they would displace more water and carry more weight without sinking. These reed boats were not particularly sturdy, but the gentle Nile did not require sturdy boats. (When Moses was set afloat in the Nile River, he was placed in a little boat—or ark—of bulrushes; that is, papyrus.)  Egypt thus had a most

convenient form of commu-

nication that perhaps accounted for its slowness to adopt the Sumerian wheeled cart. Egypt had scarcely any need for land transportation.

boats had begun to ply the Nile, and by 3000 B.c. they were venturing out of the Nile into the Mediterra1ean, hugging the shore,

-3100,Writing,"['Sumeria', 'Egypt']","['Greek', 'Egyptian', 'Greek Greeks']","Because Sumeria was the most advanced and complex civilization in the world, life was more com-

plex too. People had to keep track of the grain they produced, how much they traded, what they bought and sold, and what they contributed to the common fund (in what we call taxes).

It became more and more difficult to keep it all in mind. We can say this without casting aspersions on the extraordinary powers of a trained memory. It was necessary to keep score.

Almost anyone can think of making some sort of mark in the ground to stand for a basket full of fruit and then eventually counting the marks in order to know how many baskets have been delivered. It’s just that if society is simple, there is no need to take the trouble to do this.

However, as the memory becomes strained, such marks are made. In order to simplify matters, different marks would be made for one, five, and ten, perhaps so that there would not be too many unit-marks to count. This would lead on to a mark that meant fruit and another that meant grain and still another that meant man and so on. Eventually there would be marks, perhaps crude pictures at first, for every different object. If different people agree on the marks and learn how to

make them and how to interpret them, you have writing.

The Sumerians seem to have been the first to work out a writing system, using a stylus that produced wedge-shaped marks in soft clay. This was later called cuneiform, from Greek words meaning ""‘wedgeshaped.” As time went on, the symbols became more styvlized and somewhat simpler and lost their function as pictorial representations. Nevertheless, each symbol stood for a word, more or less, so that anyone who wanted to read and write had to memorize hundreds and even thousands of different symbols.

This meant that the literates (those who could read and write) were always a small minority of the population, but that was all that was needed in those days to run the society.

Egypt picked up the notion of writing and invented a totally different set of signs, as complicated in its way as the cuneiform.

The Egyptian writing is called hieroglyphic (from Greek words meaning ""priestly writing,"" because the Greeks came into contact with it mostly in Egyptian temples), It was brushed onto thin flexible sheets of papyrus pith.

Writing makes an enormous difference. It is a kind of frozen speech. Thoughts and records remain much more permanent than the spoken word and, if carefully copied now and then, persist indefinitely and remain more precise than the memory of the spoken word usually is.

This means that each generation can learn, more precisely and quickly, the accumulated experience and wisdom of the previous generation, and advances quicken as a result.

Furthermore, the records kept in writing give us a reasonably exact version of events that took place in the past, complete with names, places, and details. In order to understand what went on in a society without writing, we

must try to interpret matters from the artilacts they left behind—from their pottery, their art, and even their garbage.

A society that possesses writing is therefore historic. One that does not is prefistorie. In other words, history began with Sumeria about 3500 B.c.

is tedious to count those days, and the chances of mistakes are great.

There is a cycle of intermediate length, however, that of the phases of the  Moon. It takes 29 or 30 days for the Moon to go through its cycle of phases, and it takes 12 or 13 of these cycles (months, from the word Moon) to make up the cycle of the seasons.

We don’t know when people first began to attach importance to the months. There are indications that even prehistoric people counted them, but it was the people of the TigrisEuphrates region who first systematized the matter. They worked out a cycle of 19 years, in which certain years had 12 lunar months and others had 13 lunar months. Such a cycle kept the years even with the seasons. This lunar calendar was adopted by the Greeks and the Jews and is still used as the Jewish liturgical calendar.

The Egyptians, however, did not make use of the Moon primarily. To

them, the important [eature of the year was the periodic flooding of the Nile. The priests in charge of irrigation carefully studied the height of the river from day to day and eventually discovered that, on the average, the flood came every 365 days. That was also the time it took the Sun to make an apparent circuit of the sky relative to the stars. (In modern times, we view this as the time it takes the Earth to go around the Sun.) This is the solar year, and a calendar based on it is a solar calendar.

The Egyptians were aware that there were 12 new Moons to the year, so they had 12 months, but they made each month 30 days long, paying no attention to the actual phase of the Moon. That made 360 days, to which they added 5 more days at the end.

This calendar was

much simpler and handier than any other calendar invented in ancient times. Historians are uncertain of the date when it was first adopted, but priests may have been using it for their private computations (it obviously made them more powerful if they alone knew when the Nile would flood) as early as 2800 B.c.

Nothing better than the Egyptian calendar was devised for nearly three thousand years, and even then what was produced was a mere modification of it—and not all the changes were for the better. Our present calendar is still based on the Egyptian calendar, with changes that are, in some cases, also not for the better. This makes our calendar, in essence, nearly five thousand years old.

It was customary for the important citizens of the nation to build themselves elaborate burial tombs, since Egyptian religion dealt in detail with life after death, and it was felt that, to insure immortality, the body had to be preserved. The tombs were oblong objects called mastabas. (Nowadays, to insure the immortality of our presidents, we build colossal presidential libraries.)

periodically as modern skyscrapers sometimes are. Because these setbacks were like steps a giant would use in climbing to the top, the structure is called the Step Pyramid. The base is an oblong about 400 feet by 350 feet, and the top is almost 200 feet high.

The Step Pyramid was the first large stone structure ever built and is the oldest structure built by humans that remains substantially intact today.

The Step Pyramid set a fashion, and for a couple of centuries afterward the pharaohs kept the people busy in their spare time building more and more elaborate pyramids. Larger and larger stones were used, and the climax came when the Pharaoh Khufu (Cheops to the Greeks) supervised construction of the Great Pyramid, the largest of all, in about 2530 B.c.

When that pyramid was finished, its square base was 755 feet on each side, so that it covered an area of 13 acres. The four sides sloped upward evenly (for the notion of steps had

been abandoned) to a point 481 feet high. It was solidly composed of slabs of rock— 2,300,000 of them, it is estimated, with an average weight of 2'4 tons apiece. Each had to be brought some 600 miles, by water, of course, from quarries far up the Nile.

In among these rocky slabs were passages leading to a chamber near the center of the huge pile, which was to contain the king'’s coffin, his mummy, and his treasures after his death.

The fad for such large, vainglorious structures did not persist for long. They took too much time and too much work even for Egypt. The urge to build big objects, some useful, some symbolic, some vainglorious, has never left humanity, however. Some of the medieval cathedrals finally surpassed the pyramids in height (after 3,500 years or so) and today, of course, we have our skyscrapers, our huge bridges and dams, and so on.

With human beings, conflict reached new pitches of danger, thanks to intelligence. Human beings can remember past wrongs, brood upon them, and plot revenge. They can also, after victory, realize that the defeated parties may plot revenge, and therefore take further action to wipe them out completely. What's more, the advance of technology put weapons in human hands that made conflict ever bloodier. Sumeria was not as fortunately placed as Egypt was. The Tigris and Euphrates did not offer quite the same gentle watery highway that the Nile did. Communications were not as effective and there seemed less community of interests among the people of the region. The Sumerian city-states, with their wheeled carts and bronze weapons, fought each other more assiduously than the Egyptian city-states did. What's more, whereas Egypt was protected on both sides of the Nile by de-

sert, Sumeria was more open to invasion. The result was that non-Sumerian people settled on the upper reaches of the Tigris and Euphrates.

Just to the north of Sumeria, where the Euphrates and Tigris come closest together, cities were founded by Akkadians, who spoke a non-Sumerian language. The Akkadian language was of a type that came to be called Semitic. (The most important Semitic language extant today is Arabic.) The Sumerian language was not Semitic and, in fact, is not related to any other language we know of. There was even less community of interest between the Sumerian city-states and their Akkadian neighbors than between the Sumerian citystates themselves.

Thus it came about that, even seven centuries after Egypt had formed a nation, the city-states of the Tigris and Euphrates were unable to unite in peace. It was clear that the region would prosper best under unified rule, but there was no agreement as to which

city and which ruler should take over the leadership, and the matter had to be settled by force.

About 2350 B.c., a man named Sargon (ca. 2334— 2279 B.c.) took over the rule of Agade, one of the Akkadian cities. He was successful in war and established his rule over all of both Akkad and Sumeria. He also sent his armies northward and eastward and established his control over the upper reaches of the Tigris-Euphrates valley, a region that eventually came to be known as Assyria, and over the territory to the east of the Tigris, which was known as Elam.

While the Egyptian unification involved city-states of similar language and culture, Sargon ruled over peoples with different languages and cultures, his Akkadians being dominant over the others.

If one cultural group dominates others politically and militarily, the result is commonly referred to as an empire. Sargon established the first empire we know of. It was not, of course, the last.

-1800,Horses,"['Ammal', 'Armies']","['Iran', 'Mitanni', 'Iraq', 'Turkey']","Until now, the animals that had been used for pulling carts and ploughs were oxen and donkeys. The ox was strong, but it was lumbering, stupid, and slow. The donkey was more intelligent, but it was smaller and weaker than the ox. Neither could pull the heavy, solid-wheeled carts rapidly.

Ammal transport could not be used in warfare with any great success, therefore. Armies consisted of masses of foot soldiers, who slogged into each other, wielding spears and swords and cowering behind their shields, until one side or the other broke and ran. The carts could serve only as a ceremonial means of keeping the ruler and other military leaders from walking, or to carry arms and supplies.

But then, about 2000 B.C., a flect beast was tamed

—the wild horse—and not by any of the civilizations but by nomadic dwellers in the steppes of what we now call Iran, The horse was larger and stronger than the donkey, and faster and more intelligent than the ox. At first, though, it seemed useless for transport, for it was difficult to harness. A harness that was suitable for an ox placed pressure on the horse’s windpipe and cut its speed. Then, some time before 1800 B.c., someone devised a method of using the horse for specialized light traction. A cart was made as light as possible, becoming scarcely more than a small platform between two large wheels, a platform just large enough to hold a human being. Even the wheels were lightened, without loss of strength, by being made spoked rather than solid, and they were so fixed to the axle that they could turn individu-

ally. The result was a chariot (a word not too different from cart).

A horse, or horses, pulling so light a load could run fleetly, much faster than a foot soldier could. With only two wheels, the chariot was almost as maneuverable as the horse itself and could skid into a new direction with little trouble.

1t did not take long for the nomads to discover that a body of charioteers, driving in fiercely, could not be stopped by the foot soldiers of the day, Indeed, foot soldiers broke and fled in horror at the first sight of the animals thundering toward them.

This is the first clear case we have of a new war weapon catching those without it by surprise and bestowing a kind of universal victory on those who had it. The raiding nomads ripped into the TigrisEuphrates valley, which

came under “barbarian rule” for a period of time. The nomads established the kingdom of Mitanni in

It is certainly difficult to believe that the pyramids, for instance, could have been built without substantial ability in geometry.

The Sumerians, and the Babylonians who succeeded them, were the first to make significant advances in mathematics and in astronomy. By 1800 B.c., they had developed a number system based on 60 that we still follow in some

1700 B.c., the horsemen drove down into Canaan and then even into Egypt, which fell to alien invaders for the first time, and also into India.

Such invasions spread devastation in the settled

ways, since we still have 60 seconds to the minute and 60 minutes to the hour. Why 60? Because it can be evenly divided by 2, 3,4, 5, 6,10, 12, 15, and 30, thus eliminating the frequent need of fractions—with which the ancients had trouble.

In addition, there are 360 degrees (6 x 60) in the circle. Again, it is a number easily divided. In addition, the Sun takes 365 days to move completely around the sky, so that it travels, relative to the stars, just about 1 degree per day. That too may have influenced the choice of 360.

The sky-watchers of the Tigris-Euphrates valley eventually discovered that,

areas, but they did tend to stir things up. They helped change ways of life that

had perhaps become somewhat decadent, and encouraged the flow of new ideas from one settled place to another.

in addition to the Sun and Moon, five bright stars changed position against the remaining “fixed” stars. These moving stars, which we call planets (from a Greek word for “wandering"""") were given the names of gods and goddesses, and we still do that today. We call the five bright stars Mercury, Venus, Mars, Jupiter, and Saturn. The presence of seven such planets (if we include the Sun and the Moon) gave rise to the seven-day week, with one of the planets in charge of each day. The week as a unit of time was thus instituted by the Babylonians and was adopted first by the Jews, then by the Christians, and through them, by

virtually all the modern world.

The seven planets had paths around the sky, paths that passed through certain conglomerations of stars that were termed, in total, the zodiac by the later Greeks. This was divided into twelve constellations, so that the Sun remained in each constellation for about a month. Eventually the Sumerians and Babylonians worked out the pathways in some detail and could predict, in at least a rough manner, where the planets would be at future times. That represented the beginning of mathematical astronomy.

Since the Sun affected the Earth profoundly, making the difference between the day and night, and the Moon's phases marked the length of the month, it seemed natural to suppose that the other planets also had significance to human beings. Imaginative suggestions were made about the influence of each, as it varied in position with respect to the stars and other planets, and an intricate system of foretelling the future from planetary positions

was evolved. This is astrology.

Astrology is utter nonsense, but people strongly want the security of knowing the future, so that even today astrology is accepted by many people who are uneducated, unsophisticated, or simply silly.

-1775,Fermentation,[],['Fruit'],"Fruit juices that are left standing will sometimes ferment; that is, undergo changes that alter the taste. The same is true of moistened grain. Human beings, driven by thirst or hunger, might consume such fermented materials and then find that they liked the taste and the aftereffects. They were, of course, consuming alcohol, formed from sugars and starches by yeast, and they would grow elated as a result, because somewhat intoxicated. (This is not an exclusively human trait. Birds and animals will sometimes greedily feed on fermented fruits and become obviously intoxicated too.)

This may have happened in prehistoric times,

but by 1800 B.c. the use of fermented materials was so common that laws had to be passed directing what was to be done in the case of misdeeds committed under the influence of too much beer.

From the¢ beginning of agriculture, grain was converted into lour, which was moistencd and made into flat, hard, but nourishing bread. Every once ina while, though, the moistened dough fermented and released gases (carbon dioxide) that caused the bread to rise and grow spongy. The result was leavened bread (from a Latin word meaning “to rise’), which was just as nutritious as flat bread but softer and much more pleasant to eat.

The Egyptians discovered this not long after 1800 B.c. and eventually learned that the process could be controlled. If some of the fermenting bread was saved before it was baked and added to dough that had not yet begun to ferment, the fresh dough would ferment in its turn. One would not have to depend on chance.

In a simple society, custom is, in fact, enough. Everyone knows what behavior is expected, and conforms almost automatically. If not, there is social ostracism, and this is sufficiently undesirable to enforce the rule of custom.

As a society grows more complex, however, there are more varieties of behavior that must be controlled and regulated, more perplexing conditions, more complicated questions, more puzzling interactions. It becomes difficult to remember all the rules, and the suspicion is sure to arise that powerful people make up or alter rules to suit themselves. The demand, then, is for the rules of society to be put in writing, so that all can see for

themselves what they are, and so that they cannot be unfairly or arbitrarily twisted or modified.

We don't know when the first laws were written down, but the first relatively complete law code that we still have was established by Hammurabi, king of Babylon (reigned 1792— 1750 B.c.), who founded a rather short-lived Babylonian Empire in the TigrisEuphrates valley, one that succeeded the Akkadian Empire. (After this time, the people of the valley were referred to as Babylonians for nearly two millennia.)

Perhaps about 1775 B.C., Hammurabi had his law code inscribed on an 8-foot-high stone pillar of hard diorite. It was clearly intended to be permanent, and it was, for we still have it

The stele is topped by a relief that shows Hammurabi standing before the Sun-god, Shamash. (It was usual in ancient times to

suppose that a law code was received by a king from a god. That tended to lend the law authority. Thus, Moses received the Jewish law code from God on Mount Sinai, according to the Bible.)

Down along the face of the stele are twenty-one columns of finely written cuneiform, outlining nearly three hundred laws that were to govern people’s actions and guide the king and his officials in dispensing justice.

The stele originally stood in the town of Sippar, some 30 miles upstream from Babylon, but an invading Elamite force plundered the city and carried away the stele as spoil. It remained in Elam’s capital, Susa, thereafter and was still there, in Susa’s ruins, in 1901, when a French archaeologist, Jacques Jean Marie de Morgan (1857— 1924), found it and brought it back to Europe.

The Old Stone Age artists used colored earths to make their paintings.

As early as 3000 B.c., dyes were used to color otherwise white or yellowish cloth, both in Egypt and in China. Indigo, a blue color extracted from a plant, was used and madder, a red color extracted from the root of another plant. By

1400 B.¢., cloth could be dyed in virtually all colors.

The chief trouble with most early dyes was that thev tended to bleach in the sun and to wash out in water, so that dyed fabrics quickly grew dim and blurred.

One dye that was very resistant both to sun and water was obtained from a snail in the eastern Mediterranean. To obtain the dye was a tedious task, but the resultant red-purple color was brilliant and srayed brilliant. The city of Tyre in Phoenicia had developed this dye industry by 1200

B.C. so that the color was called Tyrian purple. Between the difficulty of amassing a quantity of it, and its great desirability, its price went sky-high, but it still sold, albeit only to the rich and powerful. Tyre grew wealthy out of its dye trade and was able to support its merchant fleet and undertake trading ventures that made it richer still.

When they did venture out to sea, they generally hugged the coast. Even the Cretans, the boldest seagoers up to this time, had confined themselves to the eastern Mediterranean and felt safest in the Aegean Sea, where numerous islands made possible short sails from land to land.

Greek legends treated distant portions of the sea as places of myth and mystery. The tale of Jason and the Argonauts reflects early ventures into the large and island-free Black Sea. Homer's Odyssey describes the adventures of Odysseus in the even larger western Mediterranean.

The first to cast out boldly into the open sea were the Phoenicians. They noted that the seven stars that made up the familiar grouping of the Big Dipper were always located to the north and were visible all night long at every season of the year (barring the presence of clouds). This must surely have been known for a long time, but the Phoenicians seem to have been the first who were willing to risk their ships and lives on the fact. By observing the Big Dipper, they knew always which direction was north, and from that they knew all other directions. This obviated the fear of being lost once out of sight of land and “landmarks.""” There were always the “skymarks,” so to speak.

In addition, the Phoeni-

cians refused to depend on sails and wind alone. The wind was erratic, after all, so the Phoenicians used oars, which the Egyptians had been using on the Nile for twenty centuries. Oared ships (galleys) now ruled the Mediterranean for twenty-six centuries.

Using oars, and keeping the Big Dipper on the right, the Phoenician ship captains could sail boldly westward, knowing they could return by remembering to keep the Big Dipper on the left. Beginning about 1100 B.c. then, the Phoenicians explored the coasts of northern Africa west of Egypt and southern Europe west of Greece, trading and in some cases settling.

Such meteorites were occasionally found by the ancients and used even in the earliest days of civilization. Compared to gold, silver, and copper, iron is an ugly metal, but the meteoric iron that was found revealed itself to be harder and tougher even than bronze. Since it held its edge far better than bronze did, it was much in demand for edged portions of tools.

The result is that no iron meteorite from the

past is ever found where the earliest civilizations lourished. The ancients scavenged them all.

Yet ores did not yield iron. Gold, silver, copper, lead, tin, and eventually mercury were obtained with ease by use of wood fires, but such fires never yielded iron. Iron held on to other substances more tightly than the other metals did, and a higher temperature was needed.

Eventually, though charcoal was obtained by burning wood with an insufficient supply of air so that more-or-less pure car bon was left behind when other substances burned away. Charcoal burns flamelessly but reaches higher temperatures than wood does.

An eclipse is a frightening spectacle. Those who become aware of it may actually think that the Sun or the Moon is dying, with incalculable consequences.

Whole numbers and fractions together make up the rational numbers (those that can be expressed as ratios), and it is easy Lo suppose that ratio-

However, suppose you have a right triangle with each side equal to 1 unit. What is the length of the hypotenuse? The answer can be obtained by remembering that the square of the hypotenuse is equal to the sum of the squares of the sides. This was long known, but Pythagoras worked out a good proof and it is called the Pythagorean theorem as aresult.

The square of each side is 1, so the square of the hypotenuse is 2, and the length of the hypotenuse is the square root of 2, or that

It certainly looked that way, and why should the evidence of one's eyes be denied?

Nevertheless, the Greek philosopher Philolaus (5th century B.c.), a student of Pythagoras (see 520 B.c.), felt that the Earth, with all the visible planets including the Sun, rotated about a central fire, which could not be seen. He was the first person we know of to suggest that the Earth moved and was not at the center of the Universe, but his suggestion was more mystical than rational and it won little credence.

The Greek astronomer Heracleides Ponticus (ca. 390-after 322 B.c.) did not

go so far. He felt the Earth was the immovable center of the Universe, but he pointed out, about 350 B.c., that Mercury and Venus were never very far from the Sun. This could be accounted for by schemes the Greeks worked out that had each planet circling independently about the Earth, but to do so was difficult. Heracleides maintained that it was much simpler to suppose that Mercury and Venus circled the Sun, and that the Sun, with these two subsidiary bodies in attendance, circled the Earth. He was the first to suggest that there was at least some heliocentrism to the Universe, that at least some bodies revolved about the Sun and only secondarily about the Earth.

. Logic Everyone reasons after a fashion. It is impossible not

to. Primordial hunters would reason from foot-

prints that an animal had passed that way and would identify it from the nature of the markings. Everything you do, if you are in a normal state of mind, has some reason behind it. Unfortunately, however, there are innumerable ways of reasoning in a faulty manner, and reasoning in general can be swayed by emotions, by self-interest, and so on. The result is that people frequently, and under some circumstances almost always, behave in an irrational manner.

Aristotle (see 387 B.c.) was the first thinker we know of who undertook to work out a legitimate system of reasoning (logie, from the Greek for “word""). His book Organon developed the study of logic in great and satisfying detail, describing the art of reasoning from premise to necessary conclusion and thereby demonstrating how to establish the validity of a line of thought.

The first person we know of who seems to have suggested that the Earth was not flat but spherical was Pythagoras (see 520 B.c.). It was Aristotle (see 387 B.c.), however, who summarized the reasons, possibly about 350 B.c., reasons that still hold today.

As one moves north, stars rise above the northern horizon and sink below the southern horizon, while as one moves south, the reverse happens. The shadow of the Earth on the Moon during a lunar eclipse is always a circular arc. When ships sail away from you at sea, the hull always seems to disappear before the superstructure, and this happens in the same way in any direction. All these indicate the Earth to be spherical.

These arguments were accepted by educated people even at low points in intellectual history, yet there are people today, with an education of sorts, who cling to something equivalent to a Flat-Earth Society. This, of all antiscience

movements, secems the most indefensible, and one suspects that they are either joking or just a little mad.

-387,Five Elements,['Aristotle'],"['Aristotle', 'Aristotle Greek', 'Earth', 'Earth Latin']","Aristotle (see 387 B.c.) also summarized earlier thoughts on the elements of which the world was composed. Thales (see 580 B.c.) had suggested that it was composed of water, while later philosophers had named other candidates.

Aristotle suggested that it was made of four elements—earth, water, air, and fire—and that it was built in consecutive shells. At the center was a ball of earth, surrounded by a ball of water (through which some earth protruded in places). This was in turn surrounded by a ball of air, and then, still farther out, by a ball of fire (sometimes visible as lightning).

The heavens themselves, however, were fundamentally different from the world, in Aristotle’s view, and were made up of a fifth element, which he called aether (from a Greek word meaning “blazing""’). After all, the heavenly bodies were all luminous, while the world was dark, except when it rellected light. The heavenly bodies moved in endless circles, while on

Earth bodies fell or rose. The heavenly bodies were unchanging and incorruptible, while on Earth everything changed and deteriorated.,

This view of Aristotle’s turned out to be wrong, but to this day we still speak of “hghting the elements” when we face wind and rain, and when we want to say that something is the pure and abstract representation of anything we call it a quintessence, from Latin words meaning “fifth element.”’

He was particularly interested in sea life. He observed that the dolphin brought forth its young alive, nourishing its voung by a special organ called a placenta before birth and by milk after it was born. No fish did this, but all  mammals did, so Aristotle classified the dolphin with the beasts of the field rather than with the fish of the sea. It took biologists generally about two thousand years to catch up with Aristotle in this regard. Classification is important in itself, for it helps to organize a field of study. In the case of biology it was

particularly important, for it led eventually to thoughts of biological evolution.

That meant that everywhere roads, reasonably wide, reasonably straight, and reasonably smooth, had to be built. This Rome understood.

In the years after its humiliation by the Gauls, Rome had perfected the legion, which was a much more flexible formation than the phalanx. The pha-

lanx could only fight in close order, and any unevenness in the ground would upset that order. The legion, on the other hand, could disperse on uneven ground without falling into disarray and could come together again when conditions allowed.

In 312 B.c. Appius Claudius (4th—3rd century B.C.), a high Roman official, initiated the building of the Appian Way, the best road the world had yet seen. It extended from Rome to Capua, a distance of 132 miles. At first it was covered by gravel, but eventu-

ally it was paved with blocks of stone and extended to the heel of Italy.

The road allowed for the rapid movement of troops and gave Rome an enormous advantage in bringing up reinforcements or achieving surprise. Eventually Rome would build 50,000 miles of roads throughout its dominions. Some were over 30 feet wide. This meant that Roman armies could be hurried from one border to another at quick step, and relatively small forces could protect its boundaries.

The Greeks made it theoretical, however, working with ideal points, lines, curves, planes, and solids. They attempted to prove things by reason alone and without actual measurement. (Reason was the mark of the philosopher; measurement was only for the artisan, and the Greek scholars were snobs. Snobbery turned out to be useful in mathematics, though not in experimental science, where the Greeks fell badly short.)

A number of Greek mathematicians contributed to the development of geometry, particularly Eudoxus (see 350 B.c., Star Maps). It was Euclid (fl. ea. 300 B.c.) who brought geometry to maturity, however. He worked in Alexandria, Egypt, and thereby hangs a tale.

The city of Alexandria, on the seacoast at the westernmost branch of the Nile delta, had been founded by

Alexander III (see 320 B.c.) and named after himself. It was a largely Greek city, though it contained many Egyptians and Jews as well. It quickly became the largest and most cosmopolitan city of the Greek world. Ptolemy I (ca. 366—ca. 283 B.c.), who ruled over Egypt after Alexander’s death, established his capital at Alexandria.

Ptolemy I saw himself as a patron of the arts and sciences and founded the Museum, so-called because it was an institution devoted to the Muses, the patron goddesses of learning. He and his son, Ptolemy II (308-246 B.c.), made the Museum the largest and most important of all the ancient universities. Associated with it was the largest of all the ancient libraries.

The Prolemies encouraged scientists and thinkers generally to come to Alexandria and subsidized them well. Euclid, a Greek mathematician who may have studied at the Academy, moved from Athens to Alexandria as a result, symbolizing the ""brain drain’ that followed, as Greeks poured out of Greece proper into the new dominions of the

Hellenistic kingdoms that succeeded Alexandria.

Perhaps about 300 B.c., Euclid began compiling all the geometrical [indings of earlier mathematicians into a textbook eventually called Elements. He added comparatively little himself, but what he did was beyond price.

He began with a minimum number of statements that were so self-cvident that they required no proof. From these axioms, he proceeded systematically to prove theorem after theorem, each prool depending only on the axioms and on previous proofs, so that geometry was given a firm foundation and structure.

It was the most suceessful textbook ever written and has been used, in more or less modified form, to this day.

After all, the stars are just specks of light on the vault of a sky that looks as though it barely clears Earth’s high mountains. The Sun and Moon have visible orbs, but they seem small too. To suggest otherwise would certainly have been considered foolish, or worse.

Thus, when the Greek philosopher Anaxagoras (ca, 500—ca. 428 B.C.) suggested that the Sun was a rock the size of southern Greece, he horrified the Athenian conservatives, who accused him of irreligion, brought him to trial, and forced him into exile.

Two centuries had passed since then, and the Greek world had expanded

enormously. With its horizons broadened, daring thoughts were better tolerated, and the Greek astronomer Aristarchus (fl. ca. 270 B.c.) was the first to try to determine the size of the heavenly bodies.

About 280 B.c., he noted the size of the shadow cast by Earth on the Moon and, following a correct line of mathematical argument, estimated that the Moon was a body with a diameter one-third that of the Earth. His result was a little high because he lacked the instruments with which to measure the shadow accurately.

Aristarchus also tried to determine the relative size of the Moon and the Sun by trigonometry. He noted that at the time the Moon was in its half-phase, the Moon, Sun, and Earth were at the apexes of a right triangle. Thus, if the angles were measured, the lengths of the sides could be calculated. Aristarchus’s mathematics was correct but again he was victimized by the lack of instruments with which to make accurate measurements, He ended by deciding that the Sun was twenty times as far from the Earth as the Moon was and that the Sun had therefore seven times the diameter of the Earth. This turned out to be a

gross underestimate, but Aristarchus was nevertheless the first to show, by scientific reasoning, that the heavenly bodies were objects comparable to the Earth in size.

A consideration of the Sun'’s huge size possibly led Aristarchus to maintain that the Sun, and not the Earth, was the center of the Universe, and that the various planets, including the Earth, revolved about the Sun. He had no evidence for this, and the notion did not convince anyone. Even if the Sun were a huge body, it was considered an insubstantial ball of light, and the thought of the solid, heavy Earth revolving around it seemed ridiculous.

That statue was 105 feet high and was completed in 280 B.c.

About 270 B.c., a Greek inventor, Ctesibius (2d century B.c.), devised a model of the water clock that gained great popularity. It included a float in the water, which rose as the

Water clocks could tell time well enough to govern the length of time a person might talk in court or before an assembly, but they were nevertheless crude timepieces at best.

-260,Lever,"['Archimedes', 'Archimedes Eureka']","['Greek', 'Eureka', 'Greeks']","Levers were used in prehistoric times. It is no great trick for a lively mind to try to pry up a rock with a long stick and to find that it works better if another, smaller rock is placed under the stick to give the stick something to push against. It would then quickly be discovered that the closer the small rock is to the big rock being pried up, the easier the prying gets.

Nevertheless, the precise mathematics of lever action was not worked out until the Greek scientist Archimedes (ca. 287-212 B.c.) did it about 260 B.c.

You might say, “Whal difference does it make that scholars worked out lancy theories and mathematics for levers, when practical people had been actually

using such devices for thousands of years?""

The point is that use without theory is largely hit and miss. Advances are made, yes, but slowly. Once a useful theory is worked out, however, it is like removing a blindfold. It becomes obvious how a device might be improved, or what new observations need to be made. With a theory, advances speed up enormously.

Therefore we give Archimedes credit for the principle of the lever, regardless of how long the lever had been in use before his time.

Archimedes also worked oul the principle of buoyancy, the manner in which any object immersed in a fluid displaces a volume of fluid equal 1o its own volume. This provided

a way of measuring volume, a way of explaining why some things (loat and some don't, and so on. Archimedes grasped the principle quite suddenly when he lowered himself into a public bath and noticed the water overflow.

The storv is that he sprang out of the bath and raced home nude, shouting “Eureka! Eureka!” (“I have it! [ have it!""). He had been given the problem of checking whether a golden crown was adulterated with a less dense metal or not, without damaging the crown. For that he had 1o know the valume, and the buovaney elfect would give it to him.

It was bound to be huge, since no traveler had ever been totally around it. There was always more Earth, unknown and as yet unvisited, up ahead.

But then a Greek scholar, Eratosthenes (ca. 276—ca. 194 B.Cc.), working at Alexandria, found a way to measure the Earth'’s circumference without leaving Egypt. At the summer solstice, he had been told, the Sun at noon cast no shadow at the city of Syene (modern Aswan), which was far south of Alexandria. That meant that the Sun was then directly overhead at Syene. At the same time, though, the Sun was

7 degrees from the zenith in Alexandria. This difference had to result from the fact that the Earth curved between Syene and Alexandria. Knowing the northsouth distance from Syene to Alexandria, Eratosthenes could use mathematics to calculate how far it would take the curvature of the Earth, worked out between Syene and Alexandria, to take him all the way around the Earth.

He came out with a length of 25,000 miles for Earth’s circumference. He was correct.

The ancients, however, thought his figure was too high and preferred to accept a lower one.

Eratosthenes (see above) was the first person to try to make sense out of chronology and to match one system with another. He did his best to stretch dating back to the time of the Trojan War.

This wall was begun in 214 B.c. Initially it was of earth, but later it was made of brick. It eventually extended for 1,500 miles, from the Pacific Ocean to a point deep in central Asia.

when the small Hellenistic kingdom of Pergamum in western Asia Minor, under Eumenes 11, who ruled from 197 to somewhere around 160 B.c., wished to build a library that would rival the one at Alexandria, naturally the Ptolemies would not cooperate by shipping the necessary papyrus.

Hides had often been used as writing material, but the Pergamese learned to stretch them, scrape them, and clean them, so that they ended with a thin white sheet that could be covered with writing on both sides. In later times, it came to be called parch-

You can’t measure the distance between two heavenly bodies by holding a yardstick against the sky. You can only measure the angle you must turn your head in looking first at one, then at the other.

If you make the angle

The Greek astronomer Hipparchus (fl. 146—127 B.C.), usually considered the greatest of ancient astronomers, was the first to make up careful tables relating angles to side ratios, so that if you knew the angle, you

could look up the ratios, and vice versa. For this reason, Hipparchus is usually considered the founder of trigonometry.

Hipparchus used trigonometry to calculate the distance from the Earth to the Moon. First he noted the Moon's position against the stars from different positions on Earth, because when your point of view changes, a relatively near object seems to change posi

tion in comparison to a relatively distant one; this is called parallax. The smaller the shift with a fixed change of position, the greater the distance to the nearer object. Once he had measured the parallax of the Moon, he could determine by trigonometry the distance of the Moon, at least in terms of the Earth's size. In this way Hipparchus calculated

Hipparchus determined to prepare a star

If, as Eratosthenes had determined, Earth had a circumference of 25,000 miles, it had to have a diameter of 8,000 miles. That meant that the Moon was 30 x 8,000 miles, or 240,000 miles away (which is very nearly correct).

In order to make his map, he plotted the position of each star according to its latitude and longitude, as Eudoxus had done (see 350 B.C., Star Maps). Hipparchus included over a thousand stars, and both in quantity and in accuracy it was a far better map than anything attempted before. What's more, it occurred to

This was the first indication that the Universe was far larger than had been thought, but it was also a dead end. Parallaxes grow smaller as objects grow more distant, and the Moon is the only object close enough to give a measurable parallax to the unaided eye.

The Middle Ages (476—1453)

Technological advances continued to be made in the Middle Ages. Yet the light of pure scientific inquiry dimmed considerably, especially during the first five centuries of the period, which are often referred to as a Dark Age. This was an intensely theological age, marked by ambivalence about science when its findings seemed to go against religious teaching. A later resurgence of interest in theoretical science was dampened by the Black Death, a devastating epidemic of bubonic plague. In the early seventh century, the center of scientific activity shifted to the East, as invading Muslims took control of the Hellenistic cities that were repositories of Greek learning. Arab scholars eagerly absorbed the knowledge in the old texts, and they did impressive new work in astronomy, optics, medicine, and alchemy, the predecessor of modern chemistry. Toward the end of the Middle Ages, the ancient learning that

the Arabs had collected and expanded upon came back to Europe. For most of the Middle Ages, astronomy was ignored in the West. Several new stars were detected by Chinese astronomers, but no one in Europe noticed them. Porcelain and the production of silk were imported from China; other innovations that may have been developed independently in Europe already existed in China, The Chinese apparently had long known about the direction-finding properties of magnetic ore but didn't use it for navigation. When Western navigators first did so in 1180, they created in the compass a tool that— because of the subsequent explorations and European domination of other cultures—helped determine the course of history. While the Vikings had made earlier impressive oceangoing forays, the Age of Exploration is usually defined as beginning in the early fifteenth century, when the Portuguese sent out ships

that sought a sea route to the Far East. Thus began what would become a stampede of world exploration by the European powers. Perhaps the most dramatic technological achievement of the late Middle Ages, one in which technology served both religion and art, was the building of the great cathedrals. Flying buttresses allowed walls to be higher and thinner than ever before, and church interiors were transformed, suffused with light that shone through glorious stained glass windows. In the thirteenth and fourteenth centuries there were stirrings of renewed interest in scientific inquiry. Planetary tables formulated under the patronage of the king of Castile improved on those of Ptolemy, and experimental work on the magnetic poles constituted a breakthrough in scientific methodology. Medical students again performed dissections of the human body, and the first book devoted to anatomy was published.

However, it wasn't an event in theoretical science or medicine that took Europe out of the Middle Ages and

into the Renaissance and the Scientific Revolution Credit for that goes largely

During the time of the Roman Empire, silk reached the Western world over the Silk Road, which ran the width of Asia. With every tribe en route charging to let the silk through,

it arrived in Rome worth its weight in gold. Since the Roman aristocracy insisted on silk and on other exotic luxuries from the East, however, the trade balance was heavily against

Rome, and this undoubtedly contributed to its decay.

Then a neo-Persian Empire was formed, which was so hostile to the Romans that silk was not al-

lowed to pass through at all.

Justinian (see 537) therefore arranged to have two Persian monks who had lived in China go there and bring back silkworm eggs secreted in hollow bamboo canes. In 552 Constantinople began silk production itself, and from that time to this the West has had its own silk.

slave may have come from Slav because they seemed so easily enslaved.) Nevertheless, they endured and multiplied and contributed an important advance. About 600, they are supposed to have invented the moldboard plow. This had a knife blade, or cotilter, that cut deep into the ground, a plowshare that cut grass and stubble

at ground level, and a shaped moldboard above the plowshare that lifted and turned the soil, This was a useful device for damp, moist ground. It wasn't needed in the light Mediterranean soil, but as it slowly spread through eastern and northern Europe, food production took a jump and population grew.

Whereas Greek learning had been almost forgotten in western Europe, the Arabs preserved it and translated the great books of Euclid, Aristotle, Ptolemy, and others into Arabic. For several centuries the Arabs were the leading scientists of the Western

world, excelling in astronomy, medicine, and alchemy.

The greatest of the Arabian alchemists was Jabir ibn Hayyan (ca. 721—ca. 815), known to Europeans later as Geber. He sought for methods of forming gold, and also for some mysterious dry powder (elixir, from Arabic words meaning “‘the dry one"") that would do the job. It was thought that such a magical substance could also cure all disease, and it was known as the elixir of life or

the panacea (from Greek words meaning “all-healing""""). Centuries of effort went into a useless search for this substance.

Geber, however, in his researches, also managed to make important discoveries. Up to his time, the strongest acid known was vinegar, a dilute solution of acetic acid. By distilling vinegar, Geber obtained purer samples of acetic acid, which were, naturally, stronger than vinegar. This was important, for until then the one agent

850,Zero,"['Arab', 'Muhammad', 'Arabic']","['Greeks', 'Indian', 'English', 'Europe']","Human beings had been manipulating numbers ever since they had begun writing, about twenty-three centuries earlier. In general, there would be a tendency to make score marks for units, so that 4 would be /// /. Different marks would be introduced for fives, tens, and fifties, to avoid having to make too many score marks. Or else, as in the case of the Jews and Greeks, letters of the alphabet would be used (which introduced nonsignificant connections between words and numbers and introduced the superstitious folly of numerology). It might have occurred to someone to use the same numbers for units, tens, hundreds, and so on, merely placing the numbers in different positions

for each level, as on an abacus (see 500 B.c.). No one tried this positional notation, however, because no one thought of using a symbol for an abacus level in which no beads had been moved

For example, if you want to indicate 507 on an abacus, you move 5 beads at the hundreds level and 7 at the units level. You can record the 5 and the 7, but how do you indicate that the tens level hasn't been touched?

About the year 500, some Indian mathematician suggested that such an untouched abacus level be given a special symbol. (Our symbol is 0 and we call it zero.) This meant that you could no longer confuse 507 with 57 or 570. The Arabs may have picked it up from the Hindus about the year 700.

The first important mathematician to make use of this positional notation was an Arab, Muhammad ibn Al-Khwarizmi (780— 850), who wrote a book featuring it about 810. (In the book he coined a term that in English became algebra.)

The new system slowly penetrated Europe, which took centuries to give up its clumsy Roman numerals and take up the new Arabic numerals (although, of course, the numerals were Indian to start with). It took centuries to overcome the habit of sticking to something inconvenient but customary rather than adopting something good but new. Still, it was done in the end, and the transition democratized arithmetical computation, bringing it within reach of everyone.

The Muslims were not allowed to drink wine and didn’t know about tea. Naturally, they would be on the watch for something.

Coffee may have originally grown wild in Ethiopia in the province of Kalffe and been brought to southern Arabia. There, in 850, according to tradition, a

goatherd noticed that his goats acted frisky after eating berries of the plant. He tried it himself, liked the sensation, and told others. In time, people learned how to roast the beans obtained from the berries, steep them in boiling water, and produce coftee. Centuries later, coffee was introduced to western Europe.

In France, sometime about 1050, machinery was brought into play: the bow was drawn back by a twohanded crank or the equivalent. Eventually the bows were made of steel, and a short bolt was shot out that had a range of about 1,000 feet and could penetrate chain mail.

This was the first mechanized hand weapon, and the bolt it shot forth seemed so terrifying that the weapon seemed too horrible to use. At least a

Church council of 1139 tried to ban its use except against non-Christians. (The ban didn't work.)

The chief disadvantage of the crossbow was its slowness. It took a long time to crank it up and make ready to shoot and once it was fired, the enemy might easily swoop down before it could be cocked again. (Hence the expression “to have shot their bolt,” meaning to have taken action and to be helpless thereafter.)

At its peak, it was two or three times as bright as Venus at its brightest and could cast a dim shadow. It remained visible for nearly two years before finally fading away into invisibility.

This new star was recorded by the Chinese astronomers, but in Europe it went unnoted (or at least no reference to it has survived). This is an indication of the low state of astronomy, and of science generally, in Europe, which was just then emerging from a five-century-long Dark Age.

was that the Romanesque churches of earlier centuries bore a predominant atmosphere of squat gloom. In the twelfth century, however, the notion arose of designing large structures in such a way as to concentrate the weight of the roof in certain areas where outside buttresses of masonry could be built. For further strength, buttresses that stood well away from the building could be connected to the key points

needing support by diagonal structures, called flying buttresses.

Since the buttresses carried the weight, those sections of the walls not directly involved in support could be left thin and pierced with numerous windows. When the windows were filled with stained glass, the interior of the structure would be drenched with colored light in a beautiful and impressive manner.

The phenomenon was first studied by Thales (see 585 B.c.). It was eventually found that stroking with the magnetic ore could turn a sliver of iron or steel into a magnet.

Somehow it was discovered that if a magnetic sliver was allowed to turn freely, it would come to rest pointing in a north-south direction. We don't know how this fact was discovered, but the Chinese were the first to be aware of it. It is referred to in Chinese books dating as far back as the second century.

The Chinese never used the magnet for directionfinding in navigation, because by and large they were not great navigators, The Arabs may have learned of it from them, however, and perhaps some Crusaders learned of it from the Arabs.

In 1180 the English scholar Alexander Neckam (1157-1217) was the first European to make reference to this directional ability of magnetism. As soon as the Europeans heard of it, they began to try to put it to use as a navigation aid, and they began to improve it. Eventually a magnetic needle was put on a card marked with various directions, and because the needle was free to move all

around the card, it was referred to as a magnetic compass (from a French word meaning “to go around”’). If a single point in time can be picked as the moment when Europe first took the road that was to lead to world dominion, it was the moment when Europeans heard of the magnetic compass and put it to use. With the compass, Europeans could eventually go wherever they wished over the wide oceans, so that they eventually dominated the whole world as no other relatively small group of people had ever done before or (in all likelihood) will ever do again.

In 1260 two brothers, Nicolo and Maffeo Polo, well-to-do Venetian merchants, made their first trading trip eastward. In 1275 they returned to northern China, where Kublai Khan maintained his capital, and this time they brought Nicolo’s son, Marco Polo (1254-1324). Marco stayed in China for twenty years, was in high favor most of the time, and had an opportunity to study the land, the people, and the customs. He found a nation far in advance of Europe in population, in wealth, in technology,

and in all the civilized amenities.

He didn’t return to Venice till 1295. Then, caught up in a war between Venice and Genoa, he was taken prisoner and, while in

o o

prison, began to dictate his reminiscences of China. The book was published in 1298 and was immensely popular, but it was largely disbelieved.

It did create an impres-

sion of the “gorgeous East,”

however, so that the Far East became a wonder-goal for European dreamers, with important consequences for the future.

1298,Spinning Wheels,[],"['India', 'Europe']","For thousands of years, fibers had been spun into thread by the action of the hand: the fiber was held on a distaff and was twisted into yarn by turning a spindle. It was a slow, painstaking process that thoroughly occupied much of the time of the females of a household. (It was “women’s work"" par excellence, and the females of a family are still referred to jocularly as “the distaff side.”)

In India the process had eventually been mechanized: a foot-powered treadle turned a large wheel that twisted the spindle. Such a spinning wheel greatly hastened the work of spinning thread out of fiber. About 1298 the spinning wheel made its way into Europe.

The wheel and the spindle were connected by a belt, the first example of a belt drive in machinery. The spinning wheel was also one of the first important mechanical means of lightening women's work.

It was more than 6 feet long and fired arrows that were 3 feet long. A skilled longbow archer could shoot an arrow accurately for 250 yards and reach an extreme range of 350 yards. This was twice the range of the aver-

age crossbow (see 1050), and much more important, while the crossbow was being cranked up once, the longbow could be fired five or six times. If equal numbers of archers with longbows and crossbows were

to encounter each other, the crossbow archers would be riddled.

The disadvantage of the longbow, however, was that the archer had to exert a force of 90 to 100 pounds to draw the bow and to

maintain that pull evenly until the feather of the arrow was aligned with the sar, Tk

1304,Distilled Liquor,['Arnau'],"['Spanish', 'Villanova']","Natural fermentation has its limits. As fruit or other materials ferment, alcohol accumulates and eventu-

ally grows sufficiently concentrated to kill the yeasts or other microorganisms that were producing the fermentation.

The alchemists had learned how to distill: how to heat a substance and drive off the volatile materials, which could condense into liquid elsewhere, leaving behind dissolved matter, Thus, if sea water 1s heated, the vapors consist only of water, and if cooled, this is drinkable. The salt is left behind and has its own uses.

Eventually, alcoholic beverages were distilled. Since alcohol boils at a lower temperature than water does, the initial va-

pors of the beverage are higher in alcohol than the original liquid. If the vapors are then cooled and condensed, the result is a stronger liquor with a good deal more of a “kick” than the original has.

In 1300 the Spanish alchemist Arnau de Villanova (ca. 1235-1312) distilled wine and obtained reasonably pure alcohol for the first time. In the process, of course, he prepared brandy, which is distilled wine with a much higher alcohol content than ordinary wine. Not only brandy, but whiskey (made by distilling fermenting grain) became available in sizable quantities.

Till then, and for a considerable time afterward, those who drew comets let their panic be their guide and presented the silliest pictures imaginable. In 1304, however, Giotto

painted The Adoration of the Magi, in which he pictured the star of Bethlehem as a comet, and seems to have let the comet of 1301 guide his brush. Giotto’s is the first realistic depiction of a comet.

If by then they had not developed the disease and died, they could be considered not to have it and would be allowed to enter.

The waiting time was

eventually standardized at forty days (perhaps because forty-day periods play an important role in the Bible). For that reason, the waiting period was called quarantine, from the French word for “forty.”

In a society that knew no other way of fighting disease, quarantine was better than nothing. It was the first measure of public hygiene deliberately taken to fight disease.  1405

A Muslim eunuch, Cheng Ho (ca. 1371- ca. 1433), led a series of expeditions southward and westward through the Indian Ocean. His first expedition sailed forth in 1405, with twenty-seven thousand men and three hundred ships, and forced the poten-

tates of the Indonesian islands to accept Chinese overlordship (at least until the ships left).

In a second voyage in 1409, Cheng Ho visited India and Ceylon. When the Ceylonese attacked the ships, he defeated them and brought the ruler of Ceylon a prisoner to China. In later voyages (there were seven in all), he went still farther west, reaching the Red Sea and visiting Mecca and Egypt.

China was aware of its immense self-sufficiency; Portugal was aware of its own insufficiencies. China needed nothing from abroad; Portugal wanted silk, spices, and all sorts of other things. What's more, Portugal was at the very end of the line, farthest from the source, so that it received

least and paid most. And now that the Mongols were gone and the hostile Ottoman Turks were in control of the Middle East (despite the fierce temporary shock of Tamerlane’s career), trade between China and western Europe had dwindled further.

This was the situation that faced Prince Henry of Portugal (1394—1460). It occurred to him that there was no use in trying to trade with the gorgeous East that Marco Polo had so fetchingly described—at

least not by land. Why not instead bypass the Turks altogether and sail around Africa to get there?

The trouble was that no one knew how far south Africa extended, whether the voyage was practical, the seas navigable, the Tropic Zone passable, and so on. (No one paid any attention to Herodotus's wild tale of the Phocnicians having circumnavigated Africa two thousand vears before.)

Prince Henry therefore established an observatory and school for navigation  at Sagres on Cape St. Vincent in 1418. This was in southernmost Portugal, the southwestern tip of Europe Year after year, he outfitted and sent out ships that inched their way farther and farther down the African coast. With Prince Henry, now universally known as Henry the Navigator, the great European Age of Exploration began, and the role that China was

giving up at just about this time, Portugal (and later other European powers) were accepting.

The result was that Chinese vessels never came to Portugal, but Portuguese vessels (and those of other European powers) eventually came to China, and China was to pay dearly for its period of self-satisfaction

The first fruit of Prince

Henry's efforts came in 1418, when Portuguese navigators discovered Madeira. It was a heavily wooded island (the name is from the Portuguese word for “wood”) and was uninhabited. Prince Henry ordered the island settled. The woods were burned down and the land was given over to cultivation, that of sugarcane in particular.

other major stimulu quiry was the Age of Explo ration that had begun ir

the carly 1400s. App

there was a great deal more to the world than the an cients had known. While the Renaissance was

an

gious authority, many scientists and philosophers were no longer content with Aristotle’s world view and other elements of ancient scientific thinking that the Catholic Church had come to embrace. This was the case with astronomy and Nicolaus Copernicus, whose book Concerning the Revolution of the Heavenly Bodies (1543) started the Scientific Revolution. With a Sun-centered system the observed motions of the planets now made sense, although the Church still held that the Earth was the center of the universe. The revolution in astronomy continued. In 1572 Tycho Brahe's report of a new star in the northern sky brought into doubt the ancient idea that the heavens were unchanging. In 1609 Johannes Kepler’s claim that the planets moved in ellipses added fur-

ther insult to the ancient theories, in which the circle was the perfect form. In 1609 Galileo Galilei made a telescope, looked at the Milky Way, and declared for the first time that it was made up of countless faint stars. He was also interested in Earth-based phenomena and in 1589 established that the pull of gravity causes an object to move with constantly increasing speed. This suggestion that gravity, not divine power, caused the movement of the Universe was another challenge to tradition. The work of Isaac Newton in optics, mathematics, and physics was the culmination of the Scientific Revolution. His earliest investigations, into the properties of light, led to his invention of an improved telescope. While pursuing the problem of gravity, he devised calcu-

lus, the basis of higher mathematics. Newton's analysis of the mechanical forces that control the universe justified the findings of Copernicus, Tycho, Kepler, and Galileo. Just as many fields of study were opened during this period, so several fundamentals of the discipline of science were established. The “first publication” rule came to be accepted; it states that credit goes not to the first person who makes a discovery but to the one who first publishes it. Galileo is generally given credit for setting the parameters of experimental science with his work on falling bodies and acceleration. Francis Bacon formalized the philosophical framework for the scientific method: that scientific findings must be based on large amounts of specific observation.

"
1472,Printing,"['Johannes Gutenberg', 'Gutenberg', 'Gutenberg Bibles']","['Chinese', 'Chinese Europe', 'China', 'German', 'Europe']","There is no way to overestimate the importance of writing (see 3500 B.c.). Nevertheless, it can’t be denied that writing is a tedious process, and there have always been efforts to hasten it. The Egyptians worked out faster ways of scrawl-

ing their complicated symbols, and the Romans worked out systems of shorthand.

The ancient Sumerians, however, developed little cylinders of hard stone with designs incised into them that could be rolled onto soft clay so that the designs were impressed, and

these could be made permanent by baking. The cylinders could be used over and over again and served as a signature for the owner. Why could not the same system be used for pressing symbols onto a sheet of paper? If a block with a raised reversed symbol on it is smeared with  ink, it can press an inked symbol (nonreversed) onto paper. The Chinese started doing this about the year 350, and by 800 they were carving entire pages on wooden blocks. Such a page could then be printed any number of times, all the impressions being exactly alike. But then, it took a long time to carve the wooden block into a basrelief with all the symbols perfectly formed.

Later the Chinese got the idea of using a different block for each symbol, so that the blocks could be arranged into any desired combination to give any desired page. By 1450 they had movable wooden char-

acters of this type, and by 1500 they were making use of metal characters.

By then, though, the Europeans had outstripped them (though it is possible that news concerning movable type had reached Europe from China and given the Europeans a head start).

The German inventor Johannes Gutenberg (ca. 1390—1468) had been working out the matter of movable type since 1435. He had paper to work with (it had long ago reached Europe from China) and he experimented with different inks. He also designed a printing press, a device that would press the paper

down un all those little metal characters evenly

By 1454 Gutenberg had worked out all the bugs in his process and was ready for the big task: he began to put out a Bible, in double columns, with forty-two Latin lines to the column. He produced three hundred copies of each of 1282 pages and that produced the three hundred Gutenberg Bibles. It was the first printed book, and many people consider it the most beautiful ever produced—so that the art was born at its height. The Gutenberg Bibles that remain today are the most valued books in the world.

man astronomer, Johann Miiller (1436—1476), refused to allow himself to be governed by fear. (He is better known by his selfchosen name of Regiomontanus, which means King's Mountain, as does the German name of his birthplace, Konigsberg.) Regiomontanus ob-

He turned north again and reached a portion of the African coast that was running eastward. He followed it eastward until it

began turning northward. By that time, his rebellious crew forced him to turn back. He retraced his steps, located the southernmost point of the continent, and reported it to King John II of Portugal (1455-1495) as the Cape of Storms, for obvi

Since it was understood that the Earth was spherical, it was bound to occur to people that it might be circumnavigated and that the Far East could be reached by sailing west. The concept was a sim ple one and, in fact, it had been suggested by Roger Bacon (see 1249) two centuries before. What stopped

people from making the effort was the thought that between the western coast of Europe and the eastern coast of Asia might be a vast stretch of ocean that the ships of the day could not be expected to manag If Eratosthenes was correct and the Earth was 25,000 miles in circumfer: ence (see 240 B.c.), then be tween Europe and Asia were some 12,000 miles of unbroken sea. Yet other au thorities, such as Ptole (see 140), had thought the Earth was smaller than that, and Marco Polo had

1y

thought that Asia extended farther east than it really did

Combining a smaller Earth with a more eastward Asia, an Italian navi gator, Christopher Columbus (14511506 was convinced that a west ward trip from Europe to Asia was a matter of only 3,000 miles. He the

this could be managed, and

he shopped about the var ous nations of western Eu

rope tor hinancial

so that he could outlit an ex pedition.

Portugal was a natural  target, of course, but the Portuguese experts thought the Earth was larger than Columbus’s figure (the Portuguese were right) and were convineed it would not be long before they circumnavigated Africa and reached their goal.

Columbus tried elsewhere without luck and was almost on the point of giving up when things turned out well for him in Spain.

With Ferdinand and Isabella ruling jointly over a united Spain, the nation could assault the last scrap of Muslim rule. This was the nation of Granada in the far south of Spain. The joint monarchs prosecuted a vigorous war against Granada and on January 2, 1492, it fell. What's more, Torquemada engineered the expulsion of the Jews from Spain in 1492. (This was not a new phenomenon, for the Jews had earlier been expelled from England and France. They found a refuge in Poland, which needed a merchant class, and in the Muslim world, which was more tolerant than the Christians, because for one thing, they were at the time more civilized.)

The Spanish monarchs, feeling Spain to be united and strong, decided to give Columbus a minimum of

financial backing. With three old ships and a crew of prisoners released from jail for the purpose, he set forth on August 3, 1492. For seven weeks he sailed westward, encountering no land but also encountering no storms. Finally on October 12, he sighted land—an island, as it turned out, in the Bahamas.

He sailed southward and encountered islands of the West Indies. (To his dying day, Columbus was convinced he had reached the Indies; that is, the eastern coast of Asia. The name of the West Indies and the habit of calling Native Americans Indians are the result of that delusion.)

It was not Asia, of course, that he had come upon, but the American continents, a New World, and the Old World would never be the same again.

Columbus was not, of course, the first human being to set foot on these continents. Siberian natives had done so at least thirty thousand years earlier (see 20,000 B.c.). He was not even the first European to do so, for Leif Eriksson had done it five centuries before (see 1000). Columbus’s feat, however, led almost at once to the beginning of permanent European settlements on the new continents, and that

marked their entry into the common current of world history. It is for this reason that Columbus is generally given credit for the “discovery.”

Incidentally, the fact that new continents existed that were wholly unknown to the ancients helped eliminate the notion that the ancient thinkers had known everything and had solved all problems. Europeans gained the heady feeling that they now moved beyond the ancients, and that helped make possible the Scientific Revolution that was to start in half a century.

1495,Magnetic Declination,['Columbus'],"['Columbus', 'Columbu', 'European']","The magnetic compass, which made a voyage like Columbus’s possible, naturally focused considerable attention on the phenomenon of magnetism. No one knew at this time why the needle pointed north, but people took it for granted that whatever the reason, the needle pointed north steadily and without change.

The person who found out differently was Columbus himself. As he sailed westward, he couldn’t help but notice that the magnetic needle changed some

what in direction. When he started, the compass needle pointed a bit west of true north as determined by the stars. As he traveled westward, the magnetic needle veered eastward, pointed to true north at a certain point, and finally pointed a bit east of north.

reached Calicut, India, on May 20, 1498.

The deed was done. What Prince Henry the Navigator had begun (see 1418) was complete, nearly four decades after his death. The Portuguese had bypassed the Ottoman Empire and the Italian trading cities, such as Venice. From this point on, the Mediterra-

1513,Watches,['Peter Henlein'],"['Nor', 'German']","A mechanical clock had to remain vertical if it was powered by weights being pulled downward by gravity, Nor could it be small, for the weights could not be reduced in size very much without ceasing to work. An alternative to weights came into being, however, when the mainspring was invented about 1470. This

was a spiral spring that could be wound tightly, so that its tendency to unwind would then power the clock.

A German locksmith, Peter Henlein, realized that a mainspring would work just as well when it was small as when it was large, and since it didn’t depend on gravity, it could work in any position. About 1504, therefore, he placed a small

mainspring in a clock small enough to be carried about in a pocket.

Such a small clock was called a watch, because sailors or others who had to maintain a watch at sea or elsewhere for a fixed period of time would find it useful. The original watches had hour hands only and were not particularly accurate, but better things were to come.

One of the leading settlers was Vasco Nufiez de Balboa (1475-1519).

At that time, those Spaniards who thought they were in Asia kept looking for the vast wealth that Marco Polo had talked about, and gold was a particularly concentrated form of wealth, one they particularly lusted for. After all, since the people who lived in these continents

(whether Asians or not) were not Christian, any gold they possessed would rightly belong to any Christians who cared to help themselves to it.

Balboa heard rumors of gold to the west and he organized an expedition to find it. Panama, however, is a narrow isthmus and you can't wander far in it without striking the other coast. Balboa's expedition left on September 1, 1513, and on September 25, he climbed a hill and found himself staring at the limitless expanse of what seemed to be an ocean. Since the coasts of Panama run east-west and

the Atlantic Ocean is on the north shore, Balboa named the new ocean on the south shore the South Sea.

Balboa probably did not realize that this was the second ocean Vespucius had referred to, the one that lay between the American continents and Asia— but it was.

In 1517, Francisco Fernandez de Cérdoba (14752-1525 or 1526), had sailed westward from Cuba and discovered the peninsula of Yucatan. There he was the first to encounter traces of the Mayan civilization, but that was a civilization in ruins.

Westward, however, across the Gulf of Mexico, lay the still flourishing

Aztec Empire, which controlled all of central and southern Mexico and had a population of about 5 million.

In 1519 some six hundred Spaniards under Hernan Cortés (1485—1547) landed with seventeen horses and ten cannon. That this small force sufficed to destroy the Aztec Empire is not as surprising as it may sound and does not imply that Europeans were innately superior to the Aztecs. For one thing, the Aztecs had nothing to counter either the horses or the cannon. For another, the subject peoples of the

Aztecs were restive and ready to fight on the side of Cortés. Finally, the Aztecs and their king, Montezuma II (1466—1520), had the superstitious feeling that the Spaniards were gods whose coming had been predicted, and they did not resist strongly until it was too late.

So the Aztec Empire was destroyed and Mexico was taken over by Spain. No effort was made to save the Aztec culture or retain information concerning it. It was, after all, non-Christian.

When he reached the eastern bulge of South

America, he began looking for a southern end to that continent, which he found on October 21. For over five weeks, he felt his way through what is now known as the Strait of Magellan, amid storms, and on November 28, it opened into an ocean and the storms ceased. As Magellan sailed on and on through good weather, he called this new ocean the Pacific.

However, the Pacific Ocean was far larger than anyone would have expected, and was sadly free of land. For ninety-nine days, the ships sailed through unbroken sea, and the men underwent tortures of hunger and thirst. Finally they reached the island of Guam, then they sailed westward to the Philippine Islands. There, on April 17, 1521, Magellan  died in a skirmish with the inhabitants.

1531,Cubic Equations,"['Niccolo Tartaglia', 'Geronimo Cardano', 'Cardano', 'Tartaglia']","['Italian', 'Italian Tartaglia', 'Tartaglia']","At this time, mathematicians found it easy to solve equations of the first degree (linear equations, involving x) and of the second degree (quadratic equations, involving x?). Equations of the third degree (cubic equations, involving x*) defeated them.

In 1535, however, the Italian mathematician Niccolo Tartaglia (1499-1557) found a general method for solving cubic equations. In those days, mathematicians would often keep their discoveries secret and parade their ability to solve problems others could not. This

raised their reputations and gave them a feeling of power. However, another Italian mathematician, Geronimo Cardano (1501— 1576), wheedled the cubic equation solution out of Tartaglia and then published it, so that Cardano is often given credit for the discovery.

Tartaglia objected loudly, but the event set an important precedent. Scientific discoveries do not belong to the discoverer but to the world. If discoverers all clutched their discoveries close to their chests in order to garner personal glory, the progress of science would creak to a halt.

It has therefore become a rule that credit for a discovery goes not necessarily to the original discoverer, but to the first who publishes the discovery.

This encourages publication and allows all scientists to learn of discoveries as soon as possible. Science as we know it would not exist without the “first publication’' rule, and Cardano, by his dishonorable action, pushed science in that direction, thus doing he world more good than he did Tartaglia harm.  1538

He felt it would be easier to see where the river led him

than to make his way back across the formidable mountain barrier.

From April 1541 to August 1542, he progressed down the river, which as it happened, was by far the greatest in the world in terms of water volume delivered to the ocean and area drained. His report mentioned tribes that ap-

1543,Heliocentric System,"['Moon', 'Nicolaus Copernicus', 'Aristarchus', 'Earth', 'Venus', 'Copernicus', 'Copernicus Aristarchus', 'Copernicus Copernicus', 'De Revolutionibus Orbitm Coelestium', 'Pope Paul II1', 'Copernicus Copernicus Copernicus', 'Ptolemy']","['Aristarchus', 'Hipparchus', 'Ptolemy', 'Polish', 'Greek', 'Aristarchus Aristarchean', 'Nevertheless', 'Church', 'Index']","The speculations of Aristarchus (see 280 B.c.), about a heliocentric system in which the Sun was at the center of the Universe, with the planets, including the Earth, revolving about it, had been disregarded, and the geocentric system of Hipparchus (see 150 B.c.) and Ptolemy (see 140) had been accepted without question.

However, the mathematics needed to work out the planetary motions on a geocentric basis was very difficult. While the Sun and Moon moved steadily westto-east against the stars, the other planets occasionally reversed direction (retrograde motion) and grew markedly brighter and dimmer as they progressed across the sky.

The Polish astronomer Nicolaus Copernicus (1473— 1543) thought, as early as 1507, that if one went back to Aristarchus’s view and supposed that all the planets, including Earth, were moving about the Sun, it would become easy to explain retrograde motion. [t would also be easy to ex-

plain why Venus and Mercury always remained near the Sun and why planets grew dimmer and brighter. In addition to all this, the mathematics for working out planetary motions and positions would be simplified.

Copernicus did not, in his suggestions, abandon all Greek ideas. He clung to the notion that planets had to move in orbits that were circles and combinations of circles, and in this way he retained much unnecessary complexity.

The difference between Aristarchus and Copernicus was that Aristarchus merely presented his notion as a logical way of looking at the planets. Since others thought it wasn't logical, that ended it. Copernicus, however, used the Aristarchean idea to work out the actual mathematics of the planetary motions and show the reduction in complexity. This meant that even if people denied that the heliocentric system could be true, they would still be apt to use it as a simplified device for calculations,

Nevertheless, Copernicus hesitated to publish his theory and his computa-

tions, because he knew that the geocentric theory was felt by the Church to be in accordance with the Bible. To advance a heliocentric theory that would seem to be going against the Bible would surely create a storm. He therefore quietly circulated his book only in manuscript form.

Finally he let himself be persuaded by enthusiastic friends to have the book printed. It was entitled De Revolutionibus Orbitm Coelestium (Concerning the Revolution of Heavenly Bodtes). He dedicated it to Pope Paul II1 (1468—1549) as a placatory gesture, and then died. The story is that Copernicus was given the very first copy ol his book on the day of his death.

As Copernicus had forseen, the book created a loud and violent storm. The Catholic Church put the book on its Index, forbidding the faithful 1o read it, and did not lift the ban till 1835. The Lutherans were equally hostile. The book could not be suppressed, however. With the coming of printing, far too many copies (looded the libraries of the scholars.

Copernicus's book totally overturned Greek as tronomy, and though it was fifty years before astronomers generally could bear to turn their backs on Ptolemy and accept the fact that the vast Earth flew through space on an annual journey about the Sun, the book marked the birth of what came to be called the Scientific Revolution. With it came final proof that the ancients did not know it all and that moderns might strike out on their own in new directions and reach new heights—and they certainly did.

It could be argued that just as printing made the Protestant Reformation possible, it also made the Scientific Revolution possible.

Unlike other anatomists of the period, Vesalius was willing to trust his own eyes when they disagreed with the statements of the Greeks.

He put together the results of his researches in a book entitled De Corporis Humani Fabrica (Concerning the Structure of the Human Body) in which he corrected over two hundred errors of Galen (see 180). What's more, the book took advantage of the technique

of printing to reproduce careful illustrations of anatomical facts, drawn by the Flemish artist Jan Stephan van Calcar (ca. 1499-after 1545), who had been a student of Titian.

Vesalius's book was published in 1543, the same year in which Copernicus’s book appeared, and this double appearance strengthens the feeling that the year marks the beginning of the Scientific Revolution.

that one could not possibly have less than nothing.

On the other hand, mathematicians knew there were such things as debts. To have no money and to owe a sum to someone else means having less than no money. This might seem merely like practical busi-

ness, nothing to do with ethereal numbers, but Cardano (see 1535) showed, in 1545, that debts and similar phenomena could be treated as negative numbers, which would follow rules of mathematics very similar to those that ordinary numbers did. You

Reinhold went over Copernicus’s mathematics, sharpening and improving it, then prepared what he called Tabulae Prutenicae

This might have given rise to evtxlulionary notions, that some basic doglike animal had given rise to both dogs and wolves, as an example. However, the Bible described all animals as being created simultaneously and separately, and it is possible to argue that

God may just have decided to create animals in groups for his own purposes.

It would be more impressive if similarities could be found in more widely diverse organisms, similarities that were not too ebvious to the eyes. This was done by a French naturalist, Pierre Belon (1517-1564).

Francis I of France (1494-1547) was engaged in a prolonged struggle with Charles I of Spain, who was also the Emperor Charles V. Francis was desperate enough to ally himself with the Ottoman Empire, and in 1546 he sent Belon on a diplomatic mission to the Ottomans.

This gave Belon a chance to study plant and animal life in the eastern Mediterranean and to compare it with life in France. He was the first to describe, in writings he published in 1555, basic similarities (homologies) in the skeletons of all vertebrates, from fish to humans. Such details as the number of bones in the limbs were remarkably constant from animal to animal, regardless of the difference in outer appearance.

credit. There would be value in exchanging information, then, for it would benefit all scientists in their search for reputation.

In 1560 an Italian physicist, Giambattista della Porta (1535?-1615), founded the first scientific association designed particularly for this interchange

of ideas, the Academia Secretorum Naturae (Academy of the Mysteries of Nature). It was closed down by the Inquisition, which was oversensitive to any gather-

ings in those harsh days of religious conflict, but the idea was too goad to let go, and other scientific societies were formed in time, and persisted.

These societies helped give rise to a scientific community that was as superior to an individual scientist as a phalanx or legion was to an individual soldier.

1568,Musket,['Muskets'],['Latin'],"By this time, the harquebus had been refined to a musket. The word is from the Latin word for “fly"" and had earlier been applied to the bolts of crossbows, perhaps because the crossbow

bolt or the musket ball whizzed past one's ear with the buzz of a fly.

Muskets could fire balls that penetrated armor, so armor began to disappear. There was no use in bearing the weight if it offered no protection.

For two centuries, muskets remained the principle small arms used by soldiers, but they were still difficult to handle and reload and musketeers needed the protection of pikebearers.

1572,World Maps,"['Gerhard Kremer', 'Gerardus Mercator', 'Mercator', 'Atlas']","['Flemish', 'Greenland', 'Africa', 'Africa Greenland', 'Mercator', 'Greek Titan', 'Greek']","Once the Age of Exploration began, it became important to try to map the world in general and to do so accurately, so that navigators could reach their destinations more easily.

The difficulty was that one cannot map a spherical surface on a plane surface without distortion. Since distortion is unavoidable, therefore, one must find a distortion that will remain useful.

The answer was supplied by a Flemish geographer, Gerhard Kremer (1512-1594), better known by his Latinized name, Gerardus Mercator. In 1568, Mercator perfected his cylindrical projection.

Imagine a hollow cylin-

der encircling the Earth and touching it all around the equator. A light at the Earth’s center can then be imagined as casting the shadow of the surface features on the cylinder, and the cylinder, when unwrapped, will carry a map of the world, a Mercator map.

In this map, the meridians of longitude are vertical and parallel. Since, on the sphere, the meridians of longitude approach each other and meet at the poles, this means that in a Mercator projection, the east-west distances are increasingly exaggerated as one travels north or south from the equator. The parallels of latitude run horizontal and parallel, as they do on the sphere, but as one goes north and south from the

equator, they spread out more widely, too.

On such a map, Greenland looks larger than Africa, although in actual fact, Africa is thirteen times as large as Greenland.

Nevertheless, the Mercator projection is useful for navigators, because a ship that travels in any constant compass direction moves in a straight line on the Mercator projection but in a curved line on any other type of projection.

The cover of Mercator's book of maps showed Atlas, the mythological Greek Titan, holding the world on his shoulders. As a result, that book and all later books of maps have been called atlases.

With Mercator, Greek geography ended and modern geography began.

The supernova of 1054 had gone unobserved in Europe, but times had changed.

A young Danish astronomer, Tycho Brahe (1546— 1601), usually known by his first name, watched the new star carefully from night to night. When he first saw it, it was brighter than Venus, but it gradually faded until in March 1574, it could no longer be seen at all. Tycho had watched it for 485 days.

The Greeks had assumed that the heavens (unlike Earth) were perfect and unchanging. Anythin in the sky that seemed to change (or to move in any thing but a regular and predictable path) could not be part of the sky, they thought, but must be of the atmosphere of the imperfect Earth. This included clouds, shooting stars, and comets.

The new star, being a temporary phenomenon, ought to be part of the atmosphere, 00, but although Tycho tried to determine its parallax (see 150 B.c.), he could detect none. The new star must be beyond the Moon and there

In a second voyage, in 1578, Frobisher sighted Greenland itself (see 982). By the time Frobisher ar-

In 1577 a bright comet appeared in the sky and Tycho observed it carefully. By Greek notions, it was an atmospheric phenomenon, and therefore it should have a large parallax. How-

It occurred to him that the Spanish settlements on the Pacific coast of the Americas were entirely undefended because none of Spain’s enemies had made their way into the Pacific, soin 1572 he had landed at Panama, crossed the Isthmus, and became the first Englishman to see the Pacific.

In 1577 he set sail on an expedition that he hoped would carry him through the Strait of Magellan, which so far only Spanish ships had passed through. No one knew the exact extent of Tierra del Fuego, the land south of the strait, and some thought it was part of a vast Antarctic continent.

Drake passed through the Strait of Magellan in 1578 and was then struck by a storm in the Pacific and driven far enough south to see that open water lay to the south of Tierra del Fuego, which turned out to be nothing more than a moderately

sized island. The water to the south of that island has been known as Drake Passage, or Drake Strait, ever since.

Drake sailed up the Pacific coast of the Americas as far as what we now call San Francisco Bay. He found no water route that would connect with the Atlantic Ocean, so he decided to sail westward across the Pacific. He reached England in 1580, the first person to circumnavigate the globe since Magellan's ship had done so six decades earlier (see 1523).

The sifting of sand or the dripping of water through a small hole, the burning of a candle, or the progress of the Sun across the sky are all fairly constant motions, but might there not be some

convenient action that was even more steadily constant?

The first hint of a constant action that was unknown to the ancients came in 1581, when a seventeenyear-old Italian boy, Galileo Galilei (1564—-1642), who is usually known by his first name, was attending services at the Cathedral of Pisa.

His attention was

caught by a chandelier that swayed as air currents caught it. Sometimes it swung through a small arc, sometimes through a larger one, but to Galileo's inquiring mind, there scemed an anomaly: long or short, the time it took the chandelier to complete its swing back and forth scemed the same. He timed it by the beating of his pulse. Upon returning home, he set up  two pendulums of equal length and swung one in larger, one in smaller sweeps. They kept together and he found he was correct.

Nevertheless, when in later life Galileo conducted experiments in which it was necessary to know the time elapsed, he had to continue to use his pulse or dripping water. Not for another seven decades would the steady beat of the pendulum be put to use as a device to help measure time.

. o Siberia Despite Russia's vast extent

over eastern Europe, its long sleep under the Mon-

gols had left it technologically backward. On Russia’s western boundaries were the Swedes, the Poles, and the Germans, with none of whom Russia could compete militarily. Toward the east, however, were vast spaces that at the moment contained no formidable enemy. This was also a cold region that would ordinarily not seem very enticing except that, as in Russia’s European north, there were animals living there whose pelts, adapted to the Arctic cold, were thick and valuable. In 1581, as Ivan IV’s reign approached its end, the Stroganovs, a Russian family that had made a for-

tune in the fur trade, employed a Cossack named Yermak Timofievich (?— 1584) to explore eastward and expand the Stroganov fur trade. Yermak conquered a Mongol kingdom east of the Urals, named Sibir. The name (Siberia in English) came to be applied to the entire northern third of Asia. This was the beginning of a process that would eventually lead the Russians to the Pacific Ocean and put an end forever to the raids of central Asian nomads against the settled regions to its south and west.

correct. It assumed a year that was 365.25 days long, but the year was more nearly 365.2422 days long. If the year were exactly 365.25 days long, that extra quarter-day could be made

up for by adding an extra day every fourth year. Then every fourth year would be 366 days long (leap year), and in the space of 400 years there would be 100 leap years.

A year that is 36 days long is about 365700 days long. This means that there should be only 97 leap years every 400 years, not 100. By the Julian calendar, 3 days too many were added every 400 years, and the vernal equinox fell earlier and earlier. If the vernal equinox was on March 21 when the Julian calendar was established, then by 1582 it would fall on March 11, 10 days too early

1589,Decimal Fractions,[],['Stevin'],"Mathematicians had found fractions difficult to handle ever since the days of the Sumerians. Special rules had to be worked out to deal with them. In 1586, however, Stevin (see 1583) showed that they could be

made part of ordinary positional notation. To the right of the units column (on the other side of a decimal point) could be the tenths column, then the hundredths column, and so on. Thus 2'2 would become 2.25; 2's would become 2.125; 27/s would become 2.875; and so on.

The disadvantage of

such decimal fractions is that some never end. Thus 23 is 2.3333333 . . . forever; 2% 1s 2.8333333 . . . forever; and so on. Despite this, decimal fractions greatly simplified computations involving fractions.

1589,Falling Bodies,"['Aristotle', 'Simon Stevin', 'Galileo', 'Tower', 'Galileo Galileo', 'Galileo Aristotle', 'Galileo Galilea', 'Peter Peregrinus']",['Pisa'],"Aristotle had stated that the heavier an object was, the more rapidly it would fall. It seemed reasonable to say so. Why shouldn’t a heavier body fall more rapidly? It is clearly being attracted to Earth more strongly, or it wouldn’t be

heavier. Furthermore, anyone who watches a feather, a leaf, and a stone falling will see at once that the stone falls faster than the leaf, which in turn falls faster than the feather. The trouble is that light objects are impeded by air resistance, and in order to avoid that one

should consider only relatively heavy objects. Thus, if one observes the falling of a rock that weighs 1 pound and another that weighs 10 pounds, air resistance is insignificant in either case. Do we then see that the 10-pound rock nevertheless falls faster than the 1-pound rock?  In 1586, Simon Stevin (see 1583) is supposed to have dropped two rocks at the same time, one considerably heavier than the other, and showed that they struck the ground at the same time. Later accounts said it was Galileo who demonstrated this by dropping different weights simultaneously from the Leaning Tower of Pisa. Both stories may or may not be true.

What is certain, though, is that in 1589 Galileo started a series of meticulous tests with falling baodies. Such bodies fall too rapidly to make it easy to measure the rate of fall accurately, especially since no accurate way of measuring short periods of time had yet been worked out.

Galileo therefore allowed balls to roll down inclined planes. The more nearly level the plane, the more slowly the balls moved under the pull of gravity and the more easily their rate of fall could be measured by primitive methods such as water dripping out of a small hole. In this way Galileo found it quite easy to show that as long as the balls were heavy enough to be relatively uninfluenced by air resistance, they rolled down an inclined plane at the same rate.

He was also able to show that the balls rolled down the inclined plane with a constant acceleration—that is, they gained speed with time at a constant rate, under the constant pull of gravity.

This settled another important point. Aristotle had held that in order to keep a body moving, a force bad to be continually applied. This again seemed to fit observation. If an object were sent sliding across a floor, it would quickly slow to a stop. To keep it moving, you would have to keep pushing.

For this reason, it was felt that the planets in their eternal movement about the Earth had to be continually pushed by angels.

Galileo’s observations showed that a constant push was not necessary to keep an object moving, if friction was removed. If a constant pull was exerted by gravity, for instance, an object moved with a constantly increasing speed. Consequently, no angels were required to keep the planets moving.

Galilea's experiments on moving bodies were so impressive that, even though he was not the first to conduct experiments— Peter Peregrinus had done so more than three centuries before (see 1269)—he is

usually given eredit for having founded experimental science.

After all, by substituting or rearranging words or letters according to some prearranged scheme, something that remains plain to the people involved may be made totally obscure 1o others. In such cases, you have a code or cryptogram.

Codes that can be made can be broken, and as the years went by, the use of ever more subtle methods of encoding messages were countered by ever more subtle methods of decoding them.

An early example of this came in 1589, when France was in the last stages of a civil war. Henry I11(1551-1589) had no direct heirs, and his second cousin, Henry of Navarre (1553-1610), was the logical successor. Henry of Navarre was a Huguenot, however, and was bitterly opposed, not only by French Catholics but by Philip II of Spain.

Philip 11 was using a code that the French mathematician Francois Viete (1540-1603; in Latin Franciscus Vieta), working for Henry of Navarre, was able

to decode in 1589. Philip II, unable to account for the fact that his messages were being read, complained to Pope Sixtus V (1521-1590) that the French were using sorcery and ought to suffer ecclesiastical punishment as a result.

In 1589 an English clergyman, William Lee (1550?—1610), invented a device called a stocking frame that would knit faster than hand-knitters could produce their products. This great advantage of the stocking frame was also its great disadvantage, for if it were put into operation on a large scale, it would throw hand-knitters out of work. Elizabeth I of England refused to grant Lee a patent for that very reason.

Lee therefore took his machine to France where he received the necessary support.

Lee's experiences in England are an early example of how the threat of techiological unemployment can slow technological advance. To be sure, technological advance creates more new jobs than it destroys, but there is always a painful transition period, and a humane government must help those who suffer, not so much out idealism (though what is wrong with that?) as to keep society stable and to make it easier to extend the benefits of technological advance to society in general.

The people who would most notice this sort of

thing and be most concerned with it were the spectacle-makers, since the convex lenses used to correct far-sightedness acted to magnify objects.

The spectacle-making industry was most advanced in the Netherlands at this time. It occurred to a Dutch spectacle-maker, Zacharias Janssen (1580ca. 1638), that if one lens

magnified somewhat, two would magnify to a greater extent. He placed a convex lens at each end of a tube and found that magnification was indeed improved. The improvement wasn't great, but Janssen’s tube can be viewed as the first microscope, and its descendants were to revolutionize biology.

analysis) began to symbolize constants and unknowns by letters of the alphabet, the now familiar x’s and y's of algebra. In 1591, he wrote a book about algebra that was the first a present-day highschool student would recognize at a glance to be dealing with that subject.

words to symbols was to mathematics something like the progression from ideographs to letters in ordinary writing, or from Roman numerals to Arabic numerals in arithmetical computation.

than another. Such subjective sensations are useless, however, where small differences in temperature are concerned and are, in any

case, untrustworthy. A humid day feels hotter than a dry day at the same temperature; a windy day colder than a calm day

at the same tempera-

ture.

What is needed is some physical phenomenon that changes regularly in a measurable way with changes in temperature, and the first person to attempt to find such a phenomenon was Galileo (see 1581).

He warmed an empty bulb with a long tube extending from it, then placed the open end of the long tube into a container of water. As the warm air within the bulb cooled, it contracted, and water was drawn up into the tube. As temperature changed and

the air within the bulb cooled or warmed, the water level rose or fell accordingly, and from the position of the level, one could judge the temperature.

This was a very crude device, because for one thing the water level was also affected by the air pressure upon the water reservoir. Nevertheless, it was the first thermometer (from Greek words meaning “to measure heat”).

The Dutch, growing stronger at sea and becoming wealthy through sea trade despite the Spanish soldiers who harassed them, looked for expansion overseas. They had no hesitation in invading lands that were supposedly reserved for the Spanish and Portuguese (both ruled by Philip II). After all, they were anti-Catholic, antiSpanish, and pro-money.

Earth as Magnet

Although the compass had been known for nearly five centuries, no one knew why it pointed north. The English physician and physicist William Gilbert (1544~ 1603) put it to the test and published a book, De Magnete (Concerning Magnets), in 1600 in which he described his experiments. For instance, he tested the general opinion that garlic would destroy magnetism and that diamonds would produce it. He rubbed magnets with garlic

and the magnetism did not disappear. He rubbed unmagnetized iron with diamonds and magnetism did not appear. He took the precaution of doing this before witnesses.

The most important thing he did, however, was to take a large piece of loadstone and fashion a globe out of it. He located its magnetic poles and showed that a compass needle would point north if placed near the surface of this spherical magnet.

What’s more, if he arranged for the compass nee-

dle to swivel vertically, it showed what was called magnetic dip, for it pointed straight through the body of the object. In fact, if the compass needle was held above the magnetic pole, it pointed straight down. (Magnetic dip was first noted on Earth'’s surface by an English navigator, Robert Norman [1560-?], in 1576.)

Gilbert concluded, then, that compass needles acted the way they did because Earth itself was a huge magnet.

The classical belief, inherited from Galen (see 180), was that the blood was manufactured in the liver and carried to the heart, from which it was pumped outward through arteries and veins alike and consumed in the tissues.

Of course, the heart is actually two pumps, with a thick muscular wall between, but there seemed no reason for two pumps. It was Galen's notion that there were small holes in the wall, too small to be visible, and that through these the blood passed, converting the heart into a single pump.

In 1603 an Italian physician, Girolamo Fabrici (1537—-1619), better known by his Latinized name of Fabricius ab Aquapendente, studied the veins of the legs and noted that they

had little valves along their length.

It was clear that the valves prevented the blood from flowing downward. Muscular action during walking squeezed the leg veins and forced the blood upward because that was the only direction in which it could go. This meant that the blood in the leg veins could move only teward the heart.

Fabricius, however,

did not dare to go against Galen's doetrine and he refused to draw this conclusion.  1607

The discovery seems to have come about in 1608 through accident. Hans Lippershey (ca. 1570-1619), a Dutch spectacle-maker, had an apprentice who was

playing with lenses during an idle moment and found that if he held two lenses in front of his eyes, one at a distance from the other, and looked through both, he saw a distant church steeple that seemed considerably closer than it was, and upside down, too. Startled, he told his master, who grasped the importance of the discovery at once. Lippershey mounted the lenses in a

tube that placed them at the proper distance from each other and had the first primitive zelescope (from Greek words meaning “to see far”).

The Netherlands was still in rebellion against Spain, and Lippershey realized that a telescope would be an important war weapon, making it possible to see the approach of enemy ships or troops before they could be made out

by the eye alone. He explained this to Maurice of Nassau (see 1586), who saw the point and made an at tempt to keep the nature of the device secret. The elfort failed, however. Rumors spread, and the device was too simple not to be reconstructed at once

Surely the heavens would not deal with anything else.

Planetary movements, however, did not match the

notion of simple circular orbits, and the Greeks had to assume combinations of circles that grew more and more complicated as observations of actual planetary motions across the sky grew more precise Copernicus placed the Sun, rather than the Earth at the center of the Uni verse, but kept circular os bits, which meant that there still had to be compli cated combinations, al-

Kepler tried to work out an orbit that would best fit the data Tycho had gathered.

Kepler tried a number of things that didn’t work and was finally driven to the all-but-unthinkable alternative of considering orbits that were not circles Finally, he had his answer and, in 1609, published it in a book entitled Astrononiia Nova (New Astronomy). In it, he maintained that planets moved about the Sun in ellipses (flattened circles whose geometric properties had first been explained by the Greek mathematician Apollonius in the first century B.C.). The Sun was located at one of the two foci of the ellipse, and with such orbits, no curve combinations were required. Our present picture of the Solar System (that is, the Sun plus its retinue of planets and other bodies) remains essentially that worked out by Kepler No substantial change is expected in the future.

The elliptical orbit is Kepler’s First Law of planetary motion. He also advanced a Second Law in his

book, which described how the planetary speed altered with distance from the Sun. With the Sun at one focus of an ellipse, the planet was closer to the Sun (and moved faster) in one half of the orbit than in the other.

1609,The Milky Way,"['Milky Way', 'Milky Way Galileo', 'Milky Way Democritus', 'Galileo']",['Earth'],"The Milky Way is a dim band of foggy light that encircles the sky. Many were the speculations as to what it was. It might be a spurt of milk from a goddess’s breast, or it might be a bridge used by the gods to travel from Earth to Heaven or vice versa. Democritus (see 440 B.C.) sug“t’\[Ld that the Milky Way a conglomeration of vast numbers of stars that were individually too dim to be seen. That, however,

was just a speculation.

In 1609, however, Galileo heard rumors of the construction of a telescope in the Netherlands the year before. From what he heard, he had little trouble devising a telescope for himself, and for the first

time, he turned one on the sky.

When he looked at the Milky Way through the telescope, he found that it was indeed composed of a myriad of faint stars. Democritus had been absolutely correct.

In fact, wherever Galileo looked he saw additional stars that, without the telescope, were too dim to be seen. The sky was full of them.

He found that it contained craters, mountains, and dark areas that he thought might be seas. These dark areas are still called maria, which is the Latin word for “seas.” It was quite obvious that the Moon was not a heavenly globe of light, but was a world that in some ways resembled Earth. Aristotle’s notion that heavenly bodies were of a structure different from that of Earth thus received a blow.

Clearly, they were extended bodies but were tov small, or too distant, or both, to show as orbs to the unaided eve. (The stars, however, remained points of light even when viewed by telescope.)

Jupiter was not only an orb but, in January 1610, Galileo observed four dimmer objects in its immediale vicinity. As he watched from night to night, he saw that they were circling Jupiter, as the Moon circles the Earth. They were, in short, four moons of Jupiter Kepler (see 1609) later referred to them as satellites, a Latin word referring to those who remain close to

someone rich or powerful in the hope of picking up scraps and favors

Jupiter’s four satellites were the first objects ever seen in the sky that clearly circled some object other than Earth, which was a strong point against Ptol emy’s geocentrism. For that reason, the discovery displeased the rigidly religious. Some refused to | through the telescope in

Since 16 X 32 = 512, we can say that 2% X 25 = 27, Instead of multiplying numbers, we add exponents. This turns out to be a general rule. In the same way, instead of dividing numbers, we can subtract exponents.

If 16 is 2% and 32 is 25, then 22 must be 2 to some exponent that lies between 4 and 5. If we had the exponents for all numbers listed

in a convenient table, multi-

plication would be reduced to addition, and division to subtraction, with a

great saving in time and trouble

The Scottish mathematician John N r (15501617) spent years working out formulas that would give him appropriate exponents for a great many numbers, and he called them logarithms (from Greek words meaning “proportionate numbers”).

To them, and to those who followed them, any vapor was a kind of air. The Flemish physician Jan Baptista van Helmont (1579—1644) worked with

vapors, however, and it seemed clear to him that some vapors had properties so different from others, and from ordinary air, that they represented different substances. Just as there were different liquids and solids, so there were different airs.

In 1624 Helmont felt he

needed a word to use for such airs generally. It seemed to him that since airs had no specific volume but filled any container, they were examples of matter in complete chaos. He called them chaos, spelling the word according to its pronunciation in Flemish so that it came out gas. The  term did not become popular at once, but eventually it gained equality with liguid and solid to represent the three ordinary states of matter.

In particular, Helmont studied the gas produced by burning wood. He called this gas sylvestre (wood gas), but we know it as carbon dioxide.

In 1242 an Arabic scholar, Ibn an-Nafis (d. 1288), wrote a book in which he suggested that the right and left ventricles were totally separate Blood was pumped out of the right ventricle into arteries that led it to the lung. There, in the lungs, the arteries divided into smaller and smaller ves-

sels, within which the blood picked up air from the lungs. The vessels were then collected into larger and larger vessels until they were brought back to the left ventricle from which the blood was pumped out to the body generally.

In this way, the double pump was explained. One pump was needed for the lungs and aeration; the other for the rest of the body. An-Nafis had grasped the lesser circulation. However, his book was not known to the West until 1924, and it had no effect on later developments.

In 1553 a Spanish physician, Miguel Serveto, known as Michael Servetus

(1511-1553), published a book in which he too described the lesser circulation. The major part of the book, however, dealt with the Servetus's theological views, which were Unitarian. Servetus, having ventured into Geneva, which was ruled by his deadly enemy, John Calvin (see 1541), was taken into custody and burned at the stake.

Calvin then attempted to destroy all copies of Servetus’s book, and it wasn't till 1694 that some unburned copies were found.

In 1559 an Italian anatomist, Realdo Colombo (15162-1559), became the third person to understand,  independently, the lesser circulation. His work was the first to reach the medical profession, and it was much more detailed and careful than those of his two predecessors, so it is Colombo who gets credit for the discovery.

Then came the English physician William Harvey (1578-1657). He studied the heart carefully and noticed that each side had

valves that allowed blood to enter each of the two ventricles but not to leave except by way of arteries.

He also knew about the valves in the veins, since he had studied under Fabrici (see 1603), who had discoyered them. He experimented with animals, tying off a vein or an artery and noting that the blood piled up in a vein on the side away from the heart, but in

an artery on the side toward the heart. It was clear to him that blood flowed away from the heart in arteries and back to the heart in veins.

By 1628, he had all the evidence he needed and he published a seventy-twopage book in the Netherlands with the title De Mot Cordis et Sangtiinis {Concerming the Mations of the Heart and Blood). In it,  he advanced his findings concerning the circulation of the blood: It leaves the right ventricle, goes to the lungs, and returns to the left ventricle. It then leaves

the left ventricle, goes to the body generally, and returns to the right ventricle to begin all over.

The book was received sourly by the medical pro-

fession, but Harvey lived long enough to see it accepted. His book represents the beginning of modern physiology.

® Science and Religion Galileo had long accepted the Copernican idea of a heliocentric planetary system, but he was reluctant to be open in this view, for the papacy was strong in Italy and geocentrism was the only allowable astronomical view in Catholic doctrine of the time.

Urban VIII (1568— 1644) had become Pope in 1623, and Galileo thought him to be a friend. In 1632, therefore, he took the

chance of publishing a book with the title, in English, Dialogue on the Two Chief World Systems. The dialogue has three actors: a Ptolemy-supporter, a Copernicus-supporter, and a neutral person seeking information.

The book created a stir. In the first place, it was written in Italian rather than in Latin, so that it was not confined to scholars but could reach the general public. In the second place, Galileo was a brilliant writer, much given to sarcasm, and he certainly gave

the Copernican the best of it. What's more, it was easy to persuade the Pope that the Ptolemy-supporter was meant to be a satire on him personally.

Galileo was therefore brought before the Inquisition in the most famous confrontation between science and religion prior to the evolution controversy in the present century.

On June 22, 1633, under the threat (but not the use) of torture, he was forced to renounce any of his views that were at variance with geocentrism.

Sometimes Galileo is blamed for giving in, but he was seventy at the time, and he had the example of Bruno (see 1600), a genera

truth by good reasoning, that is.

In a hundred-page appendix to this book, Descartes combined algebra and geometry. He pointed out that if one drew two perpendicular straight lines, marked the intersection 0, and laid off units on each line, positive numbers to the right and up, negative numbers to the left and down, then every point in the plane could be represented by two numbers, one for its position along the horizontal axis and the

second for its position along the vertical axis. (One could add a third axis, in and out, and locate every point in the Universe by three numbers.)

Straight lines and curves could then be expressed by algebraic equations, which would locate every point on the line or curve with reference to the two axes. This combination of disciplines, producing analytic geometry, strengthened both. Geometric problems could be solved algebraically, and algebraic equations could be illustrated geometrically.

It also laid the foundation for the development of the calculus, which is essentially the application of algebra to smoothly changing phenomena that can be represented geometrically by curves of various sorts.

Here is something that involved him.

It is possible to have two squares that add up to a third square: 32 + 42 = 52,0r9 + 16 = 25. There are an infinite number of such cases. Are there, however, two cubes that add up to a third cube, or two fourth powers that add up to a fourth power, and so on?

A particular spot could be located and accurately centered at the crossing point of the hairs and the telescope then shifted to a neighboring star, making use of a device to measure how great an angle the

telescope had turned through.

This began the conversion of the telescope from a mere viewing toy to an instrument of precision. However, Gascoigne was killed in battle before he could properly develop his discovery. It was twenty years before cross hairs were rediscovered and put to general use in telescopes.

With such a machine, as long as the correct numbers were entered into the

device, there was no possibility of a mistake,

This was pure speculation, but the later Europeans took Greek speculation seriously.

Both South America and Africa extended into the southern hemisphere, but they didn't seem to fulfill the requirements. There ought to be a continent that was entirely in the southern hemisphere. The Pacific Ocean was clearly vast, covering nearly half the area of the globe. Since Magellan had first entered it (sec 1523), no significant land area had been found, but little of it had as yet been explored.

The Indonesian islands,

which straddled the Equator, seemed a good place to start. In 1606 a Spanish navigator, Luis Vaez de Torres (fl. 1606), sailed all around the island of New Guinea and showed that it was not part of a continental landmass. It proved to be the second-largest island in the world. The narrow stretch of water south of New Guinea is called Torres Strair in the explorer’s honor.

When the Dutch became dominant in the Indonesian islands, the Dutch governor-general Anthony van Diemen (1593-1645) sent out an exploring expedition under Abel Janszoon Tasman (1603?-1659).

On August 14, 1641, Tasman left the island of Java and for ten months sailed the Pacific. He discovered an island he named Van Diemen’s Land, in honor of his chief, but it is now known as Tasmania in his own honor. He also discovered the southern island of what is now known as New Zealand.

The astonishing thing about Torres's and Tasman’s voyages is that neither managed to spot Australia, a picce of land as  large as the United States New Guinea is only 100 miles from northeastern Australia, and Tasmania is only 230 miles from south-

eastern Australia, but both somehow managed to miss it.

In 1644 Tasman did finally spot a portion of the

Australian coast and called it New Holland, but he didn't explore it further.

1648,Barometer,"['Evangelista Torricelli', 'Galileo', 'Galileo Torricelli', 'Torricelli', 'Torricelli Once Torricelli', 'Torricelli Otto', 'Aristotle']","['Italian', 'Torricellian', 'German']","It had long troubled mining engineers and others that pumps could not lift water more than 33 feet above its natural level. The usual pump produced a partial vacuum, which the water rushed upward to fill, but apparently the rush had its limits. The Italian physicist Evangelista Torricelli (1608—-1647) worked for Galileo in that scientist's last years, and Galileo sugsted that his assistant investigate this pumping problem.

It occurred to Torricelli that the water was lifted not because it was pulled

up by the vacuum, but because it was pushed up by the normal pressure of air, After all, the vacuum in the pump produced a low air pressure and the normal air outside the pump pushed harder

In 1643, to check this theory, Torricelli made use of mercury. Since mercury'’s density is 13.5 times that of water, air should be able to lift it only Y135 times as high as water, or 30 inches. Torricelli filled a 6-foot length of glass tubing with mercury, stoppered the open end, upended it in a dish of mercury, unstoppered it, and found the mercury pouring out of the

tube, but not altogether: 30 inches of mercury remained in the tube, as expected.

Above the mercury in the upended tube was a vacuum (except for a small quantity of mercury vapor). It was the first one ever artificially created—a Torricellian vacuum.

Torricelli noticed that the height of the mercury column varied slightly from day to day and surmised correctly that the atmosphere possessed a slightly different pressure at different times. He had invented the first barometer  Once Torricelli had produced a vacuum t allow

1648,Air Pressure and Altitude,['Pascal'],"['Torricelli', 'Pascal']","If the mercury column of Torricelli's barometer (see 1643) were held up by air pressure, then if one went up high in the air, there should be less air above, and the air pressure should decrease. Therefore, so should the height of the mercury column.

To test this, Pascal (see 1642) sent his brother-inlaw up a neighboring mountain with a couple of barometers. His brother-in-law climbed about a mile and found that the mercury columns had dropped from 30 to 27 inches.

This showed clearly

that the atmosphere could only have a finite height. In fact, if it were as dense throughout as it was at sea level, it would be only 5 miles in height.

Even when it became apparent that air became less dense with height, so that quantities of it extended far higher than 5 miles, there had to be limits. At a height of 100 miles or so, air would be so thin that it might as well be vacuum, and so for all the rest of the distance to the Moon and to other heavenly bodies.

Experiments like those of Torricelli and Pascal’s brother-in-law amounted to the discovery of outer

space.

1650,Fluid Pressure,['Pascal'],[],"About 1648, Pascal also studied fluid pressure by exerting pressure on water and noting how that pressure was transmitted against the walls of a closed vessel. He concluded that when pressure is exerted on a fluid in a closed vessel, it is transmitted undiminished throughout the fluid and that it pushes at right angles to all surfaces that it touches. This is called Pascal’s principle and is the basis of the hydraulic press.

This was the first double star to be detected.

only one that claimed to give the history of Earth from the creation, and it was generally accepted by all scientists as the authoritative word of God at this time and for two more centuries. (Many people accept it as such to this day.)

The Bible does not use any acceptable chronology for its early history, but by following back from the reign of King Saul and making use of hints here and there in the earlier historical sections, it is possible to decide what the biblical date of the creation might have been.

In 1650 James Ussher (1581-1656), an Anglican bishop, worked out the d

of the creation in this wa and decided it had taken place in 4004 B.c. Four years later an English theo logian, John Lightfoot (1602—1675), sharpened the date and made it 9 a.m October 26, 4004 B.c

Such dating of creation has no valid basis whatever, but it has strongly influenced popular opinion to the present day.

Names on the Moon

In 1651 Riccioli (see 1650, Double Stars) published Almagestunt Novunt (New Almagest). The reference to

Ptolemy’s old book (see 140) was not accidental, for Riccioli rejected heliocentricity and insisted on an Earth-centered astronomy a full century after Copernicus's book had been pub-

lished.

The book, however, included a map of the Moon with names given to the

various craters. Riccioli

began the habit of naming surface features on other worlds after astronomical

notables, and many of his  0o

names are still used. Of course, he gave the most conspicuous crater on the

Moon the name of Tycho, whom he admired extravagantly. Another large one

was Prolemaeus. Copernicus is a pretty notable crater, and Kepler is not bad either.

1654,Lymphatics,['Olof Rudbeck'],"['Greek', 'Swedish']","Veins and arteries had been known since Greek times, but in 1653 a third set of vessels was discovered. The Swedish naturalist Olof Rudbeck (1630-1702) demonstrated their existence in

a dog. These new vessels resembled veins but had thinner walls and carried the clear watery fluid portion of the blood (lymph), so that the vessels were called lymphatics. The lymph is forced out of the smallest blood

vessels and into the spaces around the cells, forming the interstitial fluid. This drains into the lymphatics and is carried back into the blood vessels in various parts of the body.

ways of measuring the likelihood of certain situations so as to know which way to bet their money, and how much, If they did not do

this, they would quickly lose all their money to those who did.

A certain French gambler, Chevalier de Mere

(1610-1685), was puzzled at the fact that he kept losing money in a certain game of dice, which he felt he ought to win. In 1654 he consulted Pascal (see 1642) on the matter, who in turn consulted Fermat (see 1637). Pascal and Fermat worked out mathematical techniques for judging the likelihood of certain combinations appearing in the fall of (honest) dice. In doing so, they laid the foundations for the theory of probability.

The chief function of probability was to deal with large numbers of events, which singly were random in nature but in total were predictable. As time went on, considerations of probability proved

to be almost inconceivably important in the development of science.

For instance, he affixed a rope to a piston and had fifty men pull on the rope while he slowly created a vacuum on the other side of the piston within the cylinder. Air pressure inexorably pushed the piston into the cylinder despite the struggles of the fifty men to prevent it.

Then he prepared two metal hemispheres that fitted together along a

greased flange. (They were called Magdeburg hemispheres because Guericke was mayor of Magdeburg.) When the hemispheres were put together and the air within them evacuated, air pressure held them together even though teams of horses were attached to the separate hemispheres, straining to their utmost in opposite directions. When air was allowed to enter the joined hemispheres, they fell apart of themselves. This demonstration took place before the eyes of Ferdinand IIT (1608— 1657), who became Holy Roman Emperor in 1637. He was so impressed, he ordered Guericke's work to be written up and published.

There seemed to be projections on either side. He could not quite make them out, and after a while they disappeared. It annoyed Galileo. After all, he had been attacked by religionists who said that his telescope produced optical illusions, and here was one case where

perhaps it did. He refused to look at Saturn again.

In 1655, however, the Dutch astronomer Christiaan Huygens (1629-1695), with the help of a Dutch philosopher and optician, Benedict Spinoza (1632— 1677), worked out a new and better method for grinding lenses. He installed his improved lenses in a telescope that was 23 feet long, and with that he studied Saturn in 1656.

He could see what it

was that had puzzled Galileo. Saturn was surrounded by a thin, broad ring that did not touch the planet at any point. No other object in the sky had so peculiar a structure, and Saturn is widely considered the most beautiful object in the sky because of it.

In addition, he discovered that Saturn had a salellite, which he named Titan (because Saturn, or Cronos as the Greeks called him, was the leader of a  group of gods called Titans).

That same year, he dis-

covered that the middle star of Orion’s sword was not a star but a cloud of luminous gas. It is now known as the Orion nebula.

1657,Pendulum Clock,"['Galileo', 'Huygens']",['Huygens'],"Up to this time, the best timepieces were still the mechanical clocks of medieval days that could not keep time to better than a large fraction of an hour.

Galileo's discovery of the principle of the pendulum did not help immediately. An ordinary pendulum swings in the arc of a circle, and when it does that it doesn’t have a constant period. The period becomes a little longer through a wide arc than through a narrow one.

If the pendulum could swing through a cycloid (very like a circle over a small arc), then the period would remain truly constant, Huygens (see above) showed how to arrange matters so that the pendu-

lum would swing through a cycloid. He then hooked it up to falling weights in such a way that the pendulum controlled the rate at which the weights fell and made it truly constant.

In 1656 Huygens had the first pendulum clock (or as it is sometimes called, grandfather's clock). 1t was the first timepiece that could tell time to a minute or better and was the first accurate enough to be useful to scientists.

tance, and if this could be observed, the question could be settled directly instead of by inference.

The English physicist Robert Hooke (1635—1701) designed an air pump that worked better and more quickly than Guericke's

(see 1645). When Hooke had a good vacuum in a large jar, he arranged for a feather and a coin to be released from the top of the jar at the same time, and behold, they dropped at the same speed.

The Dutch naturalist Jan Swammerdam (16371680) studied insects under the microscope and collected some three thousand species of them, so that he is considered the father of modern entomology

Swammerdam'’s most famous discovery, however, made in 1658, was the red blood corpuscle. Present in the bloodstream in the billions, red blood corpuscles carry the chemical that absorbs oxygen from the air in the lungs, though this was not known till much later.

approaches Earth more closely than any other planet, remained featureless, because it seemed to have a heavy cloud layer. Mars, next closest, was different. In 1659, Huygens (see 1656, Saturn’s Ring)

According to Harvey, the blood traveled from the heart through the arteries, into the veins, and back to the heart. But how did the blood get from the arteries to the veins? There was no visible connection, and Harvey was forced to maintain that the connection consisted of blood vessels that were too small to see.

The microscope was now an important tool, however, and a pioneer in this field was the Italian physiologist Marcello Malpighi (1628—-1694). The thin wing-membranes of the bat contained what was virtually a two-dimensional network of blood vessels. Malpighi studied it under the microscope in 1660 and saw the tiniest arteries and

veins connected by vessels too small to see without the microscope. He called the tiny vessels capillaries, from a Latin word meaning """"hair-like.” Harvey's theory was complete, but Harvey hadn’t lived to see it. He had died three years before.

1661,Static Electricity,"['Whereas', 'William Gilbert', 'Earth', 'Gilbert', 'Guericke']","['Thales', 'Greek', 'Greek Guericke']","When Thales (see 585 B.c.) studied the magnetic properties of loadstone, he is also supposed to have studied amber, which, when rubbed, attracts light objects. Whereas magnets attract only iron, rubbed amber attracts many things.

William Gilbert, who showed that Earth was a magnet (see 1600), found that rock crystal and a variety of gems showed the same attractive force when rubbed that amber did.

Since the Greek word for

amber was elektron, Gilbert called these substances electrics, and the phenomenon came to be called electricity. Because the electricity in electrics seemed to stay put if left undisturbed, it was referred to eventually as static electricity, from a Greek word meaning “to stand.”

The first to demonstrate static electricity on a large scale was Guericke, who had invented the air pump (see 1645). The electrical phenomenon was produced by rubbing, and Guericke in 1660 fashioned a globe of sulfur that could be rotated on a crankturned shaft. When it was stroked with the hand as it rotated, it accumulated quite a lot of static electricity. It could be discharged and recharged indefinitely, and Guericke could produce sparks from his electrified globe.

1662,Chemical Elements,"['Aristotle', 'Robert Boyle', 'Boyle', 'Boyle Franz Deleboe', 'Franciscus Sylvius', 'Sylvius']","['Aristotle', 'Dutch']","It had been just about two thousand years now since Aristotle listed the four elements (earth, water, air, and fire) that made up the Earth and a fifth (aether) that made up the heavenly bodies. That still remained the dominant theory, although some alchemists had considered mercury, sulfur, and salt to be particularly important.

But the day of alchemy was over. The Irish-born physicist and chemist Robert Boyle (1627-1691) published a book in 1661 that was called The Skeptical Chymist, and as a result, the very name alchemist was changed to chemist. The dropping of the prefix al-, which is the Arabic rhe, seemed somehow to symbolize turning the back on medievalism. In this book, Boyle also divorced chemistry from medicine and made it a separate science.

Boyle’s most important feat was to push chemistry in the direction of becoming an experimental science. He wanted chemical elements to be established by experimentation rather than by deduction.

He pointed out that an element was one of the simple components of the Earth, one that could not be converted into anything simpler. Therefore, anything that couldn’t be converted into anything simpler was an element, while anything that could be so converted was not. The only way you could differentiate an element from a nonelement, then, was to try hard to make a substance simpler.

Acid-Base Balance

Hippocrates (see 420 B.c.) had maintained that health was preserved by the proper balance of the four humors (blood, phlegm,

bile, and black bile), and this idea had also lasted

two thousand years, like

the four elements of Aristotle.

The Dutch physician Franz Deleboe (1614-1672), better known by the Latinized name Franciscus Sylvius, denounced the fourhumor theory in 1661 and suggested instead that health depended on the balance of acids and bases in the body. This was certainly an improvement on the older view.

Sylvius also studied digestive juices such as saliva and suggested that digestion was a chemical process (fermentation) rather than a mechanical one (grinding). In this, he was quite right.

"
1662,Boyle’s Law,"['Boyle', 'Robert Hooke', 'Boyle Boyle', 'Boyle Liquids']",['Democritus'],"As Boyle experimented with vacuums, it was he who employed Robert Hooke to build an improved air pump (see 1657).

The air pump got Boyle interested in gases, and in 1662 he discovered that air could be compressed. He did this by trapping some air in the short closed end of a J-shaped 17-foot-long glass tube into which he poured mercury to close off the bottom curve.

If he next added more mercury to the open end, the weight of the additional mercury squeezed the trapped air in the closed end more closely together, and its volume decreased. Indeed, Boyle found that the volume of the gas varied inversely with the pressure upon it. That is, if he doubled the weight of mercury upon it, the volume shrank to one-half the original; if he tripled the weight

of mercury, the volume shrank to one-third, and so on. This is called Boyle's Law.

The most important conclusion of this experiment was that air, and presumably other gases, were atomic in nature and that the atoms were widely spread apart. With pressure, the atoms were forced more closely together and the volume shrank.

Liquids and solids could not be compressed with the same ease that gases could be, but that did not necessarily mean they

weren't composed of atoms.

In their cases, the atoms might already be in contact.

The idea of atomism had not entirely died out since the time of Democritus (see 440 B.c.). There had always been a few from time to time who accepted atoms. Boyle's experiments, however, were the strongest evidence yet, and

Boyle himself became a convinced atomist. It was to be a century and a half, however, before atomism won out entirely.

He therefore gave a legal charter to the Royal Society in 1662. For years, it represented the most brilliant assemblage of scientists since the great days of Alexandria.

His most important discovery (though it did not seem so at the time, no doubt) involved the structure of cork. Under the microscope, he found a thin sliver of cork to be composed of a finely serried pattern of tiny rectangular holes. These he called cells, from a Latin word for “small chamber” —especially one of the type that exists in rows, as monastery cells or prison cells do.

1665,Light Diffraction,"['Particles', 'Francesco Maria Grimaldi', 'Grimaldi']",['Italian'],"It was about this time that the question of waves versus particles began to

be raised, one that was

to be argued for a long time.

Water waves could be seen, and the fact that they tended to curve around obstacles could be considered a characteristic of all waves. Particles, on the other hand, if moving in a straight line, did not curve around obstacles but either struck and bounced back (being reflected) or missed and continued moving in a straight line.

Since sound curved around obstacles, it was taken to be a wave phenomenon. Since light cast sharp shadows, it was natural to think of it as composed of tiny particles.

An Italian physicist, Francesco Maria Grimaldi (1618-1663), made an observation that was published posthumously in 1665. He had let a beam of light pass through two narrow apertures, one behind the other, and then fall on a blank surface. He found that the band of light on that surface was a trifle wider than the apertures.

He believed, therefore, that the beam had been bent slightly outward at the edges of the aperture, a phenomenon he called diffraction.

This would make it seem that light was a wave phenomenon.

But a wave's bending about an obstacle depends on the relative size of the wave and the obstacle. Any wave will be reflected by a barrier considerably larger than itself: water waves will be reflected by a breakwater and sound waves will be reflected by a cliff wall. Since light waves were reflected from small objects, and diffraction was only very slight, it must follow that if light were composed of waves, they were very small waves indeed.

However, Grimaldi's work was largely neglected and the controversy went on for a century and a half without reference to him.

In this way, in 1665, the Italian-born French astronomer Gian Domenico Cassini (1625-1712) determined that Mars rotated in 24 hours 40 minutes, while Jupiter rotated in 9 hours 56 minutes.

1668,Light Spectrum,"['Isaac Newton', 'Newton', 'Newton Matter']",['English'],"The English scientist Isaac Newton (1642—-1727), curious about light, conducted a series of crucial experiments in 1665 and 1666. He allowed a beam of light to pass through a prism (a triangular piece of glass) and then fall on a white wall. What emerged was a band of colors, the least bent portion of the light being red, and then following, in order, orange, yellow, green, blue, and violet,

each merging gradually into the next.

Were the colors produced by the glass? No, for when Newton passed the light that had emerged from the prism through a second prism oriented in the opposite direction, all he got was white light. The colors had recombined.

This meant that light had to be looked upon in a totally new way. It had always been assumed that white light was “pure” light and that color was in-

troduced as an impurity through the effect of material substances on the light.

Newton’s work made it clear that color was an inherent property of light and that white light was a mixture of different colors. Matter affected color only by absorbing some kinds of light and transmitting or reflecting others.

Exactly what it was

that made light assume different colors was not yet

clear, however.

1668,Conservation of Momentum,['John Wallis'],"['English', 'Zero']","In studying motion, it became clear that motion wasn't created out of nothing. If some moving object struck another object at rest, it might well impart motion to the second object. (Anyone playing billiards can see this.) Yet a great deal of motion in a light object would impart only a small motion to a heavy object. (Anyone kicking a cannonball can see this.)

Perhaps if one multiplied the mass by the velocity, it would be that product that stayed the same. The product of mass and velocity is called momentum (from a Latin word for “movement”). The English mathematician John Wallis (1616—1703) was the first to suggest, in 1668, that the total momentum of a closed system (one into which no momentum from the outside entered, and

from which no momentum leaked into the outside) remained always unchanged. This is called the law of conservation of momentum.

Momentum can be shifted from one part of a system to another but can neither be created nor destroyed. Momentum can be in either of two directions —let us say, plus or minus. If one starts off with no momentum at all in a closed system, one part may start moving in one direction (the plus direction) if another part starts moving in the opposite (minus) direction. If the two momenta (movements) are equal and opposite, they cancel, and the total momentum remains zero. Similarly, if two bodies come together with equal and opposite momenta (total, zero), they can bounce off each other, having switched the plus and minus to some extent, or they can stick together and both be motionless (the total always remaining Zero).

Such a conservation law explains a great many things about motion that would otherwise be puzzling. The law of conservation of momentum was the first of the conservation laws to be understood, but others would, in time, follow, and all are fundamental to our understanding of the structure and functioning of the Universe.

1668,Spontaneous Generation,"['Francesco Redi', 'Redi']",['Italian'],"It has always been commonly supposed that some forms of life can arise spontaneously from nonlife. This has been especially so in connection with life forms that human beings do not want—weeds and vermin. Useful forms of life require the utmost care, but useless or harmful forms seem to flourish despite human effort to eradicate them. It is tempting to believe that these pests arise out of nowhere. Be sides, there is the evidence of the eyes. One can see how maggots, for instance, arise out of decaying meat. The meat is dead but gives rise to living maggots. Spontaneous generation seems unquestionable.

In 1668, however, the Italian physician Francesco Redi (1626—-1697) decided to test the matter experimentally.

He prepared eight flasks with a variety of meats in them. Four he sealed and four he left open to the air. Flies could land only on the meat in the open vessels, and only those bred maggots. The meat in the closed vessels turned just as putrid—but no maggots.

To test whether it was the absence of fresh air that did it, Redi repeated the experiments without sealing any flasks but covering four with gauze instead. The air was not excluded from the gauze-covered flasks, but

flies were, and there were no maggots in those flasks.

(This was the first clear-cut case of the use of proper controls in a biological experiment.)

Redi concluded that maggots did not arise by spontaneous generation but hatched [rom eggs laid by flies, eggs too small to be easily visible. This did not settle the matter generally, but it was difficult thereafter Lo believe that life forms large enough to be visible to the unaided eye arose by spontaneous generation.

1669,Reflecting Telescopes,[],['Newton'],"During the first sixty years of the telescope’s use, its lenses curved light by refraction and focused it. In this way, the eye saw the image as brightened and expanded. Such telescopes were refracting telescopes. Unfortunately, the lenses refracted different colors of light differently and formed a spectrum, so that the images in such tele-

scopes were always blurred by colored rings, red or blue (chromatic aberration). This was minimized by using only the center of the lens and having the light come together only g ally and reach a [ocus considerable distance from the lens, but this meant that telescopes capable of

considerable brightening and enlargement had to be long and unwieldy.

Newton, through his experiments with light (see 1666), supposed that one couldn’t possibly have a lens without blurring the image with color. He therefore thought of an alternative. Why not use curved mirrors instead of curved lenses, and focus the light by reflection rather than refraction? Reflection did not produce a spectrum.

In 1668, therefore, he built the first reflecting telescope, and thereafter two

1669,Calculus,"['Kepler', 'Newton', 'Earth', 'Earth Gottfried Wilhelm Leibniz', 'Leibniz']","['Newton', 'London', 'Newton German', 'Newton English', 'German', 'Newton Leibniz']","In the years 1665—1666, Newton (see 1666) was staying at his mother’s farm in order to escape the London plague. One evening he saw an apple fall from a tree at a time when the Moon was shining peacefully overhead and began to wonder why the Moon didn't fall. He then thought that perhaps it did, but that it was also moving horizontally and fell at each moment just enough to make up for the curvature of the Earth. Thus, the Moon fell forever but only succeeded in moving around the Earth in one of Kepler’s ellipses. Newton spent considerable time trying to work out how Earth might pull at the Moon as it pulled at the apple, and at what rate the Moon might be falling, but he was not satisfied with his calculations and put them to one side. Some say it was because there was no good determination of the exact size of the Earth at the time; others say it was because he didn't know how to allow for the fact that every bit of Earth was pulling at the Moon from slightly different dis-

tances and angles. He needed a mathematical tool that would help him solve that problem.

In 1669 he began working on such a tool, a mathematical technique that came to be called calculus. This was a more versatile technique than anything invented earlier, and science could not do without it these days. Calculus is the beginning of higher mathematics.

Working on the calculus at roughly the same time as Newton was a German mathematician, Gottfried Wilhelm Leibniz (1646—1716). Both he and Newton worked out the technique—Newton, perhaps, a little sooner—but Leibniz ended with a better symbolism.

This is not unusual. Frequently two scientists working independently come up with the same answers in response to the same problems. Often the solution is to give them joint credit. Sometimes, however, there are arguments about which scientist was really first, and this may even degenerate into accusations of plagiarism.

That is what happened this time. Exacerbated by national prejudices, English versus German, there was a Homeric battle that poisoned the scientific community for years without ever settling anything. Today, Newton and Leibniz are given joint credit for the caleulus.

1669,Phosphorus,"['Hennig Brand', 'Brand']","['German', 'Greek']","Of the substances chemists now consider to be elements, nine were known to the ancients. These included seven metals: gold, silver, copper, tin, iron, lead, and mercury; and two nonmetals: carbon and sulfur. Four more elements were probably known and were unmistakably described by the medieval alchemists: arsenic, antimony, bismuth, and zinc. We do not know who first discovered any of these elements, or when.

The situation changed when the German chemist Hennig Brand (d. ca. 1692) began searching for something that would enable him to create gold. For some reason, he thought he would find it in urine. He did not succeed in making

gold, but perhaps as early as 1669, he obtained a white waxy substance that glowed faintly in the air and which he therefore called phosphorus (from Greek words meaning “light-bearer”’). The faint glow was due to the spontaneous combustion of phosphorus in air.

All the ninety or so elements discovered after 1669 can be attributed to a specific person and a specific time. Brand’s discovery of phosphorus is the first of which this can be said.

1669,Fossils,"['God', 'Nicolaus Steno']","['Agricola', 'Satan', 'Noah', 'Danish']","The word fossil is from a Latin word meaning “to dig.” At first anything that could be dug out of the earth was called a fossil. The word came to be applied, however, to those particular objects that were dug up and that, although made of rock, seemed remarkably like remnants of living things—bones and teeth particularly. Agricola (see 1556) had commented on these over a century earlier.

There were numerous theories about these fossils. Some thought them prac-

tice attempts by God to create living things. Some thought them failing attempts of Satan to imitate God. Some thought them the remains of animals that had drowned in Noah's Flood.

In 1669, however, the Danish geologist Nicolaus Steno (1636—1686) maintained that they were the remains of creatures that had lived long ago and whose remains had slowly petrified; that is, been converted into stone. This view gradually prevailed, and fossils were to be the most spectacular (though far from being the only) evidence in favor of biological evolution.

1669,Double Refraction,"['Erasmus Bartholin', 'Bartholin', 'Bartholin Bartholin']","['Danish', 'Iceland']","Sometimes a discovery is s0 puzzling it must simply be put aside until science advances to the point where an explanation is possible.

Thus, in 1669 a Danish physician, Erasmus Bartholin (1625-1698), obtained a transparent crystal of a type now called Iceland spar. Bartholin noted that objects viewed through the crystal appeared double. It

was as though some light were refracted by the crystal through one angle, with the rest refracted through a slightly different angle. The phenomenon was therefore called double refraction.

Bartholin further noticed that when he rotated the crystal, one of the images remained fixed and the other revolved about it.

Bartholin could not explain these observations, and neither could anyone else. The observations had to remain in suspended animation for a century and a half until enough was known about light for an explanation to become possible.

1670,Blood Color,['Richard Lower'],['English'],"It was clear that blood went to the lungs to pick up air, and it was suspected that this must involve a chemical change in the blood. The first to notice evidence to that effect was an English physician, Richard Lower (1631-1691). In 1669 he noted that dark blood drawn from veins turned bright red on contact with air. The necessary details concerning the change had to wait another century, however.

Of these, the most important is diabetes, a disor-

der in which the patient is unable to process sugar in the normal way. Sugar in a diabetic tends to accumulate in the blood and spill over into the urine.

Some of the ancient physicians may have been aware that the urine of diabetics was sweet, where normal urine was not. It may be that flies collecting about diabetic urine gave the first hint.

It was the English physician Thomas Willis (1621-1675) who in 1670 was the first modern to point out the sweetness. Naturally, recognizing and understanding symptoms is a step toward learning how to treat a disease, but where diabetes was concerned the treatment didn’t come for a century and a

Huygens (see 1656), in an uncharacteristic mo-

ment of mysticism, thought that the six satellites matched the six planets in number (Mercury, Venus, Earth, Mars, Jupiter, and Saturn), which balanced things, so that no further satellite discoveries were to be expected.

Cassini (see 1665) blew that view to smithereens in 1671 when he discovered a

second satellite of Saturn, which he named Iapetus. Over the next thirteen years he discovered three more: Rhea, Dione, and Tethys. These names are those of Titans: Iapetus was a brother of Saturn (Cronos), while the other three were among his sisters.

Since then, no further heavenly distance had been determined accurately. The parallaxes of all other heavenly bodies were far too small to measure with the unaided eye, and the telescopes weren't quite good enough to do the job. However, Kepler's elliptical orbits and his three laws of planetary motion had made it possible to build a model of the Solar System in the proper proportions. If any planetary distance could be obtained, then all the other distances would be known too. Cassini (see 1665) tack-

led the job. Thinking his telescope might be good enough if he viewed Mars from two places sufficiently far apart, he sent another French astronomer, Jean Richer (1630-1696), to Cayenne in French Guiana on the northern shore of South America.

In 1672 Cassini determined the position of Mars against the stars as seen from Paris and, using the position of Mars as given in reports from Cayenne, worked out the parallax of Mars. That gave him the distance between Mars and Earth at that time, and from that he could calculate the other distances of the Solar System.

From his figures, he determined that the Sun was 87,000,000 miles from the Earth, as compared with the 5,000,000-mile distance

that Aristarchus (see 280 B.C.) had estimated. Cassini's estimate was 7 percent too low, but for a first try it was amazingly close.

For the first time, an appropriate idea of the size of the Solar System was obtained. Even allowing for the slightly low figure Cassini had, it was clear that the orbit of Saturn, which was then the farthest known planet, had to be over 1,600,000,000 miles across.

The stars must be farther still. No one yet knew how much farther the stars must be, but Cassini gave human beings the first shocking realization of how small they and their world were compared to the Universe. There were other and greater shocks yet to come.

Speed of light

At this time, nobody knew how quickly light traveled. Galileo (see 1581) had tried to measure it by standing on top of one hill and having a friend stand on top of another, each with dark lanterns. Galileo would reveal the flame in his lantern and at once his friend would reveal the flame in his. The time it took between Galileo’s sending the light and seeing the return light would be the time it took light to make the round trip. However, the time was always the same, no matter how far apart the hills were, and Galileo realized that he was just measuring

his friend’s reaction time and gave up. Light obviously moved too swiftly for its speed to be measured in that way. (There were those who thought it moved with infinite speed.)

In 1675, however, a Danish astronomer, Olaus Roemer (1644—1710), was carefully observing the motions of Jupiter’s satellites from the Paris Observatory, including the time when they passed behind Jupiter and were eclipsed. Cassini (see 1665) had timed those motions carefully and Roemer was checking them. To Roemer’s surprise, he found that the eclipses came progressively earlier at those times of the year

when Earth was approaching Jupiter in its orbit and progressively later when Earth was receding from Jupiter.

Roemer supposed this might be because light did not travel at infinite speeds but took longer to go from Jupiter to Earth when Earth was on the opposite side of the Sun from Jupiter, and less time when Earth was on the same side. From these time differences, Roemer calculated that light must travel at a speed of about 141,000 miles per second. This is only about three-fourths of its actual speed, but for a first determination it's not bad.  Saturn’s Rings

The north celestial pole is high in the sky as seen from Europe and the Middle East, and the stars near it, in their daily circle about it, never dip below the horizon.

On the other hand, the south celestial pole, along with the stars near it, are never above the horizon as seen from Europe.

As a result, the southernmost sky remained unknown to European astronomers till the Age of Exploration began. During Magellan's voyage, when they were off the shores of southern South America, the sailors saw two hazy clouds that looked like detached portions of the

Milky Way. They are called the Magellanic Clouds to . A bright star configuration, the Southern Cross, was also reported. No systematic astronomical observations of the far southern skies were made, however, until the English astronomer Edmond Halley (1656—1742) traveled to the island of St. Helena in the south Atlantic Ocean. There he spent two years, and despite bad weather that severely limited astronomical observations, he returned in 1678 to publish a catalog of 341 southern stars that astronomers had, until then, known nothing about.

Huygens (see 1656), on the other hand, insisted that light consisted of waves of the same type as sound (so-called longitudinal waves, which wave in and out in the same direction the waves are traveling). As to what was waving, Huygens supposed that there was a very subtle fluid in the vacuum of space (this came to be referred to by Aristotle’s term aether), which could not be detected in any ordinary way.

Neither Newton's particles nor Huygen's longitudinal waves could explain Bartholin’s observation of double refraction nine years before, but that was ignored. The controversy continued to rage.

In 1679 the French physicist Denis Papin (1647-21712) developed the pressuire cooker, a vessel with a tightly fitted lid in which water was boiled and the accumulated steam created a pressure that raised water’s boiling point. At this higher tem-

perature, bones softened and meat cooked faster than usual. A safety valve was included in case the steam pressure got too high. Papin cooked a meal for the Royal Society in his device and prepared one for Charles I as well.

life and nonlife alike. Generally, over the last three centuries, victory has come to the latter group.

Thus, in 1680 the Italian physiologist Giovanni Alfonso Borelli (1608—-1679) posthumously published a book, De Motu Animalium (Concerning Animal Motion), in which he successfully explained muscular action on a mechanical

basis, describing the actions of bones and muscles in terms of a system of levers. The laws that applied to inanimate levers also applied to our bone-muscle systems. (Of course, the bone-muscle action is one of the simplest aspects of life. Things got much more difficult as scientists tried to deal with the more complex aspects of life.)  1681

In 1598 the Dutch settled it and named it after Maurice of Nassau (see

1586). The Dutch stayed, on and off, till 1710.

Mauritius had forms of life that had evolved in isolation and that were different from forms elsewhere. For example, there was the dodo, a flightless pigeon, larger than a turkey and with a huge hooked bill. It

was harmless and unafraid (hence its name, perhaps) since there was nothing on Mauritius to threaten it. Once settlers arrived, however, they and their domestic animals began to kill this inoffensive bird. This continued until the very last dodo died about

1680. Similar birds on nearby islands were also killed off. Now we have the expression “dead as a dodo.”

It is hard to believe, nowadays, that such an unusual and interesting form

of life should have been slaughtered so casually, with no attempt made to save a few, but it has happened over and over again. It is one of the brighter aspects of recent history that human bei are now des-

fifth and sixth days, God is described as specifically creating animal life and instructing it to multiply. (Even today, vegetarians announce that their love of living things keeps them from eating animal food, although the plant life they eat is every bit as alive.) Some of this disdain for plant life was broken

down, in 1682, by the English botanist Nehemiah Grew (1641-1712), who showed that plants reproduced sexually, that they had sexual organs, and that individual grains of pollen were the equivalent of the sperm cells of the animal'’s world.

the distance of a star from the zenith at different places. With telescopes, that was the more accurate method, and Picard calculated the Earth's circumference as 24,876 miles and its diameter as 7,900 miles, figures that are very close to the best we have today.

1686,Imaginary Numbers,"['Mark', 'Mark Descartes']",[],"Mathematicians knew that ‘ the multiplication of two

negative numbers yields a positive product. Thus, not only does +1 x +1 = +1, but -1 x —1 = +1. What number, then, multiplied

by itself yields —1? To put

it another way, what is the square root of —1? Mathematicians can invent the necessary number, call it an imaginary number, and symbolize it as i for  imaginary. You can then say that +i X +i= —1. What's more, —i X ~i = —1.

Wallis (see 1668) succeeded in making sense out of such imaginary numbers in 1685.

Imagine a horizontal line. Mark off a point as zero and then imagine the positive numbers marked off to the right and the negative numbers marked off to the left, with all the fractions and irrational num-

bers appropriately marked off between the whole numbers. That is the real number axis.

Next, draw a vertical line passing through the zero point. Mark all the i numbers (i, 2i, 3i, and so on) upward, and all the —i numbers downward, with all the imaginary fractions and irrational numbers marked off, too. That is the imaginary number axis.

Every point in the plane can then be marked

off just as Descartes did in his analytical geometry (see 1637). Every point (a) on the real number axis becomes a + 0i; every point (b) on the imaginary number axis becomes 0 + bi; and every number on neither axis (the complex numbers) becomes a + bi.

Such a scheme proved enormously useful to mathematicians, scientists, and engineers.

These seasonal winds were called mon-

soons, from an Arabic word meaning ‘‘season.” There were also the steady trade winds that blew southwestward north of the equator and northwestward south of the equator.

The first person to try to make world sense out of the winds was Halley (see 1678), who in 1686 wrote a book on the subject. It included a world map that

showed the prevailing winds over the tropic oceans—the monsoons and trade winds. Halley did not have quite the proper explanation for the winds, however. He knew they involved the rising of sunheated air but did not understand the reason for the westward flow of tropical air.  Plant Classification

There is a natural tendency for people interested in natural history to classify animals and plants. Aristotle (see 350 B.c., Animal Classification) classified the former, and Theophrastus (see 320 B.c.) classified the latter. The ancients, however,

had limited access to living things because so much of the world was beyond their ken.

The first to do a modern job of classification was an English naturalist, John Ray (1627-1705). Starting in 1686, he published what eventually came to be a painstaking three-volume classification of 18,600 different plant species. While

such work might seem to be mere listing, the basis for the classification requires a good deal of ingenuity, and on the whole, Ray made good decisions in these matters. Classifications such as his made the matter of biological evolution seem an overwhelming

likelihood

It was clear that the Sun had to attract the planets somehow, but what was the attraction and how did it work?

A number of scientists got pretty close to what

turned out to be the truth, notably Hooke (see 1657), who was a great enemy of Newton (see 1666). When Hooke boasted to Halley (see 1678), who was a great friend of Newton, that he (Hooke) had the answer. Halley went to Newton to check the matter with him. Newton said that he had worked out the answer in 1666 (see 1669, Calculus) but had never published it. Halley, in great excitement urged publication.

Newton could do this

now with much greater confidence than he could have done it twenty years earlier. For one thing, he now had calculus, which made some calculations easy that would have been difficult before. For another, he had Picard’s figures on the Earth's size (see 1684), and accuracy in that respect was necessary to his calculations.

Newton took eighteen months to write the bock and, in 1687, published Philosophiae Naturalis Prin

cipia Mathematica (Mathematical Principles of Natural Philosophy), often known simply as the Principia. It was written in Latin and did not appear in English until 1729.Tt is generally considered the greatest science book ever written.

Despite the greatness of the book, Newton had trouble publishing it. Hooke was unalterably opposed, and the Royal Society hesitated to become involved in the controversy. Fortunately, Halley had inherited a fortune in 1684, when his father was murdered by unknown assailants. He saw to the proofreading of the book and had it published at his OWN expense.

In the book, Newton codified Galileo’s findings concerning falling bodies (see 1589) into the three laws of motion.

The first enunciated the principle of inertia: A body at rest remains at rest and a body in motion remains in motion at a constant velocity (that is, constant speed in a constant direction) as long as outside forces are not involved.

The second law of motion defines force as the product of mass and acceleration. This was the first clear distinction between the mass of a body (representing its resistance to ac-

celeration) and its weight (representing the extent to which it is acted on by a gravitational force),

The third law of motion states that for every action there is an equal and opposite reaction.

These laws of motion are equivalent to the axioms and postulates with which Euclid began his treatment of geometry, From the axioms and postulates, an incredible number of theorems can be derived, each one building on theorems that went before. In the same way, from the laws of motion, an enormous number of mechanical effects can be deduced.

"
1687,Universal Gravitation,"['Kepler', 'Newton', 'De', 'Newton Newton']","['Newton', 'Newton Newton']","From the laws of motion, Newton was able to deduce the manner in which the gravitational force of attraction between the Earth and the Moon could be calculated. He showed that it was directly proportional to the product of the masses of the two bodies and inversely proportional to the square of the distance between their centers. The proportionality could be made an equality by the introduction of a constant. In other words:

F = gmm'/d? where g is the gravitational

constant, m and m' are the masses of the Earth and the Moon, d is the distance between their centers, and F is the force of gravitational attraction between them. Most important of all, Newton postulated that this law of gravitational attraction held not only between the Earth and the Moon, but between any two bodies at all throughout the Universe. It was not merely gravitation he was speaking of, but universal gravitation. This was another claim that the laws of nature were the same everywhere and the mightiest blow yet against the view that the heavenly bodies worked by some set of natural laws other than those that prevailed on Earth. From this rather simple law of universal gravitation, all of Kepler’s laws of planetary motion could be derived. It accounted for all the irregularities of planetary motion known in Newton'’s time, for while the Sun was the predominant attractive body, the planets had minor attractions for each other that resulted in slight alterations (perturbations) of their orbits from what they would be if the Sun alone were involved. What Newton had done was to describe the machinery of the Universe effectively and to show that it was essentially simple. De

spite the fact that forces other than gravitation are known today, and that Newton’s description of gravitation has been refined since, it still remains true that gravitation is the overriding force that controls the great sweeps of the Universe, and that Newton’s formulation is an excellent one if distances and velocities are not too great.

While there, Richer had found that a pendulum beat more slowly than it did in Paris, so that a clock that would

have been correct in Paris lost two and a half minutes a day in Cayenne.

Newton pointed out that this could be so if the force of gravity were slightly weaker in Cayenne than in Paris or if Cayenne were farther from the Earth’s center than Paris was. Since Cayenne, like Paris, was at sea level, the conclusion was that sea level must itself be higher at Cayenne than at Paris.

Newton showed that if a body rotated, a centrifugal effect would act to counter gravitation to a certain extent and that this countering force would be zero at the poles and grow stronger and stronger as one moved away from the poles until it reached a maximum at the Equator. The centrifugal effect would, in other words, give

rise to an equatorial bulge, which would make the diameter across the Equator somewhat longer than the diameter from pole to pole

Jupiter and Saturn, which are much larger than Earth, spin much faster and are, in addition, made of lighter material. In their cases, the equatorial bulges are so great that their orbs look clearly elliptical rather than circular. Earth’s outline drawn from pole to pole and back would also be slightly elliptical (though not noticeably so to the unaided eye). Instead of being almost perfectly spherical as the Sun and Moon are, Earth would be an oblate spheroid according to Newton's reasoning. (Of course, the matter would have to be checked by actual measurement eventually.)

1698,Miner’s Friend,"['Thomas Savery', 'Savery', 'Friend']","['England', 'England English', 'Guericke']","England, short of wood, turned increasingly to coal, but coal mines in England’s damp climate tended to fill with water, and the water had to be pumped out at the cost of much labor, in volving both human and animal muscle.

An English engineer, Thomas Savery (1650?— 1715), knew of the power of the vacuum as demonstrated by Guericke (see 1645). It occurred to him that one could create a vacuum by filling a vessel with hot steam and then cooling it so that the steam turned to a few drops of water. If the vessel were connected to a tube reaching down into the water at the bottom of the mine, the water could be sucked up as much as 33 feet (see 1643). It could then be blown out by more steam, which would fill the vessel —and be cooled again to

suck up another batch of water.

Savery built such pumps in 1698 and called them the Miner's Friend. A few even came to be used. However, they made use of high-pressure steam, and the technology of the day was not able to handle such steam safely. Besides, it took a great deal of fuel to heat water to form the necessary steam, and most of the coal obtained with the help of the Miner's Friend had to be used in operating the device.

Nevertheless, Savery's pump got people to thinking about using steam power, and much was to come of that.

1699,Scientific Voyages,"['Columbus', 'Magellan']",['Halley'],"Voyages undertaken for exploration, settlement, or trade might also produce scientific knowledge as a

side effect, as Columbus’s first voyage did when he observed magnetic declination (see 1492), or Magellan’s when the Magellanic Clouds were observed (see 1678). In 1698, however, an ocean voyage was undertaken, for the first time, that was for the specific purpose of scientific investigation and nothing more.

The ship was the Paramour Pink and it was under the command of Halley (see 1678). He remained at sea for two years, measured magnetic declinations all over the world, and prepared the first map of the world showing the wiggling lines of equal declination. He also did his best to determine accurate latitudes and longitudes for the various ports he stopped at.

1699,Gas Volume and Temperature,"['Galileo', 'Thi', 'Amontons']",['French'],"icist Guil-

The French pt laume Amontons (1663—

1705) devised an air thermometer that was different from Galileo’s (see 1592), for it measured temperature by the change in gas pressure rather than by the

change in gas volume. He used the thermometer to show that a liquid such as water always boiled at the same temperature. Thi made it possible to use the temperature at which water boiled as a standard reference.

With his new thermometer, Amontons tested the volume of a fixed quantity of gas at different tempera-

tures and, in 1 , showed that the volume inc at a steady rate as th perature went up and decreased at the same steady rate as the temperatur went down. Much more important, he showed that for he studied, the volume change with temperature was the same. It seemed a property of all

gases.  1700

There is, however, nothing magic about the figure 10. Instead of units, tens, hundreds

(10 x 10s), thousands (10 X 10 x 10s), and so on, we could have units, eights, sixty-fours (8 x 8s), five-

hundred-twelves (8 x 8

X 8s), and so on, or ones, seventeens, two-hundredeighty-nines (17 x 17s), four-thousand-ninehundred-thirteens (17 x 17 % 17s), and so on—or any number.

This was pointed out by Leibniz (see 1669, Calculus) about 1700. Some bases for positional notation are, of course, more convenient than others.

Using the base 12 or 8 each has some advantages over 10. Leibniz also showed that the binary system based on 2 had its uses. Its positions were units, twos, fours, eights, sixteens, and s0 on. The only symbeols it needed were 1 and 0. The binary system is particularly useful for modern computers.

The Age of Reason (1701—-1780)

By the beginning of the eighteenth century, science had become separated from theology, and investigation, experimentation, and discovery were the order of the day. Society was in the grip of a euphoria that grew out of a widely held confidence in the scientific method, which became identified with human progress. Public interest in knowledge was strong enough by mid-century to support publication of Denis Diderot’s Encyclopedia, a categorized summary of information that was the first of its kind. The design of experiments was refined, and both results and the language used to report them became more precise. Greater emphasis was placed on confirmation by independent investigators; the growth of the scientific societies born in the 1600s fostered the publication of findings, discussion, and general support for their members’ work. Some of the most stunning achievements of the period were in chemistry. For his work establishing the importance of quantitative measurement, Antoine-Laurent Lavoisier is remembered as

the father of modern chemistry. In the 1770s, using recent findings of Joseph Priestley, Lavoisier determined that the newly isolated gas oxygen was one of two main components of air and the key element in combustion. Joseph Black’s discovery of carbon dioxide in 1754 had led to the realization that air was a combination of different gases, and in 1766 Henry Cavendish isolated hydrogen and determined that it had a very low density. Other elements were discovered, including cobalt, platinum, nickel, manganese, chlorine, and molybdenum. In 1735 Carolus Linneaus published his Systems of Nature, which classified European plants (and, in later editions, animals) so skillfully that he is called the father of modern taxonomy. A German botanist explained plant pollination for the first time in 1763, and a Dutch experimenter discovered photosynthesis in 1779.In 1729 Stephen Gray, who thought that electricity was a fluid, showed that it could travel through glass, twine, and other conductors. Experimenters in 1745 were (liter-

ally) shocked to learn that electricity could be stored in what came to be called a Leyden jar. In 1752 Benjamin Franklin flew a kite in a thunderstorm in a successful attempt to prove that natural electricity and the electricity generated in a Leyden jar were one and the same. Several technological advances of this period foreshadowed the Industrial Revolution. The flying shuttle, introduced in 1733, allowed partial mechanization of the weaving process and greatly increased the productivity of textile workers. When Richard Arkwright devised the spinning frame in 1769, even unskilled workers could produce woven cloth much more quickly. In

1709 the process of ironsmelting was improved through the use of cokefired furnaces. In 1764 James Watt improved on Newcomen's steam engine of 1712 when he built a double-chambered system, the first such device that worked reasonably well. It was Watt's next improvement on the steam engine that took history into a radically new phase.  1705

"
1699,Comets’ Orbits,"['Once Newton', 'Principia', 'Earth', 'Halley']","['Halley', 'Halley Saturn']","For a century or more, astronomers had been trying to puzzle out the orbits of comets. It was clear that comets’ orbits were nothing at all like those of the planets. Some astronomers thought comets’ passed through the Solar System in a straight line. Others thought they passed through in parabolas— coming in from far-off space, going around the Sun and out forever.

Once Newton's Principia was published, however (see 1687), it seemed to many that comets had to be bound by gravitation as the planets were.

Halley (see 1678), in an attempt to prove that this was so, began collecting data on comets. Eventually, when he had listed the movements of two dozen comets, he was struck by the similarity of the path

across the sky of the 1682 comet (which he himself had observed) with the paths of the comets that had appeared in 1607, 1531, and 1456. These four had come at intervals of seventy-five or seventy-six years. It seemed to Halley that it must be the same comet, returning regularly.

If that were so, a comet would have an orbit that was an ellipse, just as Earth'’s orbit was, but the cometary ellipse would be extremely elongated. At one end, the comet would approach close to the Sun; at the other, it would recede far beyond Saturn, the farthest known planet.

Halley predicted, in a book written in 1705, that this same comet would return about 1758 and that it would cross the sky in the same path as in 1682. He was aware, he said, that the gravitational influence of the planets might alter the

orbit somewhat and change the time of appearance a little.

Halley's claim was not taken seriously at the time, but it did rouse additional interest in comets.

1707,Plant Nourishment,"['Stephen Hales', 'Helmont', 'Hales', 'Springs All']",['English'],"The English physiologist Stephen Hales (1677-1761) began experiments on plants in 1705. His most important suggestion was that air contributed to the nourishment of plants, thus correcting Helmont's misconception of a century before to the effect that only water counted (see 1624).

Hales was the first person to collect gases by bubbling them through water and trapping them in an upside-down vessel.

. Carriage

. Springs All conveyances, from sedan chairs to carriages, were subject to the unevennesses of the road, jolting passengers as every projection or rut was encountered. It was not till 1706 that springs were used in carriages to absorb some of the shock. To be sure, this induced swaying, which has its unpleasantness, too, but is undoubtedly prefera-

ble to the lurchings and bangings that existed before springs. The devising of ever-more-efficient springs and, just as important, smoother roads gave land transportation less the feeling of being a devil’s playground.

"
1712,Coke and Iron,"['Coke', 'Abraham Darby', 'Great Britain', 'Great Britain Rifling']","['England', 'British', 'Pennsylvania', 'Dutch', 'German']","Iron ore had required the carbon and the high temperatures of burning charcoal ever since ironsmelting had begun over three thousand years before (see 1000 B.c.). In England, however, the price of charcoal was climbing out of sight as the forests dwindled. Coke had been produced for half a century or more but its use in iron-

smelting had not been worked out.

The British ironworks master Abraham Darby (1678-1717) made the first successful use of coke in iron-smelting in 1709. In fact, he found that lumps of coke were stronger than lumps of charcoal and could support a larger charge of iron ore, so that iron could actually be produced at a faster rate. A larger furnace meant more

draft and a hotter fire so that iron production was improved still further.

In short, Great Britain was now producing the best and most iron in the world, and since iron could be used for building machinery of all kinds, thanks to its combination of strength and cheapness, Great Britain was set for what would be called the Industrial Revolution.

o Rifle

If the muzzle of a gun is rifled—that is, outfitted with spiral grooves—the bullet is set to spinning, and a spinning bullet can be aimed with greater precision. Rifling was tried from the early days of gunnery, but rifling requires a greater force to push the bullet through the muzzle, which means that guns

have to be better constructed and are harder to reload. On the whole, the smooth-bore muzzles of muskets seemed better. About 1710 or soon thereafter, however, the Pennsylvania rifle was designed by the Pennsylvania Dutch (not Dutch, really, but German immigrants). The Pennsylvania rifle took twice as long to reload as the musket, but it had

two to three times the range and much greater accuracy. As long as soldiers fought with muskets, they had to maintain a straight line, and all had to shoot at once in the general direction of the enemy, hoping that by sheer luck some bullets would strike home. If they fought soldiers with rifles, the rifles could pick them off before they could even get in musket range.

1713,Newcomen Steam Engine,"['Savery', 'Miner', 'Friend', 'Thomas Newcomen']","['English', 'Newcomen']","The use of coke for iron smelting (see 1709) in-

creased the demand for coal out of which to make coke, and that meant there

was a greater need for some

device to pump water out of the coal mines. Savery’s

Miner’s Friend was too inefficient and too dangerous. In 1712 an English engineer, Thomas Newcomen (1663—-1729), devised a new kind of steam engine. It

didn’t depend on using steam to form a vacuum that would suck water upward and then using highpressure steam to blow it out, Newcomen's engine used ordinary low-pressure steam to push a piston. That meant the pistons didn’t have to fit as tightly

as they must when highpressure steam is used, and it meant the machine was less dangerous.

Newcomen engines proved quite popular, but they were still terribly inefficient. Most of the heat of the burning fuel went into heating the chamber till

water boiled into steam and pushed the piston. Then the chamber was cooled to let the piston move back, after which the chamber had to be refilled with water and heated all over again for another forward thrust.

1714,Smallpox Inoculation,"['Smallpox', 'Smallpox Lady Mary Wortley Montagu']","['English', 'British', 'Turkey', 'Turkey Russian']","Smallpox was the dread disease of this time. The plague, which had been the enormous danger of the last half of the 1300s (see 1346), still struck, but only in isolated places and briefly, and was never again quite the universal danger it had been in the earlier period, perhaps because human beings had gained greater immunity. Smallpox, however, was increasing, and the great dread it in-

spired was not merely because it frequently killed, but because even when it did not, it disfigured. The large puckered pockmarks it would form left faces visions of ugliness.

If one survived smallpox, h()\.\’L’\'f'r, one was Safe from a second attack. A patient would only get it once. What's more, some smallpox cases were rather mild, didn’t kill, and only slightly disfigured, but the mild cases led to immunity against a second attack just as efficiently as severe cases did. It followed that a mild

case of smallpox was actually better than none at all.

The reasoning, then, was that if you knew someone with a mild case of smallpox, you might get close to him or her in the hope that you would catch a case just as mild.

In 1713, in fact, the English poet Lady Mary Wortley Montagu (1689— 1762), whose husband was a British ambassador to Turkey and who accompanied him there, brought back the news that in Turkey they were actually inoculating people with pus  from the pustules of people with mild cases, to make sure that the inoculated person would get it. The only trouble with that was that you couldn’t always tell—what was a mild case

in one person might prove to be a severe one, even a deadly one, in the person being inoculated. It was very much like playing Russian roulette.

Nevertheless, such was

the fear of smallpox that, for over three-fourths of a century, many people submitted to such inoculation (also called variolation from variola, the medical term for smallpox).

1715,Mercury Thermometer,"['Ferdinand II', 'Daniel Gabriel Fahrenheit', 'Mercury', 'Fahrenheit']","['Galileo', 'Amontons', 'German', 'United States']","As long as thermometers were open to the air, like those of Galileo (see 1592) and Amontons (see 1699), they were affected by air pressure in one way or another and were always limited in accuracy. The first person to devise a closed thermometer was Ferdinand II de’ Medici (1610— 1670), who did so in 1654. At first, sealed ther-

mometers used water or alcohol or mixtures of the two, but these fluids produced vapors that introduced pressure effects. What's more, water didn't expand and contract as evenly with temperature as was needed for good precision, while alcohol boiled at too low a temperature. The German physicist Daniel Gabriel Fahrenheit (1686-1736) worked with alcohol thermometers at first, but in 1714 he made the key advance of using

mercury. Mercury stays liguid between quite low temperatures and quite high temperatures, produces very little vapor, and expands and contracts quite evenly with temperature change. It is an ideal fluid for thermometers and is still commonly used for the purpose today.

Fahrenheit made another advance toward the setting of good standard temperatures. He noted the height of the mercury column in a mixture of ice,  water, and ammonium chloride, which resulted in the lowest temperature he could get, and he called that 0. A mixture of ice and water he set at 32, and the

temperature of boiling water was then 212. This is the Fahrenheit scale, and it is still commonly used in the United States to mea-

sure temperature.

The Fahrenheit thermometer was the first that could measure temperature with sufficient accuracy to be useful to scientists.

1715,Solar Eclipse,"['Great Britain', 'Thales', 'Halley']","['Europe', 'Halley']","On April 22, 1715, a solar eclipse was to take place and the path of totality was to cross Great Britain and parts of Europe. It had been twenty-three centuries since Thales had predicted an eclipse (see 585 B.c.) and it was perfectly understood by astronomers that

eclipses were phenomena that were natural, harmless, and splendid. Nevertheless, superstition is immortal, and in order to prevent as much panic as possible, Halley (see 1678) carefully plotted out the path the eclipse would take and prepared maps of it well in adyance so that everyone knew exactly

when he or she would see the Sun lose its light. Halley also organized a large number of observers throughout Europe to watch and time the eclipse. This was the first eclipse for which astronomers turned out en masse. From this point on, every eclipse would bring its crowd of observing astronomers.  1718

1715,Stellar Motion,"['Moon', 'Earth', 'Sirius', 'Tycho', 'Halley']","['Sumerian', 'Procyon', 'Arcturus', 'Greek', 'Greeks']","Ever since the motion of the Sun, Moon, and planets relative to the stars generally had been discovered in Sumerian times, the chief

quality of the thousands of remaining stars in the sky had seemed to be that they did not move relative to each other. They were designated as the fixed stars

fixed to the solid firmament

of the sky, that is—w hlle

the various planets ci

Earth below the firmament. In 1718, however, Hal-

ley (see 1678) determined

the position of the bright stars Sirius, Procyon, and Arcturus and observed that they had changed their position markedly since Greek times. They had even changed position perceptibly since the time of T Brahe (see 1572)

It didn’t seem possible that the Greeks had made mistakes that large in recording their data, and it was even less possible that Tycho had made such mistakes. Halley therefore concluded that the stars were not fixed but moving. It was because they were so

distant that their “proper motions” were too small to ob ¢ until they

mulated over extended periods of time.

With Halley, then, tt firmament—the solid vault of the sky that everyone had accepted till then, ar that even had the authority of the Bib did not exist. The stars e, rather, like a swarm of very distant and widely spread-out bees, each moving at its own speed and in its own direction.  1722

In 1722 the Dutch navigator Jacob Roggeveen (1659— 1729) came across a small island, 45 square miles in area, that was one of the

most isolated bits of land in the world. It was 1,200 miles from the nearest land, which was another small island like itself. Since the island was sighted on Easter Sunday, it was named Passeisland in Dutch, or Easter Island in English.

Easter Island was probably the farthest point reached by the Polynesians

in their settlement of the Pacific Islands (see 1642). The island is best known for six hundred stone statues of a type found nowhere else. This has lent the island an air of mystery that it probably doesn’t deServe.

Later in the same voyage, Roggeveen discovered the Samoan Islands.

"
1728,Ship’s Chronometer,"['John Harrison', 'Harrison']","['British', 'English']","If a ship wants to locate itself on the ocean, it can measure its latitude (the

distance north or south of the equator) by taking the position of the Sun at maximum height or the position of the North Star and calculating the distance of either from the zenith. To mea-

sure a ship’s longitude (the distance east or west of its home port), however, can be done accurately only if the exact time is known, which presented a problem at this time. A pendulum

clock would obviously fail to work on the swaying deck of a ship, and the watches of the time were insufficiently accurate.

In 1714 the British government offered a prize of twenty thousand pounds, an incredible fortune in those days, to anyone who would devise a method of determining a ship’s longitude. The sum was clearly worth it, to be sure, considering the improvement it would make in a ship’s ability to navigate accurately and the profits that would result from accelerated trade.

Beginning in 1728, an English instrument-maker, John Harrison (1693—1776), built a series of five clocks, each one better than the one before. Each clock was so mounted that it could take the sway of a ship without being adversely affected. He designed a pendulum of different metals so that it would stay the same length and give the same beat even as temperature changed. He also inserted a mechanism that would keep the clock going while it was being wound. Any one of Harrison's clocks met the demands of the prize conditions. In fact, they were more accurate at sea than any other clock then known was on land. One of Harrison's

chronometers was off by less than a minute after five months at sea.

The British parliament, however, put on an extraordinary display of miserliness in this connection. It put off the payment to Harrison for years, and he did not get the full amount until 1773.

1728,Aberration of Light,"['Copernicus', 'Copernicus Kepler', 'James Bradley', 'Bradley', 'Bradley Bradley', 'Roemer']","['British', 'Earth']","Since Copernicus’s book (see 1543) nearly two centuries before, the question of the parallax of the stars had bothered astronomers. If the Earth did indeed move about the Sun, that should induce a parallactic displacement among the nearer stars as compared with the farther ones. Viewing a nearby star from one side of the Sun and then viewing it again from the other side, 186,000,000 miles away, should produce a displacement—but it didn't.

Those who accepted Copernicus and Kepler felt this was because even the nearest stars were so far away that their parallax was too small to measure. Still, telescopes were constantly improving, so astronomers kept trying.

One of those who tried was a British astronomer,

James Bradley (1693~ 1762). Bradley, using a telescope 212 feet long, tried to measure the small displacement of stars in the course of the year and actually detected such a displacement. What he found, however, could not be parallax, because the displacement did not coincide with what would be expected if it were the result of Earth's changing position in its orbit.

Bradley looked for an alternate explanation and one occurred to him in 1728: The displacement arose because the telescope had to be tipped slightly to catch the light as the Earth moved (this is called adjusting to the aberration of light), just as an umbrella must be tipped when you're walking briskly through a rainstorm in which the drops are falling vertically. The amount by which the telescope must be tipped depends on the ratio of the speed of the Earth in its orbit to the speed of light.

This meant that although Bradley had not detected parallax, he had discovered a new way of calculating the speed of light, since the speed of the Earth in its orbit was known and the amount of the tipping of the telescope was known, too. This was the first determination of  the speed of light since

Roemer’s a half-century be-

fore (see 1675) and it was a more accurate measurement. Bradley’s figure was 176,000 miles per second, only 5 percent less than the true value.

What’s more, the existence of light aberration was just as strong a proof that the Earth was moving as the existence of stellar parallax would have been.

there was a land connection between Siberia and North America. Peter commissioned a Danish navigator, Vitus Jonassen Bering (1681-1741), to look into it.

In 1725 Bering crossed Siberia overland and reached Kamchatka, which he was the first to map. From Kamchatka, he sailed north in 1728 and reached the ice of the Arctic Ocean without sighting land. He had sailed through what is now known as the Bering Strait, which separates Siberia from Alaska. The sea to the south is the Bering Sea.

1733,Electrical Conductance,"['Hauksbee', 'Stephen Gray', 'Gray']","['English', 'Latin']","The interest in static elec-

(1666—1736), found that when he electrified a long glass tube, the corks at the end were also electrified even though they had not been touched. The electricity, whatever it was, had clearly traveled from the glass into the corks. Gray thought, therefore,

that electricity was a fluid.

He experimented further, causing the electrical fluid to travel through long stretches of twine (as long as 800 feet). He found that the fluid flowed more easily through some substances than through others. This  | led to the division of sub-

| stances into conductors and nonconductors. Nonconductors might also be

Newton had been convinced that a lens was bound to produce colors at the focus that would blur |  the image (see 1666). How| ever, an English mathematician, Chester Moor Hall (1703—1771), noticed something Newton had missed: different kinds of glass produced spectra of different widths. Flint glass (containing lead) produced a rather wider spectrum than crown glass (ordinary window glass) did.

Hall therefore decided to make a convex lens out | of crown glass and a concave lens out of flint glass, designed in such a way that the two would fit together to form a single biconvex lens. The crown glass would spread out the col-

ors, while the flint glass would bring them together again without neutralizing all the magnifying value of the crown glass. The end result was an achromatic (from Greek words meaning “'no color”) lens, which would magnify an object without producing colors.

Hall did not publicize his lens properly, and John Dollond (1706—1761), who prepared an achromatic lens in 1757, often gets the credit. In any case, the achromatic lens made it possible to use the entire lens and to have a short focal length, so that telescopes could be made shorter and more convenient—and better, too.

1733,Two Electrical Fluids,"['Cisternay', 'Fay']",['French'],"The French physicist Charles-Francois de Cisternay du Fay (1698—1739) was experimenting with static electricity as so many scientists were doing at this time. In 1733 he found that two bits of cork electrified by the same means repelled each other.

He found, however, that if one cork ball was electrified by means of an

electrified glass rod, and another by means of an electrified resin rod, the two cork balls attracted each other.

Du Fay decided there must be two electrical fluids and he called them vitreous (from a Latin word for “glass”) electricity and resinous electricity. One form of electricity attracted the other, but each repelled itself. This was similar to the well-known magnetic property that like poles repelled each other but unlike poles attracted each other. Thus began the process of detecting similarities and interconnections between

electricity and magnetism, which was to become par-

ticularly important a cen-

tury later.

1735,Flying Shuttle,['John Kay'],['British'],"In weaving, a shuttle, with the yarn (the woof) attached, must be led across a long series of other yarns (the warp), in and out, to form a strong textile material.

In 1733 a British machinist, John Kay (17041764), invented the flying shuttle, a device whereby the weaver, by pulling a cord, could activate a driver that would send the

shuttle flying across the loom. Pulling the cord in the opposite direction would send it on its return journey. The vertical

(warp) yarns were automatically separated so that the flying shuttle could pass quickly in and out through them.

This was one of the early examples of a factory process being mechanized so that one person could do more work much more quickly with far less effort. It pointed the way to the coming Industrial Revolution.

1735,Shape of the Earth,"['Universal Gravitation', 'La Condamine']","['Newton', 'French', 'French Peru', 'French Maupertuis', 'Lapland', 'Newton Sea', 'Europe', 'European', 'Orellana']","Newton had suggested that, on the basis of his gravitational theory, the Earth ought to be an oblate spheroid and have an equatorial bulge, because it was rotating (see 1687, Universal Gravitation). Plans were now being made to check this prediction by actual measurement.

If the polar regions were slightly flattened and the equatorial regions were slightly bulging, a degree of latitude near the poles should be slightly greater in mileage than a degree of latitude near the Equator. To see if that were so, two expeditions were sent out by the French in 1735. One, under the French geographer Charles-Marie de La Condamine (1701-1774), was sent to Peru, quite near the Equator. The other, under the French mathematician Pierre-Louis Moreau de Maupertuis (1698—1759), went to Lapland, which was about as close to the pole as Europeans could venture in those days.

The results, when finally achieved, completely

supported Newton. The degree of latitude was 1 percent longer near the poles than near the Equator, Sea level at the Equator, we now know, is 13 miles farther from the Earth'’s center than sea level at the poles.

Before returning to Europe, by the way, La Condamine explored the Amazon River region. This was the first time it had been explored in depth by a European since Orellana (see 1542), and La Condamine brought back the first rubber and curare to Europe.

1735,Taxonomy,"['Carl', 'Carolus Linnaeus', 'Always', 'Great Britain', 'Systema Naturae', 'Linnaeus', 'Linnaeus Linnaeus']","['Sweden', 'Scandinavia', 'Europe', 'Nature', 'Greek', 'Genesis']","Carl von Linné (1707— 1778), born in Sweden, is better known by the Latinized version of his name, Carolus Linnaeus. Always interested in plants, he traveled 4,600 miles through northern Scandinavia, where he discovered a hundred new species of plants. He also traveled through Great Britain and western Europe.

In 1735 he published Systema Naturae (Systemns of Nature), in which he classified numerous plants, ex-

tending the classification in later editions to animals.

Linnaeus was remarkable for the methodical way he went about his classifications. Similar species were grouped into genera (singular, genus); similar genera into classes; similar classes into orders. He described each species concisely and gave it a double name, genus and species (binomial nomenclature). Thus, he was the first to call human beings members of the species Homo sapiens.

Linnaeus's systematic process made him the father of modern taxonomy (from Greek words meaning “naming in order’""). What's more, his system of groups, groups of groups, groups of groups of groups, and so on gave his description of living things the appearance of a tree in which large branches divided into smaller branches, those into smaller still, until the final twigs were the species. This made the notion of biological evolution seem more natural than ever, but Linnaeus himself was strongly antievolution and clung to the tale in Genesis.

1736,Trade Winds,"['Halley', 'George Hadley']",['British'],"Half a century before, Halley had tried to explain the trade winds and monsoon but had missed one essential point (see 1686). The

British physicist George Hadley (1685-1768) now supplied it. He pointed out that air near the Equator had a faster west-to-east motion than air farther from the Equator. There-

fore, winds moving away from the Equator tended to drift eastward, while winds moving toward the Equator tended to drift westward. This view proved satisfactory.

sults by the use of calculus, he managed to put the proofs into geometric forms in his book.

In 1736, however, the Swiss mathematician Leonhard Euler (1707— 1783), the most prolific of

all time, wrote the first book—Mechanics—to be entirely devoted to that subject. In place of Newton'’s geometry, he made use of algebra and calculus whenever he could.

1738,Cobalt,"['Georg Brandt', 'Brandt', 'Cobalt', 'Brand']",['Swedish'],"It puzzled miners that a blue mineral resembling copper ore did not yield copper when smelted. The miners assumed it was copper ore that had been bewitched by kobolds—earth spirits who were thought to be malevolent at times. In 1737 a Swedish chemist, Georg Brandt (1694—-1768), investigated

the blue ore and managed to obtain a metal from it but one that was definitely not copper. Brandt gave it the name of the earth spirit, spelling it cobalt, and that is still the name of the element.

Cobalt was the first new element discovered since Brand’s discovery of phosphorus three-quarters of a century earlier (see 1669). Since phosphorus is

not a metal, cobalt was also the first metal to be discovered that was not known to the ancients or to the medieval alchemists,

Brandt was perhaps the first important chemist to be completely free of any alchemical taint, and after him the discovery of new elements continued till contemporary times.

1739,Kinetic Theory of Gases,"['Boyle', 'Daniel Bernoulli']","['Swiss', 'Greek']","Boyle had supposed gases to consist of widely spaced atoms, since that would account for the fact that gases could be compressed-(see 1662).

This notion was carried further by a Swiss mathematician, Daniel Bernoulli (1700—1782). He assumed that the atoms making up gases were always in rapid,

random movement, colliding with each other and with the walls of the containing vessel. (This is called the kinetic theory of gases; kinetic is from the Greek word for “motion."") If the temperature

rises, the atoms move faster

and collide harder and thus move a bit farther away from each other. For that reason, the volume increases as the temperature rises and decreases as the temperature falls, if pres-

sure remains the same. If the volume is kept from changing, then the pressure (the force with which the atoms hit the walls) increases as the temperature goes up and decreases as the temperature goes down.

This description turned out to be correct, but an adequate mathematical treatment of the subject did not arrive for another century and a quarter.

sembled a plant somewhat in appearance, but which Trembley showed to be an animal. It had tentacles,

1d seemed a tiny and harmless replica of the fearsome Hydra destroyed by Hercules in the Greek myths.

The resemblance was all the closer in that the mythical Hydra grew back heads that were lopped off and the tiny freshwater hydra could regenerate parts that were cut off. In fact, Trembley showed that if a hydra was cut in two,  each half could grow into a complete organism, and if two hydra were grafted together they would form a

single individual. This showed that such properties, thought to be exclusive to plants, clearly existed in

animals, loo, if the animals were sufficiently primitive

1742,Celsius Scale,[],"['Swedish', 'Celsius', 'Latin', 'Celsius United States']","For nearly thirty years, the Fahrenheit scale (see 1714) had been commonly used for temperature measurements. It had some disadvantages, however. For instance, the freezing point of water was set at 32 degrees, a curiously uneven number.

It makes a huge difference, both to scientists and to human beings generally, whether water is liquid or solid, whether a pond is frozen over or not, whether it snows or rains. In 1742, therefore, the Swedish astronomer Anders Celsius (1701-1744) suggested that the freezing point of water be set at 0 degrees, so that a positive reading meant water and a negative read-

ing meant ice. The boiling point of water would then be set at 100 degrees, rather than 212.

This new scale was at first called the Centigrade scale (from Latin words meaning “‘a hundred steps” —that is, from the freezing point to the boiling point of water), but this was converted to Celsius scale by international agreement in 1948. The entire world has now adopted the Celsius scale with only one significant exception—the United States.

1742,Goldbach’s Conjecture,"['Fermat', 'Fermat Christian Goldbach', 'Goldbach']","['German', 'Russia', 'Goldbach']","A mathematician who lhinks some statement seemns true but can't prove

it’s true may then advance it as a conjecture. Fermat'’s Last Theorem (see 1637) is not a conjecture; Fermat stated flatly that he had a proof—though he may have been mistaken, to be sure.

The most famous actual conjecture is one made by a German mathematician who worked in Russia, Christian Goldbach (1690— 1764).

To explain it, we begin by saying that a prime number is any number greater than 1 that can only be divided by itself and 1. There are an infinite number of primes. The first few are 2,3,5,7,11, 13, 17; 19; and 23.

It seemed to Goldbach that any even number greater than 2 could be expressed as the sum of two

primes (sometimes in more than one way). Thus, 4 = 2 +2;6 =3+ 3;8=5+3; 10=5+512=7+5; 14 =7+7;16 =11 + 5;18 =13+ 5;20= 13 + 7; 22 =11+ 11;24 = 13 + 11;

13;34 = 17 + 17; 36 = 23 +13;38 =19+ 19;40 = 23 + 17;42 = 23 + 19; and so on.

No mathematician has ever found an even number higher than 2 that could not be expressed as the sum of two prime numbers. Every mathematician is convinced that no such number exists and that Goldbach's conjecture is true. However, no mathematician has ever been able to prove the conjecture.

But that sort of thing is the excitement of mathematics and of science generally. We shall never run out of problems, and some will always remain incredibly tantalizing.

1744,Franklin Stove,"['Hot', 'Benjamin Franklin']",['Franklin'],"Originally, campfires were built in the open, or inside a cave. Fires in confined areas presented a problem with smoke, so chimneys had to be invented. Fireplaces and chimneys are wasteful, however. Hot air from the fire goes straight up the chimney and does not warm much of the room. Indeed, the rising hot air creates a draft that brings cold air in from the outside.

It occurred to Benjamin Franklin (see 1733) that what was needed was an iron stove within a room. Inside that a fire could be built that would create no draft but would heat up the metal. That in turn would heat the air, and the warm air would stay inside the room instead of vanishing up a chimney. As for the smoke, that could pass through a stovepipe into the chimney.

Stoves of this sort grew instantly popular, and indeed, the modern home furnace in the basement is a kind of Franklin stove.

1745,Transcendental Numbers,"['Leonhard Euler', 'Euler']",['Latin'],"One would think that mathematicians had dealt with all the different kinds of numbers there were—integers, fractions, negative numbers, irrational numbers, imaginary numbers, what else could there be? In 1744 Leonhard

Euler (see 1736) pointed out that polynomial algebraic equations, consisting of powers of x, can have all sorts of solutions—whole numbers, fractions, irrationals, negatives, imaginaries, complex numbers, and so on. These are all algebraic numbers. Nevertheless, Euler pointed out, there are other numbers that can never be

a solution for any algebraic equation that can possibly be written. Such numbers are transcendental numbers, from Latin words meaning “to climb beyond,” because they climb beyond the equations, so to speak. We now know that there are an infinite number of transcendental numbers.

In 1745 he placed water in a metal container suspended by insulating

silk cords, and led a brass wire through a cork into the water. He built up an electric charge in the water but did not realize how much had accumulated in the device until an assistant happened to pick it up and touch the brass wire outside the cork. The container promptly discharged all of the electric charge it had accumulated and gave

the poor assistant a fearful shock. It was the first goodsized artifical electric shock anyone had ever received. (The lightning stroke is worse, of course, but it is a natural electric shock.)

A German physicist, Ewald Georg von Kleist (1700—-1748), independently produced the same device at about the same time. He discovered the strength of  the charge by accidentally discharging it into his own body. He said he wouldn’t take another such shock to be the king of France and worked with the device no longer.

Because Musschenbroek popularized the device and because he worked at the University of Leyden in the Netherlands, the electricity-storing device came to be called a Leyden jar. It was at once made use of by other experimenters.

1747,Blood and Iron,['Vincenzo Menghini'],['Italian'],"Chemists had little or no idea of the composition of living tissue—even what el-

ements it contained, since so little was known about the elements.

Of course, iron was known, and an Italian physician, Vincenzo Menghini (1704-1759), fed iron preparations to dogs in 1745 in order to see what would happen to the iron and whether any of it would be incorporated in the tissues. To make sure that no iron was present in dogs that didn’t eat the iron preparation, he obtained blood from normal dogs and burned it, expecting to find no iron in the ash. However, he did find iron, to his surprise. What's more, he was able to ascertain that

the iron was present, specifically, in the red blood corpuscles.

This represented the first discovery in living tissue of a trace element; that is, one present in only small quantities but nevertheless essential to life (though the fact that iron was essential to life was not yet understood).

1748,Scurvy,"['Vasco', 'James Lind', 'Lind']","['Great Britain', 'British']","Ever since Vasco da Gama's voyage (see 1497), scurvy had been an increas-

ing menace. More men were disabled by scurvy on long voyages than by any other cause. This was particularly serious in Great

Britain, which depended on its navy for protection and on its merchant ships for its prosperity.

A British physician,

James Lind (1716—1794), had served in the navy and knew that the diet on board ship was monotonous in the extreme, consisting of hardtack, salt pork, and other food items whose only virtue was that they didn'’t spoil in an age without refrigeration or canning. He also knew that

scurvy appeared in prisons, in besieged towns, on overland exploring expeditions —always where diet was limited and monotonous. Lind therefore studied the effect of adding food items that didn’t last well, especially fruits and vegetables, to the diet of people affected with scurvy. In 1747

he found that citrus fruits worked amazingly well in effecting relief. It was nearly half a century, however, before the British navy could bestir itself to make use of that fact and put an end to the menace of scurvy.

1748,Osmosis,['Nollet'],"['French', 'Greek']","It is a common observation that liquids will soak through some materials but not others. But if a liquid soaks through a particular material, it seems reasonable to suppose that it will soak through in either direction.

Nevertheless, when a French experimenter, JeanAntoine Nollet (1700— 1770), covered an alcoholic solution with a section of pig’s bladder and placed it in a tub of water, the blad-

N

der began to bulge over a period of time as though more water was entering the solution than was leaving it. Eventually, the bladder membrane burst,

In this way, Nollet discovered what is now called a semipermeable membrane —that is, one permeable to some fluids but not to others. If there are different fluids on the two sides of such a membrane (pure water on one side, for instance, and an alcoholic solution on the other), the fluid flow in one direction

may be greater than in the other. This is called osniosis (from a Greek word meaning “push,” since the fluid ends by pushing through in one direction).

The explanation for osmosis had to wait half a century till the notion of molecules of different sizes was understood.

1749,Platinum,"['Egypt', 'Platinum', 'Antonio']","['Gold', 'Spanish', 'Ulloa', 'South America']","Gold, silver, and copper are not the only rare metals

sometimes found in free metallic form. Another is plati num. A metallic casket found among the relics of seventh century B.c. Egypt is reported to be of platinum. In general, however, the existence of this metal remained unremarked and unknown. For one thing, platinum is as rare as gold, but it lacks gold’s ostentatious beauty. Platinum has a dull, leaden color when

unpolished that does not attract the eye.

In 1748, however, a Spanish scientist, Antonio de Ulloa (1716-1795), published a report on his travels in South America. In it, he reported on platina (from a Spanish word for “silver,” chiefly because it was a free metal that lacked the pronounced

color of gold or copper). He remarked on its peculiar properties, for when properly examined, it turned out to be denser than gold, higher-melting, and even less reactive. Eventually, it proved extremely useful to scientists for just these properties.

1749,Biological Evolution,"['Buffon', 'Buffon Buffon']","['French', 'Buffon']","Until now, natural historians who had been busily engaged in classifying life forms had refrained, out of religious conviction or out of prudence, from drawing the logical conclusion that biological evolution had taken place.

The first important scientist to speculate openly on evolution was the French naturalist GeorgesLouis Leclerc de Buffon (1707-1788).In 1749, he

began publishing volumes of his book Natural History, which was eventually to consist of forty-four volumes.

Buffon treated evolution as a matter of degeneration. It is, after all, a common observation that many things deteriorate with time. Why should not evolution exemplify this? Buffon maintained that apes were degenerated humans, donkeys degenerated horses, jackals degenerated wolves, and so on.

This view is quite wrong, but it implied that

species did change with time, which was crucially important. It also sufficed to get Buffon into a certain amount of trouble, which he managed to smooth over with diplomatic recantations.

1751,Formation of the Earth,"['God', 'Earth', 'Buffon', 'Earth Buffon']","['Buffon', 'Earth', 'Earth Earth', 'Ussher']","Buffon (see above) was also daring enough to think that there might be some natural cause, one not involving God, for Earth’s coming into existence. In the first  volume of his Natural History, he suggested that Earth (and presumably the other planets) had been formed by the collision of the Sun with another massive body (which he called a comet).

Buffon then tried to decide how old the Earth was by calculating how many years it would take an ob-

ject the size of the Earth to cool from the temperature of the Sun to the temperature of the Earth today. This, he eventually announced, could be as much as 75,000 years; Earth had grown cool enough to support life about 40,000 years before, and it would exist for another 90,000 years before becoming too cold

to support lite any longer.

To be sure, Buffon'’s estimates of these values were much smaller than the time periods scientists were to accept later on, but he was the first important scientist to suggest that the Earth might be much older than the 6,000 years allotted it by Ussher (see 1650).

1751,Nickel,"['Brandt', 'Axel Fredrick Cronstedt', 'Brandt Cronstedt', 'Cronstedt']",['Swedish'],"Although Brandt had isolated cobalt fourteen years before (see 1737), the problem of copper ore that did not yield copper persisted. Some of this sort of ore didn’t yield cobalt, either, and the miners called it kupfernickel (Old Nick's copper, with reference to the devil).

In 1751 a Swedish mineralogist, Axel Fredrick Cronstedt (1722—1765), who had studied under Brandt, tackled kupfernickel and isolated from it a white metal that was neither copper nor cobalt. Cronstedt called it nickel,

taking the second half of the miners’ name.

Cronstedt discovered that nickel, like iron but less strongly, was attracted by a magnet. It was the first time that anything but iron had been found to be attracted by a magnet. As a matter of fact, magnets were eventually found to attract cobalt as well.

Indeed, iron, cobalt, and nickel are very similar metals. This was the first hint that elements might be grouped into families and that some sort of order might be imposed on them—but that did not take place for another century.

1752,Encyclopedias,"['Denis Diderot', 'Diderot']","['Reason', 'Greek', 'French']","The growing accumulation of knowledge and the growing self-confidence of the scientists of this period (which called itself the Age of Reason) made it natural to think of preparing a multivelume summary of all knowledge for the general public, under headings arranged in alphabetical order. This would be an encyclopedia, from Greek words meaning “general education.”

A rather modest suggestion to this effect was made by a bookseller to a prolific French free-lance writer, Denis Diderot (1713—1784)  Diderot caught fire and made a huge project out of it. He used collaborators but in the end did most of the work alone. The first volume appeared in 1751.

Diderot's product was the first modern encyclopedia. It took a completely rational view of the world and clearly opposed the shibboleths of state and

church at that time. It impressed intellectuals as the supreme product of the Age of Reason.

1752,Lightning Rod,"['Benjamin Franklin', 'Franklin', 'Fay', 'Excess', 'Excess Franklin', 'Franklin Franklin', 'Franklin Earth', 'Franklin Franklin Franklin', 'Richard', 'Almanac']","['Leyden', 'Leyden Leyden', 'Franklin', 'Frank-', 'Leyden Leyden Leyden', 'Leyden Poor', 'America']","The Leyden jar (see 1745) had become a favorite plaything of many scientists. One of them was Benjamin Franklin.

In 1747 Franklin rejected du Fay's notion of two electrical fluids (see 1733). He thought there was only one, which could exist in an excess (above normal) or in a deficiency (below normal). Excess repelled excess, since neither could accept the other’s. Similarly, deficiency repelled deficiency, since neither could offer anything to the other. Excess, however, attracted deficiency, and the electrical fluid poured from the excess to the deficiency, neutralizing both

and leaving each uncharged.

Franklin suggested that the excess be called positive electricity and the deficiency negative electricity. There was no telling which variety of electricity, vitreous or resinous, was positive and which negative. Franklin guessed arbitrarily and happened to guess wrong. That makes no difference, however. The names can be used and the literal meanings forgotten.

Franklin noted the manner of discharge of the Leyden jar. When the electrical charge was drawn off, it emitted a spark of light and a erackle of sound. Franklin was struck by the similarity to a tiny lightning stroke and an

equally tiny crack of thunder. He at once reversed the thought. During a thunderstorm, did Earth and sky set up a gigantic Leyden jar, and was the lightning and thunder an equally gigantic discharge?

He decided to experiment. In 1751, he flew a kite in a thunderstorm. The kite carried a metal point to which a long silk thread was attached. At the bottom of the thread, near Franklin (who held onto the silk by way of a second i thread that remained dry), 4 was a metal key. As the thunderclouds gathered and the silk thread began to show signs of electrical charge (the separate fibers : repelled each other), Frank- lin put his knuckle near the  key and it sparked and crackled just like a Leyden jar. Moreover, Franklin charged a Leyden jar from the key just as easily as if it were a friction machine. The Leyden jar charged by heavenly electricity behaved precisely as though it had been charged by earthly electricity. The two electricities were identical. Franklin was able to put his discovery to practical use at once. Lightning, he decided, hit a particular building when that building gathered charge during a thunderstorm. His experience with Leyden jars showed that they discharged much more easily if a sharp needle was attached to them. Indeed, the charge leaked out so easily through the needle that they couldn't be charged in the first place. Why not, then, attach a sharp metal rod to the top of a building, and ground it properly, so that any charge that gathered might leak away rapidly and silently and no charge would accumulate to the point where a disastrous discharge would be forced. Franklin published his thoughts on the matter in 1752 in Poor Richard's Almanac, and the lightning rods, as they were called, began to go up at once, first in America and then in Eu-

rope. They proved efficacious, and for the first time in history, a natural catastrophe was averted not by prayer or by magical incantations of one sort or another, which never really worked, but by reliance on an understanding of natural laws, which did work. Once lightning rods appeared on church steeples (which, being the highest point in town, were particularly vulnerable), the point was made for all to see.

In 1752, a French physicist, René-Antoine Ferchault de Réaumur (1683— 1757), induced a hawk to swallow metal cylinders that were open at both ends, with those ends covered by wire gauze. Inside the cylinder was meat.

Ordinarily, a hawk swallows its food in large pieces, digests what it can, and regurgitates the indigestible remainder. Réaumur waited for the hawk to regurgitate the cylinder and found the meat partially dissolved. Clearly, the meat could not have been

1752,Lol,"['Réaumur', 'Muscles']",[],"affected by grinding or by any mechanical action, since the metal cylinders protected it from that. Therefore, the stomach juices must have had a chemical effect on the meat.

He checked this further by persuading the hawk to swallow a small sponge. When that was regurgitated, it was soaked with stomach juice, which Réaumur squeezed out and collected. He found that this stomach juice slowly dissolved meat placed in it. He experimented with dogs, too, and obtained the same results. Muscles and bones might behave like mechanical systems, but the body was a chemical device as well, and as scientists increasingly discovered, the chemistry is even more important than the mechanics.

In 1754, however, a Scottish chemist, Joseph Black (1728-1799), in his thesis for a medical degree (which he published two years later), described how he had formed a gas by strongly heating limestone (calcium carbonate), leaving lime (calcium oxide) behind. The gas he produced would combine with calcium oxide to form calcium carbonate once again. He

called the gas fixed air, because it could be fixed (made to take on a solid form) by combination with calcium oxide. Fixed air turned out to be carbon dioxide.

It was clear, then, that gases could be formed from ordinary solids and that they could take part in chemical reactions. That went far toward converting gases from mysteries to chemicals.

In fact, since calcium oxide slowly turned to calcium carbonate if simply allowed to remain exposed to air, it was clear that there must be some small fraction of the air that was car-

bon dioxide. That was the first indication that air was not a simple substance (an element) but a mixture of different gases.

In studying the action of heat on calcium carbonate, by the way, Black measured the loss of weight involved in its conversion to calcium oxide. He also measured the amount of acid that a given quantity of calcium carbonate would neutralize. This was the first application of quantitative analysis to chemical reactions, a chemical wave of the future that could come to fruition in a quarter of a century.  1755

glish astro! er, Thomas Wright (1711-1786), maintained that the stars formed a flattened finite system, but his writings

re so mystical that it was hard to take him seriously.

In 1755, however, the German philosopher Immanuel Kant (1724—1804) made a similar suggestion. He said the Sun was one of a large number of stars that existed in a lens-shaped conglomerate, and that the

<y Way was the result of

This conglomerate came to be called the Galaxy, from a Greek word for the Milky Way. Kant also suggested that certain nebulas

he called them in a dr. matic phrase, “island universes.""'

In this, Kant was quite correct, but it was to be over half a century before

1758,Land Bridges,"['God', 'God Nicolas Desmarest', 'Desmarest']","['Genesis', 'French', 'England', 'France']","In the book of Genesis, God is described as separating land and sea on the third day of creation. It does not say that God fixed the boundaries eternally, but this was assumed. It was taken for granted by Europeans that the shape of the continents was fixed and

eternal, barring certain trivial changes produced by storms.

In 1756, however, a French geologist, Nicolas Desmarest (1725-1815), pointed out the similarities of the channel shores of England and France and suggested that there had been a land bridge between them once, a bridge now

covered by the sea. (In time, he was proved correct.) This was the first indication that continents might shift and change shape. Desmarest thought such changes were brought about by earthquakes, which was not a bad idea, but it was wrong.

1758,Halley’'s Comet,"['Halley', 'Johann Georg Palitzsch', 'Halley Hall', 'William', 'Giotto']","['England', 'Normandy', 'Halley']","A little over half a century before, Halley had predicted that the comet of

1682 would return in 1758 (see 1705). The amateur astronomer Johann Georg Palitzsch (1723—1788) set up his telescope and

trained it on the part of the sky where the comet was expected to appear, if it did return. On December 25, 1758, he spotted it, and  once the news broke, professional astronomers zeroed their instruments in upon it. The comet has ever since been known as Halley's comet, or in line with the conventions of the present day, Comet Halley. Calculating backward, Hall

comet turned out to be the one that appeared at the time of the invasion of England by William of Normandy. It was also the comet that Giotto painted (see 1304).

The return of Halley's comet suddenly made comets the headliners of astronomy, and for several decades it seemed that the greatest feat any astronomer could achieve was to discover comets.

1760,Embryology,"['Kaspar Friedrich Wolff', 'Wolff']",['German'],"It was customary at this time to think that seeds and eggs (or pollen and sperm) had miniature organisms in them that simply grew. Some even thought that an organism within an egg might have eggs of its own with ultraminiature organisms within and still smaller eggs—and so on.

In 1759, however, the German physiologist Kaspar Friedrich Wolff (1734—-1794) showed that specialized organs developed out of unspecialized tissue. Thus the tip of a growing shoot consists of undifferentiated and generalized tissue. As it grows, however, specialization develops, and some bits of tissue develop into flowers, while other bits, originally

undistinguishable, develop into leaves.

The same principle could, and did, apply to animals, so that the idea of miniature organisms in eggs disappeared. Wolff is considered another of the founders of modern embryology, in consequence.

1760,Earthquakes,['John Michell'],"['Greek', 'Lisbon', 'English']","Human beings have always known about earthquakes from sad and frightening experience. What they didn’t know was the cause.

Early theories attributed them to the restlessness of gods or demons imprisoned underground. The ancient Greek philosophers, in search of a more rational cause, supposed that there

might be pent-up air underground, which occasionally, in its attempt to escape, shook the earth. The Lisbon earthquake of 1755 forced serious thinking on the matter. In 1760,  the English physicist John Michell (1724—-1793) noted that earthquakes frequently appeared in volcanic areas. He felt that underground water might be boiled by volcanic heat at times, and that it was the imprisoned steam that caused earthquakes.

Furthermore, he said, the earthquakes set up waves that traveled through the Earth at some measurable speed. If the time at which waves reached different points were recorded, the point of origin (or epicenter) of the earthquake could be determined. Epicenters, he suggested, could exist in the rocks beneath the sea, and it was one of these that had destroyed Lisbon.

All of Michell’s ideas were pretty sound, so that he is known as the founder of seismology.

"
1760,Heat Capacity,['Heat'],['Black'],"Until this time it was assumed that as more heat poured into a substance, its

temperature rose steadily, and that given quantities of different materials all rose in temperature at the same rate. Why not? Heat was considered a very subtle fluid, and it made sense to suppose that it filled all substances equally, so that all given weights of substances had the same capacity for containing heat.

In 1760, however, Black (see 1754) showed that this notion, however sensible it seemed, was quite wrong. When he heated equal weights of mercury and water over the same flame, the mercury’s temperature went up twice as fast as the water’s temperature did. To Black, this indicated that the heat capacity of mercury was less than the heat capacity of water, so that mercury was more rapidly filled with heat.

It followed that if equal quantities of mercury and water were lTli,\'Cd. \‘\'thC mercury was at the higher temperature, the final temperature would not be pre-

cisely midway between but would be below the midpoint, because the quantity of heat present in the mercury and transferred to the water would not fill the water as much as it had the mercury.

This started the scientific study of heat, as distinct from temperature.

1761,Pathology,['Giovanni Battista Morgagni'],['Italian'],"In 1760 the Italian anatomist Giovanni Battista Morgagni (1682-1771) published a book in which he described the 640 postmortems he had conducted in his long life. He carefully detailed the lives of his patients, the presence and development of disease, and the manner of dying and tried to interpret everything from the anatomical point of view. As a result, he is usually considered the founder of modern pathology.

1761,Venus’s Atmosphere,"['Venus', 'Earth', 'Earth Venus', 'Venus Cassini', 'Mars', 'Venus Mikhail Vasilievich Lomenosov', 'Venus Venus']","['Venus', 'Venus Newfoundland', 'St.', 'Russian']","Unlike the other planets, Venus had no markings. It always presented a featureless white orb. It remained interesting, however, because periodically (being closer to the Sun than Earth is) it passed exactly between Earth and Sun. On such occasions, it appeared as a small black sphere moving across the face of the Sun. This is called a transit of Venus.

In 1761 there was a transit of Venus coming and astronomers organized expeditions to Newfoundland and to St. Helena to observe it from widely separated spots. If the exact time at which Venus’s orb first touched the Sun’s rim and the exact time at which it finally left on the other side were determined from those widely separated

spots, Venus's parallax could be determined, and its distance, together with that of the Sun, might be determined to a higher degree of accuracy than was produced by Cassini’s determination of the parallax of Mars.

The expedition failed. The time when Venus entered and left the solar sphere could not be determined accurately, to the frustration of all.

One observer, the Russian scientist Mikhail Vasilievich Lomenosov (1711— 1765), pointed out that this could be due to Venus’s possession of an atmosphere. The atmosphere would fuzz Venus's outline, so to speak, and make the points of contact difficult to time. Furthermore, if the atmosphere had a permanent cloud layer, that would help explain both Venus's brilliance (since the cloud layer would reflect most of

the sunlight striking it) and its featurelessness.

In 1761, however, an Austrian physician, Leopold Auenbrugger von Auenbrugg (1722-1809), published a book entitled Inventum novum (A New [nvention) in which he pointed out that tapping the body, especially the chest area, and listening to the sound produced would give some indication of certain disorders of the internal organs. (He checked this by comparing the sounds he elicited with the state of the organs as revealed by postmortems.)

It took forty years, however, before this diagnostic method became common in medicine.

1763,Latent Heat,['Black'],['Black'],"Black (see 1754) found in 1762 that if a mixture of ice and water was heated, the heat was absorbed but the temperature did not change. All the heat went toward melting the ice into water, the water being at the same temperature as

ice but containing more heat. The same happened to an even greater extent when water was boiled into vapor.

Black called this latent heat (from a Latin word for “hidden’), since the heat was there but did not make itself apparent in the form of temperature. The latent

heat was not lost, of course, for when water vapor was condensed to water, or water was frozen to ice, the latent heat was given off again.

An understanding of latent heat was important in the improvement of the steam engine a few years later.

1763,Pollination,"['Josef Gottlieb Kohlreuter', 'Pollen']",['German'],"The existence of sexuality in plants must have seemed strange, since plants, being essentially immobile, cannot indulge in the kind of sex that animals do.

In 1763, however, a German botanist, Josef Gottlieb Kohlreuter (1733

1806), pointed out the manner in which plant pollen can be blown by the wind to reach female organs in a purely random manner. Because of this randomness, plants that depend on wind pollination must produce pollen in vast amounts.

He also pointed out that a more efficient pro-

cess is to have bees or other similar animals do the job. A bee enters a flower in search of nectar (the bribe to make it enter). Pollen coats the bee's fuzzy covering, and when the bee visits the next flower, that pollen rubs off on the pistil.  1764

1763,Steam Engine,"['James Watt', 'Watt']","['Newcomen', 'Scottish']","For half a century, the Newcomen steam engine had been used by miners despite its inefficiency. In 1764, a steam engine of this sort was given to a Scottish engineer, James Watt (1736-1819), to repair.

The repair was easy, but Watt wanted to im-

prove it. He had learned of latent heat from his friend Black (see 1762), and he realized how wasteful it was to keep heating, cooling, and reheating the same chamber. The thought came to him, then, of having two chambers. One would always be kept hot and the other would always be kept cold. While the

steam was doing its work, it would be in the hot chamber, and when it had to be condensed, a system of valves would bleed it into the cold chamber for condensation while more steam was formed in the hot chamber. That was the beginning of the first reasonably efficient steam engine.  1765

1766,Plutonism,"['Nicolas Desmarest', 'Abraham Gottlob Werner']","['French', 'Guettard', 'France', 'Greek', 'German', 'Neptunist']","The French geologist Nicolas Desmarest (see 1756) was interested in the changes taking place on the face of the Earth. He was the first to maintain that valleys had been formed by the streams that ran through them.

In 1765 he carried for-

ward the ideas of Guettard (see 1752). Not only did he maintain that heat was the source of change, but he saw it as having been applied through volcanic action. He maintained that basalt was a rock of volcanic origin and that large sections of France’s rocks consisted of ancient lava flows. He was a Plutonist, in

other words (from the Greek god Pluto who was lord of the underworld). However, most geologists remained under the spell of a German geologist, Abraham Gottlob Werner (1750-1817), who was a Neptunist (see 1752) and insisted that water was the source of all change in the Earth's surface.

1768,Hydrogen,"['Black', 'Henry Cavendish', 'Cavendish', 'Albrecht', 'Haller']","['British', 'Boyle', 'Greek', 'Swiss']","Black’s work with carbon dioxide (see 1754) had led to great interest in gases on the part of chemists. In 1766 the British chemist Henry Cavendish (17311810) found that some metals, when acted on by acid, liberated a gas that was highly inflammable and

which he therefore called fire air. (We now call the gas hydrogen.)

Actually, early experimenters, notably Boyle (see 1661), had obtained the gas, but Cavendish was the first to study it carefully and report on its properties, so he is usually given the credit for having discovered it.

Cavendish measured the weight of particular volumes of different gases in order to determine their densities. He found this new gas to be only one-fourteenth the density of air, and no substance under ordinary conditions has ever been found to be less dense.  Nerves

From Greek times, nerves had been thought to be hollow tubes that carried some sort of subtle fluid, perhaps in analogy to veins and arteries.

A Swiss physiologist, Albrecht von Haller (1708— 1777), dismissed this possibility and decided to reach no decisions on nerves that could not be demonstrated by experiment. His experimental work, which he published in 1766, showed that

muscles were irritable; that is, a slight stimulus to the muscle would produce a sharp contraction. He also showed that a stimulus to a nerve would produce a sharp contraction in the muscle to which it was attached. The nerve was the more irritable and required the smaller stimulus.

Haller judged, therefore, that it was nervous stimulation that controlled muscular movement. He also showed that the tissues

themselves do not experience a sensation but that the nerves channel and carry the impulses that produce the sensation. Furthermore, Haller showed that nerves all led to the brain or to the spinal cord, which were thus clearly indicated as the centers of sense perception and responsive action. For all this, he is considered the founder of modern neurol-

ogy.

That might disprove the spontaneous generation of organisms large enough to see, but since then, scientists had learned of myriads of microorganisms.

Could these arise through spontaneous generation? The British naturalist John Turberville Needham (1713—-1781) had placed mutton broth in a glass container, killed all microorganisms by heating, and then sealed the container. He reported that a few days later, the broth contained numerous microorganisms that must have developed spontaneously. This experiment, conducted in 1740,

seemed impressive, but there was some suspicion that he had not heated the broth sufficiently and had not managed to kill all the microorganisms.

In 1768 the Italian biologist Lazzaro Spallanzani (1729-1799) decided to repeat the experiment and make sure. He boiled his solution for one-half to threequarters of an hour, then sealed the flask. No new microorganisms appeared  thereafter, though they did appear if he boiled the solution for shorter periods. The conclusion was that there was no spontaieous generation even for microorganisms.

Since there was one in 1761, there would be another in 1769. In 1768, therefore, the English navigator James Cook (1728-1779), usually called Captain Cook, was sent out on a voyage to the Pacific Ocean. He was to observe the transit from the newly discovered island of Tahiti.

In the course of this voyage, he was the first to explore, thoroughly, the

shores of Australia and to get an idea of its size Though earlier explorers had spied its shores, it was Cook whose reports were sufficiently detailed to bring the land clearly to European attention. For that reason, he is usually considered the discoverer of Australia. This, and two more voyages in the years following, made Cook the most famous navigator since Magellan (see 1523). Cook crisscrossed the Pacific Ocean and finally demonstrated that it had no significant land areas in it. With Australia, the last major habitable land area on Earth had been discovered.

In the course of his voyages, Cook made use of Lind’s dietary discovery (see 1747) and lost only one man to scurvy.

1769,Carbonated Water,"['Joseph Priestley', 'Priestley']",['English'],"An English chemist, Joseph Priestley (1733-1804), grew interested in gases in 1768, partly because he lived next door to a brewery and was able to make use of quantities of the carbon dioxide generated in the brewing process

He found that when he dissolved some of the carbon dioxide in water (carbonated water), he created what he considered a pleasantly tart and refreshing drink, the one we call seltzer, or soda water, today. Since it required only flavoring and sugar to produce soda pop, Priestley may be viewed as the father of today’s gigantic soft-drink industry.

1769,Quantitative Chemistry,"['Black', 'Lavoisier', 'Sediment']","['French', 'Greek']","Although Black had demonstrated the usefulness of quantitative measurements in chemistry (see 1754), what made them an integral part of the science was the work of French chemist Antoine-Laurent Lavoisier (1743—1794), who isuniversally considered the father of modern chemistry.

There were at this time some who still clung to the Greek theory of elements and their changeability. They argued that if water were boiled for a long time, a sediment appeared, and that this was clearly a conversion of water into a kind of earth, in line with Greek thinking.

Lavoisier decided, in 1769, to test this matter. He boiled water for 101 days in a device that condensed the

water vapor and returned it to the flask, so that no water was lost in the process. He weighed both water and vessel before and after the boiling.

Sediment did appear, but the water did not change its weight during the boiling, so the sediment wasn’t formed out of the water. The flask itself, however, had lost an amount of weight just equal to the weight of the sediment. In other words, the sediment was material from the glass, slowly etched away by the hot water and precipitating in solid fragments. Here was a clear-cut example of the way in which observation, without measurement, could be useless and misleading.

Great Britain, and any mechanical device that could increase production would add to the wealth of those who owned the mills and factories.

In 1769 an English inventor, Richard Arkwright (1732-1792), invented a spinning frame: a mechanical device that could produce cotton threads hard enough and firm enough to be used in textile manufacture. The frame helped produce textiles not only faster than handworkers could but so simply that Arkwright could work with relatively unskilled operators who would do the work for little money. Arkwright died a millionaire, but at a cost. Many were thrown out of work by his invention and went hungry, because the government at this time did not consider itself responsible for the welfare of its citizens.

1770,Nile River,"['James Bruce', 'Bruce']","['Africa', 'Portuguese', 'Scottish', 'Khartoum', 'Sudan', 'Lake Tana']","The coasts of the continents were relatively easy to explore, but the interior represented greater toil and greater risks. This was particularly true of Africa. Its shores had been the first to be explored by the Portuguese explorers, but its interior was the last to be brought into the light of known geography, so that for a long time it was known as the Dark Continent.

Most paradoxical was the matter of the Nile River. On the banks of its northernmost portion, one of the two oldest civilizations of the world flourished, yet neither the Egyptians nor any of the civilized people that followed them had ever discovered the source of the Nile. This becomes less surprising when it is understood that the Nile is the longest river in the world. It flows in a fairly straight line from south to north, and the source is over 4,000 miles from the mouth. The ancient Egyptians had made their way upriver for about 1,500 miles before giving up the search.

In 1770, however, the Scottish explorer James Bruce (1730-1794) made his way upstream to Khartoum in the Sudan. There two rivers join, the White Nile coming up from the southwest and the Blue Nile from the southeast. Bruce followed the Blue Nile and finally found its source in Lake Tana in what is now northwestern Ethiopia.

This seemed at the time to solve the problem of the source of the Nile, but the White Nile, being the longer of the two, is the main river, and its source remained unknown for another century.

Franklin (see 1733) had traveled from America to Europe several times and his ever-inquiring niind became aware of the difference in speed in the two directions. He was the first to study ships’ reports seriously and to query the experience of whalers. As a

result he found that there was a current of warm water coming up from the Gulf of Mexico (the Gulf Stream) and then crossing the North Atlantic toward Europe. It sped the ships sailing eastward to Europe and slowed those sailing westward to North America. Franklin mapped it and in this way showed British navigators the routes to avoid if they wished to make good time westward. This was the beginning of the scientific study of ocean currents.

Water currents did not concern only navigators. Labrador and Great Britain are at precisely the same latitude on opposite sides of the North Atlantic Ocean. However, the Gulf Stream, a warm-water current, bathes the British coasts, while a cold-water current from the Arctic bathes the Labrador coast. For that reason, Great Britain has a mild climate and is populated by tens of millions, while Labrador is frigid and is populated by tens of thousands.

One such was the French astronomer Charles Messier (1730-1817), who discovered twenty-one comets, but who was depressed whenever some other astronomer discovered one he had missed, or when he was kept away from his telescope as, for instance, when his wife was on her deathbed.

He was irritated by the false hopes aroused by the sighting of some fuzzy object that turned out not to be a comet but a nebulosity fixed to some spot in the

heavens. In 1771 he published a list of 45 of these nebulas, which in later years he expanded

to 103.

As it turned out, the list of Messier objects turned out to be far grander and more important than comets, and Messier would be completely forgotten now if his comet discoveries were his only accomplishment. It is his list of things to be disregarded that has made his name immortal, for it includes numerous star clusters and distant galaxies.

1772,Plants and Carbon Dioxide,['Earth'],['Carbon'],"Carbon dioxide was well known by this time to sup- l port neither combustion nor animal life. Priestley (see 1768) thought of checking to see whether plants, as well as animals, were unable to live in carbon dioxide. In 1771 he placed a lit candle in an enclosed volume of air until the candle would burn no more and the air was filled with carbon dioxide. He then placed a sprig of mint in a glass of water and placed it in the enclosed air. The plant did not die. It lived there for months  and seemed to flourish. What was more, at the end of that time, a mouse could be put into that volume of air and live—and a candle would burn.

Whatever it was about air that supported combustion and animal life, and 1ha[ was CUH\'CI'[CL]. into carbon dioxide by burning candles and breathing animals,

1772,Combustion,"['George Ernst Stahl', 'Stahl', 'Stahl Lavoisier', 'Lavoisier']","['German', 'Greek']","Chemists’ understanding of combustion at this time was based on a theory first propounded in 1700 by a German chemist, George Ernst Stahl (1660—1734). He suggested that objects that were combustible were rich in something he called phlogiston, from a Greek word meaning “to set on fire.”

In the process of combustion, fuel lost its phlogiston, and eventually a residue was left that lacked phlogiston and would not burn. Stahl recognized that rusting was comparable to combustion. He believed metals to be rich in phlogiston and held that they grad-

ually lost it as they were converted to rust.

The chief flaw in the theory was that when wood burned it lost much of its weight (presumably because of the loss of phlogiston), yet when iron rusted, it gained weight. In Stahl’s time, however, it wasn’t considered important to measure quantities exactly and chemists ignored this paradox.

Lavoisier (see 1769), however, believed in weighing. In 1772 he began heating objects in enclosed volumes and weighing that volume. For instance, he burned certain elements in air and found that the material produced was heavier than the elements them-

selves, though nothing within the container had changed weight at all. If the elements gained weight in burning, then something else must have lost weight, and the only something else this could be was the enclosed air. If some of the air had been absorbed by the burning elements, there should be a partial vacuum in the flask. Lavoisier opened the flask, and sure enough, air rushed in. The added weight of the inrushing air was equal to

the weight gained by the element that had been burned.

By such experiments, Lavoisier concluded that combustion did not come about through the loss of

phlogiston, but through the combination of the substance that was burning or rusting with some portion of the air. This killed the phlogiston theory, although a few important chemists continued to accept phlogiston for some decades longer.

"
1772,Diamond,['Lavoisier'],[],"One of the substances that Lavoisier burned (see above) was a diamond. He and some other chemists invested in one, placed it in a closed vessel, and then focused sunlight on it with a magnifying glass. The diamond, when it grew hot enough, simply disap-

peared, and carbon dioxide appeared within the vessel. The conclusion was that diamond consisted of carbon and, despite appearances, was chemically very closely related to coal.

"
1773,Nitrogen,['Daniel Rutherford'],"['British', 'Greek']","At this time it was known that ordinary air supported combustion and animal life and that carbon dioxide did not. If candles were burned in an enclosed volume of air until no further burning was possible, had all the air become carbon dioxide? Black (see 1754) asked a student of his, the British chemist Daniel Rutherford (1749-1819), to investigate

the matter. In 1772 Rutherford, having burned a candle to extinction in a closed container, absorbed all the carbon dioxide that had been produced by combining it with certain chemicals. He found that there was still a great deal of gas left that was not carbon dioxide, which also supported neither combustion nor animal life. He had, in this way, discovered a new gas that eventually came to be called nitrogen. This is from the Greek, meaning “niter producer,” since niter, a mineral properly called potassium nitrate, contains nitrogen.

land earlier. However, the Arctic Circle passes through northern North America, Europe, and Asia, and once the glaciers had retreated, the line was open to venturesome hunters.

The Antarctic Circle, however, lies far to the south of any populated area. The closest is Tierra del Fuego at the southern tip of South America, which even at its most  southerly is still about 650 miles north. It is safe to say, then, that no human being, primitive or civilized, had ever crossed the Antarctic Circle prior to 1773

In that year, Captain Cook, on his second voyage through the Pacific in search of an important land area, ventured far to the south and on January 17 (at the height of the Antarctic summer) crossed the Antarctic Circle, a true first for humanity.

In 1773, however, a Danish biologist, Otto Friedrich Muller (1730-1784), managed to make them out well enough to divide them into categories. Some looked like little rods and he called them bacilli (from a Latin word for

In addition, a gas was

given off that possessed most unusual properties. Combustibles burned more brilliantly and rapidly in it than they did in ordinary air. Mice placed in an atmosphere of this gas were particularly frisky, and Priestley himself felt and easy'’ when he breathed it.

When Lavoisier heard of the experiments of Priestley and of Rutherford (see 1772), he realized in the light of his own experiments that air must consist of a mixture of two gases: one-fifth was Priestley’s gas, which Lavoisier named oxygen (from Greek words meaning “acid producer,” because it was mistakenly felt at the time that all acids contained oxygen), and four-fifths were Rutherford’s gas, which Lavoisier named azote (from Greek words meaning ‘‘no life”), but which later came to be known as nitrogen.

Clearly, it was oxygen that supported combustion and animal life and oxygen that was involved in rusting. Animals must consume oxygen and produce carbon dioxide, and from Priestley’s earlier experiment (see 1771), plants must consume carbon dioxide and produce oxygen. Between these two forms of life, the atmosphere’s makeup remained stable.

However, Scheele’s discovery was not

published (through the negligence of a publisher) until after Priestley’s discovery had been reported, so Priestley gets the credit.

Scheele, however, discovered many simple compounds from plants and animals, to say nothing of such poisonous gases as hydrogen fluoride, hydrogen sulfide, and hydrogen cyanide. He was also involved in the discovery of a number of elements, though he never managed to get undisputed credit for a single one of them.

Thus, by 1774 he had done most of the spadework that led to the discovery of the element manganese. His friend, the Swedish mineralogist Johan Gottlieb Gahn (1745-1818), however, took the final step and gets credit for the discovery.

Also in 1774, Scheele isolated the gas chlorine, which was unusual in not being colorless. Chlorine is greenish-yellow in color, and its name, in fact, is derived from the Greek word for “green.” The trouble was that Scheele did not recognize chlorine to be an element but thought it was a combination of some substance with oxygen. Chlorine was found to be an element about thirty years later, and it was to that finder that credit for the discovery was awarded.

1775,Mind and Disease,"['Franz Anton Mesmer', 'Lavoisier', 'Franklin', 'Mesmer', 'Mesmer Franklin']","['German', 'Paris', 'Franklin']","Throughout history, diseases had been cured (so it was said) by various mystic rites, by the laying on of hands, the saying of prayers, and so on.

In 1774 the German physician and mystic Franz Anton Mesmer (1734-1815) began to apply science to this by waving magnets over his patients, and effecting cures in some cases. Later, he discovered that magnets were unnecessary and that the same happy results could be achieved by simply passing hands over the patient. He claimed to be making use of animal magnetism.

Naturally, in some cases he did not effect a cure, and he was driven out of Vienna, where he first practiced, as a quack. He went to Paris, where again he was first popular and then forced to leave. His methods were examined by such men as Franklin and Lavoisier.

Franklin, for one, although he condemned Mesmer’s mysticism, recognized that the mind influenced the body: that it could cause disorders and that it could be used to correct them.

What Mesmer was dealing with (without under standing it as well as Franklin did) were psychosomatic ailments, where often it is only necessary for patients to believe they

The dark Mediterranean people were aware that the Germanic peoples were generally taller and blonder. Europeans noted the short height and oddly shaped eyelids of Asian invaders such as Huns and Mongols, and from ancient times they knew of the dark-hued Africans.

The first orderly classification of these varieties came in 1776, when a German anthropologist, Johann Friedrich

Blumenbach (1752—1840), divided the human species into five races: Caucasian (Europeans), Mongolian (East Asians), Malayan (Southeast Asians and Pacific Islanders), Ethiopians (sub-Saharan Africans), and Americans (Native Americans). A more unsophisticated way of dividing them is to call them, respectively: the White, Yellow, Brown, Black, and Red races.

The fact remains, though, that all human beings, however superficially different in appearance they may be, are members of a single species and can freely interbreed. There is

no indication that there is any important difference between any of these groups, either physical, mental, or psychological. Blumenbach's divisions were far too general and simplistic, for each group can be divided into subgroups, and the Native Australians are left out altogether. Blumenbach's focus on superficial differences of skin color, hair form, and eyelid shape merely served to make it easier to express racist views in scientificsounding language. The dark evils of slavery and of ethnic persecutions were thus made to sound lofty and biologically inevitable.

In 1777, however, the French physicist CharlesAugustin de Coulomb (1736—1806) showed that it took a certain amount of

If no children were born, it was assumed that the woman involved, like desert soil, was “barren.”

In 1779 Spallanzani (see 1768) studied the development of eggs. At that time, it was thought that the ovarian follicles (discovered by the Dutch anatomist Reinier de Graaf [1641-1673] in 1673 and still called Graafian follicles as a result) were the eggs.

Spallanzani showed that fertilization did not take place unless the sperm cells in the semen actually made physical contact with the follicles. This was a strong indication that reproduction was not a onesided affair, but that both mother and father contributed to the birth of a child and that either side might be at fault in case children were not born.

Because of the importance of light, and because plants in the process produced not only light but also the large molecules of their tissues, the process came to be called photosynthesis, from Greek words meaning “to put together by light.”  1780

The Industrial Revolution and the Early 19th Century (1781—1850)

The year 1781, when James Watt made a steam engine capable of turning a wheel, marked a new era. Steamgenerated power meant that machines no longer had to be tied to natural energy sources like wind and flowing water. And with rotary motion, engines could now be used to improve the speed and efficiency of many types of machines. Factories were built and the size of machines increased, as did the scale of production. More and more people left rural areas and agricultural pursuits to work in growing urban centers. Another key area of technological advance was transportation, which in turn supported industry by more quickly moving greater numbers of people, goods, and supplies than ever before. Great strides were made in the development of electricity. In 1800 Alessandro Volta created a primitive battery. The phe-

nomenon of electromagnetism was discovered in 1820 when scientists saw that wires carrying an electric current had magnetic properties. Probing for more knowledge about the phenomenon, Michael Faraday showed that electrical forces could produce motion and create lines of force. Electricity was put in the service of chemistry when Humphry Davy passed an electric current through compounds that could not be broken up by other means, isolating for the first time the elements sodium, potassium, barium, strontium, calcium, and magnesium; this was the beginning of electrochemistry. Chemistry continued to be an area of great achievement. In 1789 Antoine Lavoisier formulated the law of conservation of mass, and in 1799 Joseph-Louis Proust stated the law of definite proportions, allowing chemists to

distinguish between mixtures and compounds, When he proposed his atomic theory in 1803, John Dalton improved on the Greeks’ idea that all matter was composed of tiny, indivisible particles by introducing the concept of atomic weight. In 1811 Amedeo Avogadro came up with the hypothesis that all gases at the same volume, pressure, and temperature were made up of the same number of particles; in the process he coined the word molecules to describe the combinations of atoms that made up a gas. In physics some of the most important work focused on the nature of heat and its conversion into other forms of energy. In 1847 Hermann von Helmholtz enunciated the first law of thermodynamics—that the total amount of energy in the Universe is constant. In 1848 Baron Kelvin established the concept of absolute zero and in troduced a scale of temperature beginning at that point. The second law of thermodynamics, described in 1850 by Rudolf Clausius, stated that not all energy is equally useful and

that the amount of available energy in the Universe is constantly decreasing. Three innovations of this period improved communications worldwide, much as the invention of the al-

phabet and printing had done—the metric system, the system devised to represent the names of the chemical elements, and telegraphic communication.

1781,Uranus,"['Mercury', 'Venus', 'Mars', 'Jupiter', 'Earth', 'Venus Mars', 'William Herschel', 'Saturn', 'Herschel', 'Uranus', 'Uranus Bradley', 'Herschel Herschel', 'Newton']","['Saturn', 'Copernican', 'British', 'Hanoverian', 'Saturn Flamsteed', 'Saturn Cronos', 'Greek', 'Herschel']","Since prehistoric times, human beings had been aware of the five bright starlike planets: Mercury, Venus, Mars, Jupiter, and Saturn. With the coming of Copernican principles (see 1543), Earth itself became a sixth, coming between Venus and Mars. It seemed somehow impossible that there could be another. Surely, if there were another, it would have been seen.

In the 1770s, a British astronomer (of Hanoverian birth) began studying the heavens. He was William Herschel (1738-1822). A music teacher by profession, he had grown interested in astronomy. Unable to buy a telescope he considered sufficiently good, he took to grinding his own lenses and mirrors and ended with the best telescopes of his time.

He determined to study, systematically, ev-

erything in the sky, and on March 31, 1781, he came across an object that appeared as a disc instead of as a mere point of light. He supposed it to be a comet, but the disc had sharp edges like a planet and wasn't fuzzy as a comet would be. Furthermore, when enough observations had been made to calculate an orbit, he found that orbit to be nearly circular, like a planet’s, and not elongated, like a comet's. What’s more, it was clear that the object’s orbit lay far outside that of Saturn. It was twice as far from the Sun as Saturn was, and no comet could be seen from that distance.

The conclusion was that Herschel had discovered a seventh planet circling the Sun, which because of its great distance did not appear as bright as the others. In fact, it was visible to the unaided eye as a very dim star and had been observed a

number of times by people who never suspected it might be a planet. The first had been Flamsteed (see 1676), who had recorded its position on his star map a century earlier and called it 34 Tauri.

After some hesitation, astronomers decided to continue naming planets for mythelogical characters, and the new planet was named Uranus, after the father of Saturn (Cronos) in the Greek myths.

The discovery of Uranus doubled the size of the Solar System at a stroke. It was further spectacular proof that the ancients had not known everything, and gave astronomers the exciting knowledge that there was more to be discovered in the sky than additional comets.

. Binary Stars Astronomers were still trying to detect the parallax of the stars, the task that

Bradley had failed at a half-century earlier (see 1728).

It struck Herschel (see above) that he might be able to detect parallax if he studied stars that were very close together in appearance. Both would be in the same line of sight, but if one was considerably brighter than the other, it might be considerably closer. In that case, the brighter star should show slight parallactic changes of position in the course of the year relative to the dim star.

Herschel began the study of such stars in 1781, and as time went on, he did notice that one of the stars changed position relative to the other in a number of cases. In no case, however, was this change quite what one would expect if it had resulted from the motion of the Earth. In time, astronomers were forced to the conclusion that some double stars were actually close to each other in reality and not merely in appearance and that they moved about each other. Herschel had discovered binary stars, from a Latin word referring to objects that exist in pairs.

Newton had presented his law of universal gravitation, assuming that it was a force of attraction between any two objects in the Uni-

verse, but it had actually been tested only on objects within the Solar System. Now for the first time it could be tested on distant stars, where it was eventually proved to be truly universal.

"
1781,Crystallography,"['Haiiy', 'Haty', 'Hatiy']","['Crystal', 'Greek', 'French', 'Hatiy']","Crystal is from a Greek word for “ice” or “frozen.” Since ice is sometimes transparent, the word crystal came to be used for any transparent object. Thus, a fortune-teller uses a “crystal ball” that is a ball of ordinary glass. The planets were thought to be set in “crystalline spheres” because those spheres were transparent.

When quartz was found, it had the properties of rocky material, but it was transparent. Since bits of quartz often had straight edges, planar faces, and sharp angles, people began to speak of any solids with straight edges, planar faces, and sharp angles as crystals, even when they were not transparent.

In 1781, a French mineralogist, René-Just Hatiy (1743-1822), was handling a piece of calcite crystal that had a rhombohedral shape (a kind of slanted cube). Accidentally, he dropped it and it shattered. Haiiy noticed that the

pieces all had a rhombohedral shape. He broke more pieces of calcite and found that, no matter what the original shape was, it broke into rhombohedrals.

Haty suggested that each crystal was built of successive additions of what we now call a unit cell, which formed, in the absence of external interference, a simple geometrical shape with constant angles. He felt that an identity or difference in crystalline form implied an identity or difference in chemical composition.

In this way, Hatiy founded the modern science of crystallography.

1781,Axial Inclination of Mars,"['Earth', 'Binary Stars', 'Cassini', 'Herschel', 'Herschel Mars']","['North Pole', 'Martian', 'Martian Earth']","The Earth’s axis is tipped 23.5 degrees to the perpendicular of the plane of its orbit. It is this which gives Earth its seasons. When the Earth is in that region of its orbit in which its North Pole is tipped toward the Sun, the northern hemisphere has its summer and the southern its winter. When the Earth is in the opposite region of its orbit, with the North Pole tipped away from the Sun, the northern hemisphere has its winter and the southern its summer.  Do other planets have similar characteristics? Herschel (see Binary Stars, above) was studying the rotation of Mars—the manner in which its markings moved about it, which Cassini had used to determine the length of the Martian day (see 1665). It seemed to Herschel that the markings had to move parallel to the Martian equator and that its axis of rotation would have to be perpendicular to that. By determining the axis of rotation in this way, Herschel calculated that Mars had an axial inclination of just about 24 degrees, nearly that of Earth's. This was one more way in which Earth resembled other planets.

(see 1764), he kept introducing improvements. He arranged to have the steam push into a chamber on each side of the piston alternately so that it would be pushed rapidly in both directions rather than in only one.

In 1781 he devised mechanical attachments that ingeniously converted the back-and-forth movement of a piston into the rotary movement of a wheel, so that the steam engine could be made to power a variety of activities and machines.

The now-versatile steam engine was the first of the modern prime movers, the first modern device, that is, that could take energy as it occurred in nature and apply it to the driving of machinery. To be sure, wind and running water were the prime movers of ancient times, but wind is erratic, and run-

stellation). Algol did not vary in brightness as much as Mira did, but Algol's variations, unlike Mira's, were quite regular.

In 1782 Algol was studied by a British astronomer, John Goodricke (1764—1786), a deaf-mute. To account for the regularity of Algol’s variations, he suggested that it might

have a dim companion that circled it in our line of sight and periodically eclipsed it, hiding most of the light.

In this, he proved to be perfectly right, but not all variable stars are eclipsing variables. Mira isn't. Its variations are so irregular that no eclipse can possibly be involved.

1783,Motion of the Sun,"['Herschel', 'Herschel Herschel']",['Copernicus'],"To the ancients, the Earth was the motionless center of the Universe. To the early moderns, the Sun was.

In 1783, however, Herschel began a systematic measurement of the proper motion (see 1781) of a great many stars. Very dim and very distant stars moved so slightly they could be considered motionless and

were references against which the perceptible motions of the nearer stars could be measured.

As the years passed, Herschel found that in one direction in the sky, the stars were generally moving away from each other, while in the opposite direction they were very slowly closing in toward each other. In 1805 he came to the conclusion that this could best be explained by supposing that the Sun itself was moving toward

that point from which stars seemed to be separating and was moving away from the point toward which other stars s converging.

Just as Copernicus (see 1543) had maintained that the Earth was a planet like other planets, moving as they did, so Herschel now maintained that the Sun was a star like other stars and was moving as they did.

But if neither the Earth nor the Sun was the mo-

eemed to be

tionless center of the Universe, what was? There was no other candidate, and the question had to remain in abeyance for a time.

1783,Respiration and Combustion,['Lavoisier'],"['Lavoisier', 'French', 'Laplace']","Lavoisier, having worked out his theory of combustion as the combination of fuels with oxygen from the air (see 1772), thought of respiration. Animals ate food that contained carbon. They breathed air that contained oxygen and exhaled air that contained less oxygen and more carbon dioxide.

In collaboration with a French scientist, PierreSimon de Laplace (1749— 1827), Lavoisier undertook a series of experiments designed to measure the amount of heat and carbon dioxide produced by a guinea pig. It turned out that the amount of heat was about what would be expected from the production of that much carbon dioxide, and Lavoisier concluded that respiration was a form of combustion.

The essential point was that the laws that governed combustion outside the body seemed to hold inside the body as well. This was another blow against vi-

talism, the system of thought that gave life special status.

1783,Balloon,"['Benjamin Franklin', 'Jean Francois Pilatre', 'Charles']","['French', 'Paris', 'French Rozier', 'French Cavendish']","Light objects can be borne on the air, as all of us observe in the case of small feathers, dandelion seeds, and so on. If objects are light enough, they needn’t depend on wind and updrafts to remain in the air (or on muscular power as in the case of birds, bats, and insects). A light enough object can actually float in air, just as wood floats on water.

There are no known solids or liquids that are lighter than air, but some gases are. It occurred to two French brothers, Joseph-Michel Montgolfier (1740-1810) and JacquesEtienne Montgolfier (1745— 1799), that hot air expanded and was therefore lighter than an equal volume of cold air. If a quantity of hot air filled a light balloon, the hot air would float in the air and might have enough upward push to carry the balloon with it. In fact, if the balloon was large enough, there might be sufficient buoyancy to carry a human being upward.

On June 5, 1783, in the marketplace of their hometown, the brothers filled a

large linen bag, 35 feet in diameter, with hot air. It lifted 1,500 feet upward and floated a distance of a mile and a half in 10 minutes. They went to Paris, and on September 19, they managed a flight of 6 miles before a crowd of three hundred thousand that included Benjamin Franklin. The balloon carried up not only itself but a wicker basket in which were a rooster, a duck, and a sheep, which were not harmed. Finally, on November 20, a hot-air balloon carried into the air a French physicist, Jean Francois Pilatre de Rozier (1756—1783), and a companion. They were the first aeronauts in history. Meanwhile, a French physicist, Jacques-Alexandre-César Charles (1746— 1823), having heard of the hot-air balloons, realized that hot air had comparatively little buoyancy and lost that little as it cooled, though a fire in the basket underneath might suffice to keep it warm for a while. The gas hydrogen, studied by Cavendish (see 1766), was much lighter than hot air and had much greater buoyancy. What's more, the buoyancy was permanent. On August 27, 1783, Charles constructed the first hydrogen balloon and subsequently used one to

rise nearly 2 miles in the air.

In subsequent decades, ballooning became almost a craze, and it was also used for scientific purposes.

We call them globular clusters now and know that some consist of hundreds of thousands of stars.

To count all the stars all over the sky was, of course, impractical. He therefore took samples. He chose 683 regions, well scattered, and counted the stars he could see in each one. (This was the first application of statistical methods to astronomy.)

He found that the number of stars per unit area of sky rose steadily as one approached the Milky Way, was maximal in the plane of the Milky Way, and minimal in the direction at right angles to that plane. This, he thought, would be explained if the star system were lens-shaped, with the Milky Way marking out the long diameter of the lens all around.

Such a lens-shaped star collection had been supposed by earlier astronomers, but Herschel had now made it a matter of close observation. For the first time, the Galaxy truly took shape, although even then no astronomer had a

conception of its true size or of the vast number of stars it contained. Herschel thought it contained a hundred million stars—an enormous underestimate.,

1787,Uniformitar-,"['Buffon', 'James Hutton', 'Noah', 'Hutton', 'Sinai', 'Conrad Gesner', 'Mount Blanc', 'Michel-Gabriel Paccard', 'Jacques Balmat', 'Paccard']","['Earth', 'British', 'Great', 'Flood', 'Mt', 'Greek', 'Mt Swiss', 'French', 'French British']","o ianism Buffon’s attempt to estimate the age of the Earth (see 1749) had been strictly speculative. Another attempt was now made by a British geologist, James Hutton (1726—1797), who wished to base it on actual observation. He spent vears studying the rocks of every part of Great Britain carefully.

It seemed to him, as a result of his studies, that there had been an exceedingly slow evolution of the Earth's structure. Some rocks had been laid down as sediment and slowly compressed; some had emerged as lava and then been slowly worn down by wind and water.

The great point he made was that these changes were taking place very slowly and had been doing so in the past. Therefore, by measuring the rate

of change and noting how much had been accomplished at that slow rate, one could get a notion of how long the change as a whole had taken. This belief is called uniformitarianism (change at a uniform rate over the eons), and it was opposed to the opinion

that the Earth had been affected by sudden catastrophes such as Noah's Flood (catastrophism) in which huge changes could take place in comparatively little time.

Hutton published his observations and conclusions in Theory of the Earth,

which was published in 1785. He did not attempt to estimate the age of the Earth, but he made it clear that the Earth had to be extremely old, and that there was no trace of when its beginning might have been from what he could observe.

MountainClimbing Mountains are impressive, and because they reach toward the sky and their tops are not attainable by human beings without a great deal of trouble, they were often assumed to be the abode of gods. The connection of Mt. Olympus with the Greek gods and of Mt. Sinai with the God of the Bible are examples. Generally, human be-

ings admired mountains but avoided them. If it was absolutely necessary to get to the other side, they searched for comparatively accessible “passes.” Some climbing had been done for scientific purposes, however. Thus, the Swiss naturalist Conrad Gesner (1516~1565) had climbed mountain peaks in the Alps to search out alpine species of plants.

By the 1700s, however, scientists had grown increasingly interested in

mountains—in the plants and animals living there, in the nature of the rocks, and in the glaciers that frosted their peaks. The Alps were the mountains most available to west-European scientists, and their highest peak is Mount Blanc (French for “white,” because its peak is white with snow and ice at all times). It is 15,700 feet high. No one had climbed it, of course, and it was universally regarded as the act of a lunatic to try.

However, a prize was offered for the first person who could accomplish the feat, and in 1786 a French doctor, Michel-Gabriel Paccard (1757-1827), along with a porter, Jacques Balmat, won the prize.

As often happens once one person accomplishes a feat previously considered impossible, others at once find out they can duplicate it. Paccard’s climb initiated a virtual frenzy of mountain-climbing (among

British aristocrats particularly). Sometimes this was for scientific purposes, but often it was merely for the excitement and adventure of it, as was the case with ballooning.

1787,Charles’s Law,"['Charles', 'Charles Celsius']",['French'],"Amontons had discovered the relationship between the volume of gas and its temperature (see 1699). For some reason, the discovery was neglected. Charles (see 1783) rediscovered the relationship in 1787, however, and the French chemist Joseph-Louis Gay-Lussac (1778-1850) again rediscovered it five years later. The relationship is sometimes called Charles’s law and sometimes, Gay-Lussac’s law. Amontons remains forgotten.

The amount by which a gas shrank as the tempera-

ture decreased by 1 degree Celsius was '73 of its volume at 0 degrees. If the law held for all temperatures, a gas must shrink to zero volume at —273° C, which would be an absolute zero. This would be true, however, only if gases remained gases as the temperature decreased, and whether this was so or not was not known.

1787,Chemical Nomenclature,[],['Language'],"Language often stands in the way of scientific advance. This was especially

true in chemistry, since chemists had inherited from the alchemists a bewildering array of names for various substances. The alchemists had deliberately attempted to in e their reputations by speaking metaphorically and mystically, and since no two used the same metaphors, chemists could scarcely understand each other when they reported their work. Through the 1700s, attempts had been made to systematize the use of chemical terms and names for substances. Finally in 1787 Lavoisier (see 1769) and several coworkers pub

lished The Method of Chentical Nomenclature, in which a sensible and logical system was proposed. This was accepted by chemists over the next couple of decades, and finally chemistry had one language, which it retains to this day.

1788,Steamboat,"['John Fitch', 'Fitch', 'Trenton']",['American'],"Until this time, steam engines had been used only to power pumps and textile

machinery. Yet if a steam engine could turn a paddle wheel, it could also serve as a mechanical oar of great power, which could drive a ship through water against both wind and current without the expenditure of human muscle (except that of feeding fuel to the engine so that steam could be generated),

The first person to achieve a workable steamboat was the American in-

ventor John Fitch (1743~ 1798). On August 22, 1787, his first steamboat navigated the Delaware River for the first time. For a while Fitch kept up a regular schedule of trips from Philadelphia to Trenton and back. However, there were few passengers, the ship operated at a loss, the financial backers quit, and the ship was finally destroyed in a storm in 1792.

1788,Algebra and Mechanics,"['Geometry', 'Lagrange', 'Lagrange Geometry']","['Descartes', 'French', 'Analytical']","Geometry seemed a natural way of describing mechan-

could deal with geometric problems.

A French mathematician, Joseph-Louis Lagrange (1736-1813), tackled the study of mechanics in a totally nongeometric way. Using algebra

and calculus, he worked out very general equations by means of which mechanical problems could be solved.

He summarized his work in Analytical Mechanics, published in 1788 by a  very reluctant publisher. (A friend of Lagrange had to guarantee his purchase of any unsold copies.) It turned out to be a classic of science, although (as Lagrange boasted) there was not one geometric diagram in it. Geometry remains important, but Lagrange helped free the world of science from its unnecessary tyranny.

1789,Affinities,['Torbern Olof Bergmann'],['Swedish'],"Chemists up to this time had to take chemical reactions as they found them. Substance A would react

with substance B but not with substance C and that was all there was to it.

The Swedish mineralogist Torbern Olof Bergmann (1735—1784) had struggled to classify minerals and to make sense out of chemical reactions. He listed affinities—that is, the extent to which different chemicals interacted. He also prepared tables that made some sense out of the matter and helped predict whether certain reactions, not yet observed, would take place or not if given a chance.

His results were pub-

lished posthumously in 1788, and while they represented the barest beginning in the study of chemical behavior, they were a beginning.

the five satellites of Saturn discovered by Huygens (see 1656) and Cassini (see 1665).

A century had passed after Cassini’s discovery of Dione in 1684 without any

further satellite discoveries. Then in 1787, Herschel discovered two satellites of his own planet, Uranus (see 1781). He named them Titania and Oberon, after the queen and king of the fair ies in William Shakespeare’s A Midsummer Night's Dream, thus breaking with the traditional use of the classical myths.

In 1789 Herschel discovered two more satellites of Saturn, which were nearer the planet than the others were. He named them Mimas and Enceladus, after two giants who had rebelled against Zeus (Jupiter) in the Greek myths. Fourteen satellites were now known: Earth had one, Jupiter four, Saturn seven, and Uranus two. No more were to be discovered for half a century.

1789,Acids,[],"['Lavoisier', 'French']","Lavoisier (see 1774) had named the active portion of the atmosphere oxygen (acid-producer) because it was thought that all acids contained oxygen.

In 1789, however, the French chemist ClaudeLouis Berthollet (1748—

1822) showed that hydrocyanic acid and hydrosulfuric acid did not contain oxygen. To be sure, they are very weak acids, but it was eventually shown that hydrochleric acid, a strong acid, also did not contain oxygen.

"
1789,Conservation of Mass,[],['Lavoisier'],"Lavoisier in 1789 wrote the best textbook of chemistry the world had seen up to that time.

The most important generalization he introduced in that book was that in any closed system (one from which no mass was allowed to leave, and into which no mass was allowed to enter), the total amount of mass remained the same no matter what physical or chemical changes went on. This is the law of conservation of mass. For over a century it has been central to chemistry, and when it was

finally modified, it was only to make it even more fundamental.

He thought it was the element itself, and he named it after a planet, after the fashion of the medieval alchemists. Since the planet Uranus had been discovered only eight years before, Klaproth named his new element uranium. Neither he nor anyone else could possibly have foretold the significance it would come to have in the future.

In that same year, Klaproth also obtained a new oxide from the semiprecious jewel zircon and named the new metal contained in the oxide zirconium.

1790,Industrial Revolution,"['Slater', 'Slater Rhode Island']","['Great Britain', 'British', 'Britain', 'United States', 'Great Britain Samuel', 'Great Britain United States', 'United States Rhode Island', 'American', 'Pawtucket', 'United States Great Britain']","Great Britain's economic position was improving enormously with its ingenious new textile machinery and the manner of powering it by steam. It was easy for the British leaders to see that if they could retain a monopoly on this Industrial Revolution, Britain might easily become the strongest power in the world—economically, at any rate.

For this reason, what we would today call an “iron curtain”’ was clamped down. Blueprints of the new machinery were not allowed to leave the country, and neither were engineers who were experts in the new technology.

The new nation of the United States wanted the new technology to aid in its economic independence

from Great Britain, without which its political independence wouldn't amount to much. It therefore did its best to steal the knowledge by encouraging defectors. It found its man in Samuel Slater (1768-1835).

Slater was an engineer who knew the new technology intimately, but who also knew that he could advance only so far in the class-ridden society of Great Britain. The United States was offering money for his knowledge and he decided to go for it. He couldn't take any blueprints with him, of course, so he painstakingly went about memorizing every detail of the machinery. He then disguised himself as a

arm laborer and sneaked

out of the country. In 1789 he arrived in the United States and made contact with rich merchants in Rhode Island.

In 1790, working from

memory, Slater began building the first American factory based on the new machinery, in Pawtucket, Rhode Island.

In this way, the Industrial Revolution came to the United States, and once the process of proliferation began there was no stopping it. It continues to this day. Of course, when other nations try to make use of our technology in the same way that we made use of Great Britain's, we are, very naturally, indignant.

1791,Metric System,['Arabic'],"['Europe', 'French', 'Laplace', 'Lagrange', 'Lavoisier', 'Greek', 'Europe French', 'United States']","Throughout history, every nation, sometimes every region within a nation, has developed its own system of measurements. As long as trade was slow and communication was limited, that was merely an annoy-

ance. However, as the economic interdependence of pidly in

Europe increased ra  modern times, the absolute jungle of different measurements was a serious handicap to progress and prosperity. Yet tradition made it almost impossible for any region to give up its time-sanctified system for others merely because the others made more sense and were easier to use.

The French, however, in the grip of their Revolution, thought it a suitable time to develop a system of sensible measurements, and they appointed a commission to work on it, a commission including such men as Laplace (see 1783), Lagrange (see 1788), and Lavoisier (see 1769).

The commission tried

to base the system on natural measurements, so that the basic unit of length, for instance, the meter (from a Greek word meaning “to measure”’), was to be equal in length to 1/10,000,000 of the distance from the North Pole to the Equator. Other units were worked out to interconnect with the meter, when that was possible, while larger and smaller units were worked out by multiplying or dividing by ten.

This so-called metric svstent was by far the most useful and logical system of measurement ever dreamed up, and all that stood in the way of its instant adeption was, first, the dead weight

of tradition, and second, the hostility of the rest of Europe to the French Revolutionaries. Even so, it gradually spread, and today the metric system is used universally, except in the United States. And even in the United States, the metric system is used by scientists, and increasingly by others.

The metric system represented an improvement in technique, and like other such techniques (writing, the alphabet, Arabic numerals, printing, chemical nomenclature), it may not have advanced scientific knowledge in itself, but it made such advances easier.

In 1791 he returned to the Northwest in the ship Co-

lumbia. On May 12 of that year he discovered a river which he named Columbia for his ship, then circumnavigated the globe a sec-

1793,Cotton Gin,['Eli Whitney'],"['Great Britain', 'New England', 'American', 'United States']","The new textile industry of Great Britain, and the one that was just beginning to arise in New England, meant increasing demands for cotton, which could be grown with great profusion in the southern states. However, it was difficult to pull the cotton threads off the seeds in the cotton bolls, and that limited the quantity that could be produced. In April 1793, however, an American inventor, Eli Whitney (1765—1825), challenged to do something

about the problem, invented the cotton gin (gin is short for engine). It was a simple device in which metal wires poked through slats and entangled themselves in the cotton fibers. The wires were affixed to a wheel, and as the wheel turned, the cotton fibers were pulled off. One gin could produce 50 pounds of cleaned cotton per day. The effect on the United States was catastrophic. The southern states began to produce cotton in great quantities, and slaves were needed, also in

great quantity, to pull the bolls off the plants so that the gins would have enough to work on.

The southern states, which had been giving up on slavery, had to return to it now, defend it, and work up all sorts of ex its existence. Theyv developed an agricultural economy based on slave labor, which kept them poor, while the northern states grew rich on wheat and in dustry. And in the e brought on the Civi

However, in Christian Europe (influenced by tales of demonic possession in the New Testament), they were thought to be infested by devils and were sometimes mistreated physically in order to force those devils to leave. The insane were also treated as figures of fun, and insane asylums were thought to be amusing places to visit, though they were dreadful nightmares of howling, demented people, imprisoned and often subjected to the most brutal treatment.

A French physician, Philippe Pinel (1745-1826), thought that psychotics were sick in mind and deserved as considerate treatment as those who were sick in body. In 1791 he published his views on mental alienation; that is, on

minds alienated from their proper function. (For a while, physicians who specialized in mental disorders were called alienists, because of this.)

The French Revolutionaries, always ready to break with established custom, put Pinel in charge of an insane asylum in 1793, and there he struck off the chains of the inmates and began to make systematic studies of their conditions. He was the first to keep well-documented case histories of mental ailments.

It took half a century, though, for this civilized view of mental illness to penetrate the rest of Europe (and the United States).

In Ephesus, a stone was worshipped in the tem} ple of Artemis that was probably a meteorite, and periodically reports of witnessed falls were received.

During the Age of Reason, such tales were discounted and dismissed by men of science.

In 1794, however, a German physicist, Ernst

Florens Friedrich Chladni (1756—1827), published a book in which he suggested that meteorites did fall and that this happened because the space near Earth contained the debris of a planet that had once existed but had exploded.

This was the first time that a reasonable explanation had been offered for meteorites, and the tide slowly began to turn. It took a while, though.

A Finnish chemist, Johan Gadolin (1760— 1852), studied a strange mineral that had been obtained from a quarry in Ytterby (near Stockholm). Gadolin recognized it as a new earth unlike any previously known. He called it a rare earth to distinguish it from the common ones. From this rare earth and from others like it, a num

1796,Canning Food,"['Napoléon Bonaparte', 'Appert']","['French', 'Europe', 'French Spallanzani']","The trouble with food is that much of it doesn’t keep. Fairly quickly, it rots, sours, grows moldy. To preserve food for periods of time so that people don't starve over the winter, use must be made of drying, salting, smoking, and so on. A diet that depends on such foods preserves life but is monotonous.

The rising French mili-

tary leader Napoléon Bonaparte (1769—1821) realized the importance of decent food to an army that had all Europe arrayed against it and offered a prize of twelve thousand francs for some way of preserving fresh food for a long period of time.

In 1795 a French inventor, Nicolas-Francois Appert (1750-1841), began working on the problem. He knew that Spallanzani

(see 1768) had shown that meat would not rot if it was boiled for a long enough period and then sealed. Appert therefore worked out a system for applying this principle on a large scale, heating meats and vegetables and sealing them into glass or metal containers.

It took some years to perfect the process, but Appert's system represented the beginning of the canned food industry.

The English physician Edward Jenner (17491823) knew that in his native Gloucestershire there were tales to the effect that anyone who caught cowpox (a very mild disease, prevalent among cows, that somewhat resembled smallpox) was thereafter immune not only to cowpox but also to smallpox. (Since milkmaids almost invariably caught cowpox early and then never got smallpox, they retained a clear complexion. This in itself may have been enough to fuel the romantic cliché of the time concerning pretty milkmaids.)

Finally Jenner decided to test the matter. On May 14, 1796, he found a milkmaid who was undergoing an attack of cowpox. He took the fluid from a blister on her hand and injected it into an eight-year-old boy

named James Phipps who, of course, got cowpox. Two months later, Jenner inoculated the boy with smallpox in the manner usual for those days. The boy did not get smallpox. Two years later, he found someone else with active cowpox and tried again. It worked this time also, and he felt it safe to announce his discovery.

The Latin word for cow is vacea, so C()\\'pox lS vaccinia. Jenner coined the word vaccination to describe his use of cowpox inoculation to create immunity to smallpox. In this way, he founded the science of immunology.

Such was the dread of smallpox that the new technique was instantly adopted and quickly spread all over Europe. It was the first case of a serious and frightening disease that could be reliably prevented.

In 1796, however, Laplace (see 1783) had published a popular nonmathematical book on astronomy and, in the appendix, had made a similar suggestion, describing it in much greater detail. As the condensing cloud spun faster and faster, he explained, first one ring of gas, then another and another were given off. The rings condensed to form the planet, The planets, in condensing, gave off smaller rings that formed the satellites.

Laplace felt that certain nebulas visible in space were themselves contracting and represented planetary systems in the process of formation. His suggestion was therefore  it

called the nebular hypothesis. It proved very popular with astronomers for a time.

In 1796, however, a young German mathemati-

cian, Carl Friedrich Gauss (1777-1855), worked out a method for constructing a heptadecagon (a polygon built up of seventeen sides of equal lengths and sometimes called a seventeengon in consequence), using a compass and straightedge only. The Greeks had missed that construction, and Gauss's feat was considered the first notable addition to geometry since ancient times.

But Gauss did more than simply find a method

of construction. He showed that only polygons of certain numbers of sides could be constructed with compass and straightedge alone. An equilateral heptagon (a polygon with seven equal sides) could not be constructed in this fashion. This was the first case of a geomietric construction being proved impossible. From this point on, the proof of impossibility in mathematics grew increasingly important.

1798,Mass of the Earth,"['Earth', 'Cavendish']","['Newton', 'Earth', 'Cavendish']","Newton's equation for the gravitational attraction of one body to another (see 1687) contained symbols for the gravitational constant, the masses of the two bodies, the distance between them, and the acceleration of movement toward each other.

In the case of an object falling to Earth, the mass of the object, its distance from Earth’s center, and its acceleration were all known.

That left two unknowns, the mass of the Earth and the gravitational constant. If one of these could

be determined, the other could be calculated at once.

The gravitational constant was the same for all objects. If the gravitational attraction between two objects, each of known mass, at a known distance from each other, could be measured, that would allow the gi'a\ilaliunzsl constant to be calculated and, from that, the mass of the Earth. However, two objects of known

mass were sure to be so small that the gravitational attraction between them would be very tiny. Nevertheless, Cavendish (see 1766) tried it in 1798. He suspended a light rod by a wire attached to its center. At each end of the rod was a light lead ball. The rod could twist freely about the wire, and

even a small force applied to the balls in opposite directions would produce a measurable twist. Caven-

dish measured h twist was produced

ous small forces

He then brought two large balls near the two light balls, one on either side. The force of gravity between the large balls and light balls twisted the wire. Cavendish measured the twist and from that calculated the gravitational force between the two objects, That gave him the gravitational constant, and that in turn gave him the mass of the Earth.

The Earth turned out

to have a mass of 6,600,000,000,000,000,000,000 tons. Based on the known volume of the Earth, this made the average density of the Earth five and a half times that of water.

So precise was Cavendish’s experiment that this first-time calculation was very close to the value accepted today.

In a book published in 1798, he studied the anatomy of various animals to show how they compared with one another and did so with such excellence that he is considered the founder of comparative anatomy.

He introduced a new broad classification into the taxonomic scheme of Linnaeus (see 1735). Linnaeus’s broadest division was that of class, but Cuvier grouped various classes into phyla (singular phylum, from a Greek word for “tribe"").

Cuvier's eye for detail was such that he could tell whether fossil remains represented animals that belonged to one or another of the known phyla even though they were not members of any living species.

Everything he discovered seemed to imply the existence of biological evolution, but Cuvier remained frmly in the antievolution camp.

In 1798 he published a book, Essay on Population, in which he pointed out that population tended to increase in geometric progres-

sion (2,4, 8, 16 .. ) while the food supply tended to increase in arithmetic progression (2,3,4,5...).As a result, population would always outstrip the food supply no matter what happened, and the surplus number of people would have to be stripped away by famine, war, and disease.

This imparted a certain inevitability to disaster and misery, which could only be removed by lowering the birthrate. In a second edition, Malthus suggested delayed marriage and sexual continence as a way of bringing this about. It doesn’t take much of a cynic to realize that in the long run this won't work, but any suggestion that there are ways of lowering the birthrate without depriving people of the pleasures of sex is always met with strong disapproval on the part of the bluenosed.

Malthus did not grasp the role technological advance could play in warding off disaster, even though he wrote at a time when the Industrial Revolution was in its early stages. Because of such advances, the world population is now five times what it was in Malthus's day and the Malthusian consequence has not yet been paid. But  technological advance only delays, it does not stop, and the longer the delay, the more terrific the crash. Unless, of course, we lower the birthrate.

1798,Liquid Ammonia,['Guyton'],"['French', 'Morveau']","Water with substances dissolved in it melts at a lower temperature than pure water does. The French chemist Louis-Bernard Guyton de Morveau (17371816), by adding calcium chloride to an ice and water mixture, brought about a temperature drop to —44° C. He used this low temperature to liquefy the gas ammonia, which becomes liquid at a temperature of =332,

This was the first time a substance until then known only as a gas was chilled to liquid form.

1798,Interchangeable Parts,['Whitney'],['American'],"In 1798 Eli Whitney, who had invented the cotton gin (see 1793), was awarded a contract to manufacture ten thousand muskets for the American government. Up to that time, every musket (and indeed every device consisting of more than one part) had been made with each part adjusted to fit the adjoining part. If a part was broken, a new one had to be adjusted manually, A corresponding part from a similar device would not necessarily (and, in fact, would virtually never) replace the broken part without adjustment. Whitney, however, machined his parts with such precision that a particular part could replace any other one of that part. The story is that when the mus-

kets were done he brought some of them, disassembled, and placed them at the feet of a government official. Then, picking out parts at random, he put together a working musket.

The development of methods for producing interchangeable parts was an important part of the developing Industrial Revolution.

1799,Law of Definite Proportions,"['Proust', 'Proust Proust']","['French', 'Spain']","The French chemist JosephLouis Proust (1754—1826) was working in Spain at this time in order to escape the turmoil of the French Revolution and took part in a heated controversy over whether the composition of substances varied with the manner of manufacture.

Using painstakingly careful analysis, Proust showed in 1799 that copper carbonate contained definite proportions, by weight, of copper, carbon, and oxygen, no matter how it was prepared in the laboratory or how it was isolated from nature. The preparation was always five parts of copper to four of oxygen to one of carbon.

He went on to make a similar case for a number of other compounds and maintained that there was a general law of definite proportions, often called Proust’s law.

In this way, Proust could distinguish between mixtures (in which different elements could exist in any proportions, as in air) and compounds (in which

different elements mixed in definite proportions and no other).

1799,Strata,"['William Smith', 'Smith']","['Latin', 'English', 'Smith']","Many observers had noted that rocks existed in layers, or strata (the Latin word for “layers”). An English geologist, William Smith (1769— 1839), who was engaged in working on canals, had frequent opportunities to see the strata at excavation sites.

He became interested in strata to the exclusion of all else and, in 1799, began writing on the subject. Smith made a new point. Each stratum had its own characteristic forms of fossils, not found in other strata. No matter how the strata were bent and crumpled—even when one sank out of view and cropped up again miles away—its fossils went with it. In fact, it seemed to Smith, one could identify a stratum from its fossil content.

Since it could be reasonably supposed that a stratum nearer the surface was younger than one deeper down, the strata offered a method for working out an orderly history of

life from the fossils and even coming to some rough conclusions as to how long ago different fossils had existed as living forms.

1799,Perturbations,['Laplace'],['Laplace'],"In 1799 Laplace (see 1783) published the first volume of a monumental five-volume work called Celestial Mechanics, in which the gravitational influences on the various bodies of the Solar System were taken up in detail. Although the Sun dominates the system, and the planets move about the Sun in stately ellipses, each planet pulls at the others, and so do the satellites.

These small additional pulls introduce minor variations in the movement of the planetary bodies, called perturbations, and it was considered that they might gradually increase in size over time so that the Solar System would prove unstable in the long run.

Laplace showed that this was not the case. The perturbations are periodic and vary on either side of what would exist if the Sun alone had a gravitational pull. The Solar System, then, is stable.

two forms of Egyptian writ-

many scholars could read.

In the next few decades, the Rosetta Stone was studied in order to learn the Egyptian languages, so that from inscriptions and writings left behind by the Egyptians, vast stretches of Egyptian history might come to be understood.

1800,Electric Battery,"['Alessandro Giuseppe Volta', 'Volta', 'Volta Volta']","['Galvani', 'Italian']","Galvani, noting that dead muscle twitched when touched simultaneously by two different metals, had decided that electricity was involved and that it originated in the muscle (see 1780). The Italian physicist

Alessandro Giuseppe Volta (1745-1827) thought the electricity originated in the metals.

He began to experiment with different metals in contact and was soon convinced that he was correct. In 1800 Volta constructed devices that would

produce electricity continuously if it was drawn off as produced. This created an electric eurrent, which turned out to be far more useful than the nonflowing electric charge of static electricity

At first Volta used bowls of salt solution to

produce the flow. The bowls were connected by means of arcs of metal dipping from one bowl to the next, one end of the arc being copper and the other being tin or zinc. Since any group of similar objects working as a unit may be called a batiery, Volta's device was an electric battery —the first in history.

Volta then made matters more compact and less watery by using small round plates of copper and zinc, plus disks of cardboard moistened in salt solution. Starting with copper at the bottom, the disks, reading upward, were copper, zine, cardboard, copper, zinc, cardboard, and so on. If a wire was attached to the top and bottom of this battery, an

electric current would flow when the circuit was closed.

1800,Decomposition of Water,"['Volta', 'William Nicholson', 'Volta Nicholson', 'Johann Wilhelm Ritter', 'Ritter']",['German'],"The existence of Volta’s electric battery (see above) was publicized on March 20, 1800. Within seven weeks, it was put to work.

On May 2, an English chem-

ist, William Nicholson

(1753—1815), built a battery

of his own and passed an electric current through slightly acidified water. Bubbles of hydrogen and oxygen were produced in the water. The water had been electrolyzed and broken up into the hydrogen and oxygen that had been combined in its formation. Volta had shown that a chemical reaction taking place between copper and zinc in salt water could form an electric current, while Nicholson had shown that the reverse was also true, that an electric cur-

rent could produce a chemi-

cal reaction.

Later that year, the German physicist Johann Wilhelm Ritter (1776— 1810) allowed the gases formed in electrolyzing water to arise from two wires and bubble into separate containers. In one con-

tainer, hydrogen was collected, and in the other, oxygen. The volume of hydrogen was just twice the volume of the oxygen. Ritter also passed a current through a solution of copper sulfate, and copper appeared on the negative electrode. (This was one of the two metal rods sticking into the solution, the other being the positive electrode.) This was the beginning of electro-plating.

1800,Infrared Radiation,"['Herschel', 'Gas Lighting', 'William Murdock', 'Murdock', 'Nitrous', 'Humphry Davy', 'Davy']","['British', 'New']","It seemed natural to suppose that light, by its very nature, could be seen; light that could not be seen would be a contradiction in terms. Yet invisible light existed.

Herschel (see 1781) in 1800 had formed a sunlight spectrum and tested different parts of it with a thermometer to see if some colors delivered more heat than others. He found that the temperature rose as he moved toward the red end of the spectrum, and it seemed sensible to move the thermometer just past the red end in order to watch the heating effect disappear.

Except that it didn’t. The temperature rose  higher than ever at a spot beyond the red end of the spectrum. The region was called infrared (below the red).

How to interpret the region was not readily apparent. The first impression was that the Sun delivered heat rays as well as light rays and that heat rays refracted to a lesser extent than light rays. A half-century passed before it was established that infrared radiation had all the properties of light waves except that it didn’t affect the retina of the eye in such a way as to produce a sensation of light.

o o Gas Lighting In preparing charcoal from wood or coke from coal, little attention was paid to the materials that were heated and burned away. In 1792, however, a British inventor, William Murdock (1754-1839), began to collect the gases obtained by heating wood, peat, and coal, and found that they were inflammable. Being gases, they could be piped from place to place easily; could be easily lit and easily extinguished.

By 1800, Murdock had set up an experimental gas light, using coal gas. It was not long before gas lighting

was well established, and the large cities of the industrial nations and the betteroff homes were lit by flaring gas jets for most of a century. With better lighting by night, travel was safer, the crime rate fell, and the evening meal, rather than the midday meal, became the important social occasion of the day.

Nitrous oxide

New gases continued to be discovered. A British chemist, Humphry Davy (1778— 1829), discovered nitrous oxide in 1800. It was his rather risky habit to smell new gases and try to study the effects on the human body of breathing them. It turned out that nitrous oxide, on being breathed, gave one a giddy, intoxicated feeling and made one suggestible, so that one would laugh or weep immoderately or make other emotional displays. (The gas is still called laughing gas today.)

Davy reported that under the influence of the gas he felt no pain and suggested it be used as an anesthetic. It was indeed the first true chemical anesthetic and was often so used in dentistry. It also became a fad of the day, and some

people with nothing better to do would sit about a bowl of it and breathe it in order to experience the effects.

His careful observations (without a microscope) showed him that the various organs were built up out of a mixture of different types of simpler structures, each of which might occur in many different organs. Because these structures were usually flat and delicately thin, they were called tissues.

In 1800 he published a book called Treatise on Membranes in which he listed and carefully described twenty-one different types of tissues. He is for this reason considered the founder of the science of histology (the study of tissues).

1800. He kept his method secret and never allowed anyone in his laboratory. In this way he earned a fortune. He arranged to have his method published after his death.

1801,Jacquard Loom,['Great Britain'],"['French', 'France']","To weave textiles in such a way as to introduce patterns would ordinarily require people to work in a careful manner, producing certain motions here, but not there. It is not the sort of thing that one might think could be done by machinery. A machine

wouldn't have the “brains”

to do what human beings do only with difficulty. In 1801, however, a

French inventor, JosephMarie Jacquard (1752— 1834), invented what came to be called the Jacquard loom. In such a loom, needles ordinarily move through holes set up in a block of wood. Suppose a card containing holes in a certain pattern is interposed between the needles and the holes in the wood. Where there are holes in the card matching the holes in the wood, the needles pass through; otherwise,

the needles are stopped. In this way, a card might enforce, quite automatically, just the type of needle motions that would produce a pattern. Different cards would produce different patterns.

To be sure, devising the punched card required considerable intelligence and ingenuity in the first place, but once the cards were designed and in place, the machine did not need brains; it worked automatically.  The Jacquard looms spread rapidly throughout France and eventually through Great Britain as well. The holes in the card were a primitive kind of yes-no mechanism; a century and a half later a much more subtle type of yes-no mechanism would serve as the basis for digital computers.

Six years later, the German astronomer Johann Elert Bode (1747— 1826) popularized that series, which came to be known as Bode's law. Bode's law didn’t seem to have much scientific significance. Still, when Uranus was discovered (see 1781), it turned out to be just where Bode's law predicted a planet would be. That rather impressed astronomers. It so happened that Bode's law also predicted that a planet ought to exist in the space between Mars and Jupiter, but no such planet was known. It might be that it

was a small one and had gone unnoticed.

For that reason, another German astronomer, Heinrich Wilhelm Matthaus Olbers (1758—1840), began to organize a group that would take different portions of the sky and search them for any moving object that might be that planet.

While the preparations were under way, an Italian astronomer, Giuseppe Piazzi (1746—1826), who wasn't looking for the planet, came across it while he was working at an observatory in Sicily. It was a dim object, not quite visible to the unaided eye, that changed position from night to night. The discovery was made on January 1, 1801, the first day of the nineteenth century.

Piazzi began to follow its course. Since it moved more rapidly than Jupiter and more slowly than Mars, its orbit must lie between the orbits of those two long-known planets. Since it was much dimmer than either of those planets, it must be far smaller, too, and we now know that it is about 640 miles in diameter, smaller by far than even Mercury, till then the smallest known planet. That was why it had not been noted earlier.

Nevertheless, it fit

1801,Invertebrates,"['Linnaeus', 'Latin', 'Lamarck']","['Linnaeus', 'Vermes', 'French', 'Lamarck']","Linnaeus (see 1735) and others in the past threequarters of a century had elaborated the taxonomy of vertebrates (those animals with backbones—mammals, birds, reptiles, amphibia, and fish) in considerable detail.

The less familiar and more diverse animals without backbones (invertebrates) were less carefully considered. Linnaeus had lumped them all into the class Vermes (Latin for “worms”’).

The French naturalist Jean-Baptiste de Lamarck (1744-1829) tackled the problem in publications beginning in 1801. He divided the invertebrates into groups and created such divisions as the crustaceans (crabs and lobsters) and echinoderms (starfish and sea urchins). He distinguished between the eightlegged arachnids (spiders and scorpions) and the sixlegged insects. In fact, Lamarck was the first to use the terms vertebrate and invertebrate, and he popularized the term biology for the study of life.

In founding the modern science of invertebrate zoology, Lamarck began the process of understanding the importance of invertebrate life. All the vertebrates are included in but a single phylum, while there are about twenty-two phyla of invertebrates. The number of species of insects alone far exceeds the number of species of vertebrates; indeed, it exceeds the number of species of all other animals combined.

1801,Ultraviolet,"['Herschel', 'Ritter', 'Angelo Sala', 'Ritter Ritter']",[],"Herschel's discovery of in[rared radiation (see 1800) naturally created a stir. Ritter (see 1800) was also studying the Sun’s spectrum, but he was more interested in the chemical changes it brought about.

1t had been known for nearly two centuries that light broke down the white compound silver nitrate, darkening it (by liberating tiny specks of metallic silver). This was first reported in 1614 by an [talian chemist, Angelo Sala (1576~ 1637).

Ritter soaked strips of paper in silver nitrate solution and placed them in different sections of the spectrum to see how rapidly they darkened. He found that the darkening was least rapid in the red end of the spectrum and

took place faster and faster as one progressed toward the violet end.

Ritter, perhaps influenced by Herschel's experience, proceeded to place strips of soaked paper beyond the violet end, where nothing could be seen. There the darkening proceeded faster still. Apparently, there was radiation beyond the violet end of the spectrum as well as beyond the red. The new radiation was called ultraviolet (the prefix ultra is from a Latin word meaning “beyond”’).

"
1801,Light Waves,"['Thomas Young', 'Streams', 'Young', 'Young Young']","['English', 'Grimaldi']","The controversy over the nature of light—whether it consisted of a stream of particles or of tiny waves—had been going on for a century.

In 1801 an English physicist, Thomas Young (1773—-1829), began a series of experiments that seemed to settle the matter. He showed, for one thing, that the kind of diffraction noted by Grimaldi (see 1665) did exist.

Then too, he allowed two separate beams of light emerging from two narrow slits to overlap and found interference, for the overlapping beams showed alternate strips of light and dark.

If light consisted of waves, then the waves of the two bands of light

might move up and down in unison and reinforce each other in some places. In other places, one might move up while the other moved down, and they would cancel each other. Such interference is well known in the case of sound waves and water waves. Streams of particles, on the other hand, could scarcely produce interference effects.

It took a while for Young's demonstration to be understood and accepted, but once it was, it was seen that light was a wave phenomenon. The different colors of the spectrum marked out light with different lengths of waves (or different wavelengths). Short wavelengths are refracted (bent in their path) more than long wavelengths, so red light (the least refracted) has the longest waves, while orange, vellow, green, blue, and violet have successively shorter waves. From Young'’s work, it began to seem probable that infrared radiation had waves longer than those of red light, while ultraviolet radiation had waves shorter than those of violet light.

Because light cast sharp shadows and the diffraction effects were so small, light waves had to be very tiny. Young calculated from his interference exper-

iments that they must be less than a millionth of a meter long.

Two kinds of wave action are known, however. There are longitudinal

waves, in which the vibra-

tion is direction in which the waves are moving. Sound waves are of this type. In transverse waves, the vibra-

AC

and forth in the

tion is up and down in the

ght angles to that in which the v s are moving f

direction at ri

g. Water waves are of this type. Young

ather suspected that light consisted of longitudinal waves, but in this

he was wrong

In 1801 he reported a new element in the mineral, an element he named columbium in honor of the United States, which was sometimes known by the sobriquet of Columbia. There was, however, a dispute over whether the substance was really a new element or not. By the time it was finally decided that it was, its name had become niobium and that is now official, so the United States lost the honor.

The United States had a population of 5.3 million now, half that of Great Britain. Russia was the most populous European power with 33 million, but India

had 131 million and China 295 million. London was the largest European city with 864,000, but there were a number of cities in the Far East that had over

Ceres was so small, however, that it scarcely seemed to be a planet. Olbers’s group decided to continue the search.

In 1802 they discovered another planet between Mars and Jupiter, and they named it Pallas, one of the names of the goddess Athena. In 1804 they found still another, and in 1807, a fourth. These were named Vesta and Juno, after two of

the sisters of Jupiter (Zeus). The three new planetary bodies, however, were even smaller than Ceres.

Herschel (see 1781) suggested they be called asteroids (Greek for “starlike”), because in the telescope they seemed mere dots of light, like stars (because of their small size) rather than orbs, like the larger planets.

Eventually it was realized that there were a vast number of such bodies, perhaps as many as a hundred thousand of them, between the orbits of Mars and Jupiter. This region came to be called the asteroid belt. Ceres was the largest of the asteroids (hence the first

discovered), containing about a tenth the mass of all the other asteroids put together.

In 1803 an English chemist, John Dalton (1766—1844), advanced a summary of atomic thinking, backing it up with the evidence that had accumulated, including particularly Proust’s law of definite proportions and his own investigations of the way in which gases behaved. (In 1808 he gave his arguments formally in a book entitled New System of Chemical Philosophy.)

Essentially, Dalton returned to the Greek notions of Democritus (see 440 B.C.) that all matter was made up of tiny, indivisible particles. Dalton even used Democritus’s word atom for these particles. The difference was that Democritus’s theory was based on speculation only, whereas Dalton’s was based on a century and a half of careful chemical observation.

The Greeks, being geometers, naturally thought

that atoms differed among themselves in shape. Dalton, in whose time weight and measurements had grown important, maintained that the difference was one of weight, and he pioneered the concept of atomic weight.

For instance, 8 grams of oxygen will combine with 1 gram of hydrogen to form 9 grams of water. Suppose that water is formed through a combination of one atom of oxygen and one atom of hydrogen (the result would be a water molecule). In that case, one atom of oxygen would have to be eight times as massive as one atom of hydrogen. If hydrogen was supposed to have an atomic weight of 1, oxygen would have one of 8.

Of course, water might be made up of molecules containing any number of oxygen and hydrogen atoms. Dalton supposed it to be built up of one of each merely because that was the simplest possible situation. Until such time as more was known about molecular makeup, the values obtained for atomic weights would be dubious. In Dalton’s table of atomic

weights (the first ever compiled), many were indeed wide of the mark.

After a painstaking investigation, Biot gave it as his opinion that the reports were correct and that meteorites did exist and did fall from the sky.

They took the opportunity to test the

It occurred to a British inventor, Richard Trevithick (1771-1833), that what was needed was iron rails on which the wheels would fit and along which

they could move, a railroad.

He showed that, even if the rails were smooth and the wheels rolling on them were smooth as well, there was still sufficient traction for the locomotive to move itself and a train of coaches attached. Trevithick showed this by actual demonstration as early as 1801. In 1804, one of his locomotives pulled five loaded coaches for 9.5 miles at nearly 5 miles an hour. Nevertheless, Trevi-

An alcoholic extract of immature opium blooms was called laudanum and had first been introduced by Paracelsus (see 1556, Mineralogy).

In 1805 the German

chemist Friedrich Wilhelm Adam Ferdinand Serturner (1783—1841) isolated a chemical from laudanum that he found to be the active ingredient. It was much more efficacious in dulling pain and inducing sleep than the juice itself. It was eventually called morphine, from the Greek word for “sleep.”

Morphine has been an important adjunct to medical practice ever since, though its addictive effect was not at first understood. Its discovery initiated the study of alkaloids, which are important nitrogencontaining plant products with marked physiological effects even in small doses.

1807,Sodium and Potassium,"['Davy', 'Nitrous Oxide']",[],"By this time, some thirtyeight substances were known that are today recognized as elements; most of them being metals. There were some substances that were known to be oxides— combinations of oxygen with a metal—but the combination could not be broken up and the free metal could not be isolated. None of the ordinary chemical methods used to isolate other metals would work.

It was known, however, that an electric current would break up water molecules into hydrogen and oxygen when more customary chemical methods failed (see 1800). An electric current might do the same for the recalcitrant oxides.

Davy (see 1800, Nitrous Oxide) grew interested in the problem and con-

structed a battery with over two hundred and fifty metallic plates, the strongest ever built to that time. On October 6, 1807, he passed an electric current through molten potassium carbonate and liberated a metal, which he called potassium. The little globules of shining metal, when added to water, tore the water molecule apart as the metal eagerly recombined with oxygen, and the liberated hydrogen was heated to the point where it burst into flame. A week later, he isolated metallic sodium from sodium carbonate. The next year, by similar methods, Davy isolated the elements barium, strontium, calcivm, and magnesium. All were active elements that held on to oxygen tightly and would not have been isolated easily by non-electric techniques. These discoveries excited the scientific world

enormously and greatly stimulated research into electrochemistry.

But then the American inventor Robert Fulton (1765-1815) tackled the project, In 1807 he built the Clermont, 133 feet long. This vessel performed well, steaming up the Hudson from New York to Albany in 32 hours, maintaining an average speed of nearly 5 miles per hour. Soon he had a fleet of steamboats in operation, and unlike Fitch, he was commercially successful. For this reason, Fulton is usually considered the inventor of the steamboat,  1808

1809,Polarized Light,['Bartholin'],"['Iceland', 'French']","Bartholin’s discovery that Iceland spar showed double refraction and produced two rays of light (see 1669) had never been properly explained.

In 1808 a French physicist, Etienne-Louis Malus (1775—1812), was playing idly with a crystal of Iceland spar and found that

the sunlight reflected from a window produced only a

single ray of light after pass-

ing through the crystal. What's more, as he turned the crystal, the ray of light faded and the other one appeared. When the crystal was at right angles to its original direction, only the other ray of light appeared, the first having disappeared.

Malus felt that light might have different poles, as magnets do, and that one beam of light had its poles at right angles to the other. He therefore called the rays polarized light, and the name stuck even though his theory was wrong.

Polarized light turned out to be enormously useful to chemists.

1809,Mechanism of Evolution,['Zoological Philosophy'],['Lamarck'],"While the fact that biological evolution had taken place was suspected by many scientists, until now no one had suggested a mechanism that would allow it to take place. Why should some catlike creature in the course of generation after generation slowly change, some into lions, some into tigers, and some into pussycats?

The first to attempt an answer was Lamarck (see 1801) in his book Zoological Philosophy, published in 1809. Here he suggested that particular animals might use a part of the body steadily, or not use it, and that those parts might develop slightly or degenerate slightly as a result, and that such developed or degenerated parts could be inherited by their young, which, by use or disuse, would continue the process.

Thus some antelopes, by stretching upward to reach leaves, would gradually develop slightly longer necks and legs, which would be inherited by the young, which, also straining, would continue the process so that the giraffe would evolve. Other antelopes, by dint of constantly fleeing from predators, strengthened their leg muscles and became very fleet as the generations progressed. Water birds, by using their feet to push water backward, developed webs, while moles, who didn’t need eyes underground, gradually lost them.

This sort of thing is referred to as the inheritance of acquired characteristics. Experiments would show that acquired characteristics were not inherited. Nevertheless, the advancement of a mechanism for evolution, even if a wrong one, heightened interest in the matter.

Usually, however, human beings could only think of imitating the birds. The Greek myth of Daedalus had that legendary inventor building a frame to which he stuck feathers in wax and which he moved in birdlike fashion with his arms.

The first person to consider the principles that would really keep objects in the air was a British scientist, George Cayley (1773-1857). He visualized flying devices with fixed wings that presented appropriate surfaces to the air tails with control surfaces to allow turning and braking, and praopulsive mechanisms. He described all this in publications that began to appear in 1809.

In these he founded the science of aerodynamniics While the state of technol-

ogy at that time did not allow the construction of such devices, when they did

come a century later, they fulfilled Cayley’s requirements.

1810,Brain,"['Franz Joseph Gall', 'Gall']","['German', 'Greek']","In 1810 a German physician, Franz Joseph Gall (1758—1828), published the first volume of a four-volume treatise on the nervous system, In it he stated that the gray matter on the surface of the brain and in the interior of the spinal cord was the active and essential part, and that the white matter, deeper in the brain and on the surface of the spinal cord, was connecting

material. In this he was correct.

Gall believed that the shape of the brain had something to do with mental capacity and that different parts of the brain were involved with different parts of the human body. There was something to this, too, but Gall went much too far. He believed he could correlate the shape of the brain with all sorts of emotional and temperamental qualities and

that the shape of the brain could, in turn, be deduced from the superficial unevennesses of the skull. This marks the beginning of the pseudoscience of phrenology (from Greek words meaning “study of the mind”) in which character is supposedly analyzed by feeling the bumps on the head.

However, hydrochloric acid did contain chlorine, and Scheele (see 1774) had thought chlorine to be an oxygen-containing compound. In 1810 Davy showed this was not so, and that chlorine was an element. For this reason he rather than Scheele usually receives credit for the discovery of chlorine.

1811,Avogadro’s Hypothesis,"['Avogadro', 'Dalton', 'Again', 'Avogadro Avogadro', 'Avogadro Bernard Courtois', 'Third', 'Sulfuric']","['Italian', 'Amedeo', 'Latin', 'French', 'Davy', 'Greek', 'Russian', 'German', 'Gottlieb', 'Greek Berzelius']","It was clear that all gases expanded by the same amount as temperature rose, provided the pressure remained constant. In 1811 an Italian physicist, Amedeo Avogadro (1776— 1856), suggested that this might mean that all gases —at the same volume, pressure, and temperature— were made up of the same number of particles. This came to be called Avogadro's hypothesis.

If this is so, since water upon being broken up by an electric current decomposes into hydrogen and oxygen, with hydrogen having twice the volume of oxygen, then twice as many particles of hydrogen must be formed as of oxygen. This in turn makes it appear that water particles are not made up of one hydrogen atom and one oxygen atom, as Dalton had thought, but may be made up, at the sim-

plest, of two hydrogen atoms and one oxygen atom.

In that case, since the oxygen in water has eight times the mass of the hydrogen, the oxygen atom must be eight times as massive as the two hydrogen atoms put together, or sixteen times as massive as a single hydrogen atom.

Again, if all gases at a given temperature, pressure, and volume are made up of the same number of particles, and if the density of one gas is twice that of another, the mass of each particle in the first gas is twice that of the other.

Thus, the density of water vapor is nine times that of hydrogen at the same temperature, but since the oxygen atom has sixteen times the mass of the hydrogen atom, then the weight of the water particleis 16 + 1 + 1, or 18. Why isn't the density of the water vapor eighteen times that of the hydrogen? It may be because the hydro-

gen particles are made up, not of single hydrogen atoms, but of combinations of two hydrogen atoms. In similar fashion, Avogadro argued that oxygen and nitrogen particles were made up of two atoms each.

Avogadro distinguished between single atoms and these combinations of atoms that made up the particles of compounds. The combinations of atoms he called molecules (from Latin words for “small masses”). Thus, there was an oxygen atom, and there was also an oxygen molecule made up of two oxygen atoms. There was a water molecule made up of one oxygen atom and two hydrogen atoms. And S0 on.

Avogadro’s hypothesis, if fully applied, would explain a great deal about atomic weights and about the atomic consitution of compounds. Unfortunately, the hypothesis was largely ignored for half a century, and chemists re-

mained unnecessarily confused in many ways during that time.

A Russian chemist of German birth, Gottlieb ismund Constantin Kirch hoff (1764—1833), boiled ¢

suspension of starch in water to which a little bit of sulfuric acid had been added. If the starch had been boiled in water without the sulfuric acid, nothing much would have happened. With the sulfuric acid, the starch was destroyed, and in its place, a substance was produced that was freely soluble in water and that tasted sweet. It was a form of sugar, and it was named glucose, from the Greek word for “sweet.”

Several discoveries were made here. First, glucose was studied for the first time, and (as was eventually discovered) it is one of the key substances of living tissue. Second, it was the first hint that starch was built up of glucose units and could be broken down to glucose again. Third, the sulfuric acid that made the breakdown to glucose possible was not itself consumed in the reaction.

In later years, Berzelius (see 1803) gave the phenomenon of participationwithout-being-consumed the name of catalysis (from Greek words meaning “'to break down""). Sulfuric acid was an example of a catalyst that brought about the breakdown of starch.

1811,Catastrophism,"['Cuvier', 'Inguiry', 'Fossil Remains', 'James Hutton', 'Earth', 'Cuvier Universe']","['Cuvier', 'Greek', 'Machine', 'Laplace']","Cuvier (see 1798) continued to find important and interesting fossils. In 1812 he reported the fossil remains of a creature that clearly must have had wings and been able to fly but whose skeleton showed it to have been a reptile. It was named pterodactyl, from Greek words meaning “wing-finger,” because the membrane of its wing was stretched out along one elongated finger.

Cuvier could see that fossils represented creatures that were extinct and that the deeper the stratum and the older the remains, the less the fossils resembled modern organisms. Nevertheless, he couldn't bring himself to accept the idea of evolution.

Instead, in a book entitled Inguiry into Fossil Remains, published in 1812, he advanced the notion that there had been numerous creations, each one ended totally by some catastrophe and followed by a new creation of life closer to that of the present.

This view, called catastrophism, is usually considered the opposite of James Hutton's uniformitarianism, and for a long time the two were considered mutually exclusive. However, it is quite possible that Earth’s history shows peri-

ods of uniformitarianism interspersed by episodes of catastrophism (though none of the catastrophes, so far, seem to have been complete).

Cuvier was the first to go into detail on the appearances of ancient forms of life, and he attempted to classify them, as far as possible, by using the same system used for living species. In this way, he is considered to have founded paleontology, the study of ancient extinct forms of

life.

Universe as Machine

In 1812 Laplace (see 1783) suggested that if the mass, position, and velocity of every particle in the Universe were known, then the entire past and future of the Universe could be calculated.

In other words, he viewed the Universe as a vast automatic machine that, once set in motion, would follow an unswervable path. On the one hand, this would explain how God, with supernatural knowledge, could know all the past and the future, but on the other hand, it would remove any need for God, except to create the whole thing and set it in motion.

Wollaston (see 1800) in 1802 had observed a few dark lines in the spectrum but had supposed them to be boundary lines between the colors and had not followed up on the matter.

Meanwhile a German physicist, Joseph von Fraunhofer (1787—1826), was meticulously manufacturing the best lenses and prisms yet made. In 1814 he was testing one by sending sunlight through a narrow slit and then through the prism. In effect, he produced innumerable lines of

light, each an image of the slit and each containing a very narrow band of wavelengths. Some wavelengths were missing, however, so that the slit images at those particular wavelengths were dark. The result was that the solar spectrum was crossed by dark lines.

In theory, these should always have been visible, even to Newton, but if the prism was somewhat imperfect and the slit too wide, there would be enough fuzziness to obscure them. Where Newton had reported none and Wollaston seven, Fraunhofer, with his excellent instrument, detected nearly six hundred lines.

Fraunhofer went on to

measure the position of the more prominent lines, which he marked off with letters from A to K, and showed that they always fell in the same portion of the spectrum, whether the light came directly from the Sun or was reflected from the Moon or planets, Eventually he mapped the wavelengths of several hundred of these Fraunhofer lines, as they were called.

Not much was done with these spectral lines for the next half-century, but eventually they proved to be major items in the research armory of chemists and astronomers.

1815,Plane of Polarized Light,"['Malus', 'Biot']","['Berzelius', 'Biot', 'Iceland', 'Iceland Iceland']","Berzelius (see 1803) in 1807 had divided compounds into organic and inorganic. Organic compounds were those obtained from organisms (living or dead) or related to compounds so obtained. Those that had nothing to do with such organisms were inorganic.

Now Malus's discovery of polarized light (see 1808) gained some importance with a discovery made by Biot (see 1803). Ordinarily, the polarized light would be shining brightly in a certain plane, so that if two pieces of Iceland spar were lined up parallel, the light would pass undimmed through both.

If, however, the polarized light, en route from one piece of Iceland spar to the other, was made to pass through some organic liguid, the second piece of Iceland spar had to be turned for the polarized light to shine brightly again. This meant that the plane of the polarized light had twisted

on passing through the organic liquid. For some liguids, it twisted clockwise, for others counterclockwise.

Biot suggested that this might be due to some asymmetry in the structure of the molecules of the organic substance. He was right in this, but there was as yet no way of determining what that asymmetry might be.

He went on to show that the carbon-nitrogen combination (CN), or the cyano group, was very stable. In chemical changes, the two bound atoms tended to be transferred as a unit. Relatively tightly bound units that maintained their integrity through various chemical

changes came to be called organic radicals.

This represented a major step forward in the understanding of organic chemistry; that is, the study of those chemicals and chemical changes characteristic of organisms.

Two facts had already emerged. One was that the hydrogen atom seemed the least massive of the atoms, and the second was that other atomic weights seemed to be even multiples of the weight of hydrogen.

An English chemist, William Prout (1785-1850), therefore suggested in 1815 that hydrogen was the fundamental atom and that all other atoms were built up of different numbers of hydrogen atoms.

This is a classic case of

a scientist being far ahead of his time. Prout’s hypothesis was not taken seric and as time went on, atomic weights were sured that were not e> multiples of hydro that the hypoesis seemed to be disproved over and over. Yet a century after it was advanced, it turned out that Prout’s hypothesis had a large element of truth in it, although as usual in such cases, the truth was more complex and subtle than Prout could possibly have suspected.

He felt that trying to

hear the heart through the barrier of the breasts would be ineffective, while attempting to lift or separate the breasts for better hearing would be indelicate.

In a moment of inspiration, he bent a notebook into a cylinder and put one end between the woman'’s breasts and the other end to his ear. He was pleased to find that the heart sounds were actually louder than they would have been if he had placed his ear directly to the

breastbone. He therefore prepared wooden cylinders for the purpose of listening to the heartbeat and thus invented the stethoscope (from Greek words meaning “to view the chest”).

In 1817 they isolated a green compound from plants (indeed, the com-

What’s more, transverse waves could easily explain the manner in which Iceland spar divided a beam of light into two beams that were each refracted by a different amount. It also explained polarized light (see 1808), which longitudinal waves could not explain.

Ordinary, unpolarized light has waves that oscillate in all directions that are at right angles to its direction of propagation—up and down, side to side;, and everything in between. Light that passes through

certain crystals is forced to oscillate in just two directions, one at right angles to the other. This is polarized light. (This is analogous to making waves in a long rope. The wave can be made to move up and down, side to side, and everything in between, If the rope passes between the slats of a picket fence, however, the only waves that can pass through are those that move up and down.)

Fresnel's analysis settled the controversy over the nature of light, at least for the time being.

the orbit-establisher rather than to the discoverer.

Encke’s comet, the second to have its orbit established, returned to the neighborhood of the Sun every three and a third years. It was the first shortperiod comet known and, indeed, to this day no comet has been discovered with a smaller orbit. Encke’s comet was the first to be visible throughout its orbit, and this went far to decrease the mystery of comets. It is, of course, a very dim comet, since repeated approaches to the Sun have drained it of the material that goes into the forming of the tail. Nowadays it has just a trace of the fuzziness that reveals it to be a comet.

His atomic weight table was far more correct than Dalton's (see 1803) and was the first in which we can recognize many modern values, Berzelius also presented the molecular weights of various compounds.

Both have opposites (positive and negative in electricity, north pole and south pole in magnetism). In both cases, opposites attract and similars

repel, and in both cases, the strength of the attraction or repulsion declines with the square of the

distance.

For that reason, many scientists thought there might be a connection between the two phenomena. The results of one experiment were published by the Danish physicist Hans

Christian @rsted (1777— 1851) in 1820.

As part of a classroom demonstration, he had brought a compass needle near a wire through which a current was passing. The compass needle twitched and pointed neither with the current nor against it but in a direction at right angles to it. When @rsted

reversed the direction of the current, the compass needle pointed in the opposite direction but still at right angles to the current flow.

@rsted himself did not follow up on his discovery, but others did. Before the year was over, the French physicist André-Marie Ampére (1775-1836) had set up two parallel wires, one of which was freely movable back and forth. When both wires carried current in the same direction, the two wires clearly attracted each other. If the current flowed in opposite directions, they repelled each other. If one wire was free to rotate, then when the currents flowed in opposite directions, the movable wire rotated through a semicircle, coming to rest in such a position that the currents flowed in the same direction in both. Clearly, wires carrying an electric current showed magnetic properties.

Ampeére also demonstrated that a current flowing through a wire bent into a helix (similar in shape to a bed spring) strengthened the magnetic effect with each turn of the wire, and the helix clearly acted like a bar magnet with a north pole and a south pole.

In the same year, an-

other French physicist, Francois Arago (1786— 1853), showed that if a current ran through a copper wire, it could attract and pick up iron filings as easily as an ordinary steel magnet would.

Then a German physicist, Johann Salomo Christoph Schweigger (1779-1857), saw that the amount of the deflection of the needle in the @rsted experiment could be used to measure the strength of the current. In this way, he constructed the first galvanometer.

All these things together meant that by the end of 1820, the phenomenon of electro-magnetism had established itself firmly in physics.

® Glycine After Kirchhoff had isolated glucose from starch (see 1812), other chemists began trying to extract simple substances from complicated ones by heating in acidified water. What happened, it was eventually discovered, was that simple substances bound together by chemical bonds could be split apart, with a hydrogen atom from a water molecule added to one of the broken ends and the hydrogen-oxygen combination from the same water mole-

cule added to the other. This process is called hydrolysis (from Greek, meaning “to loosen by water”). Through hydrolysis, the simple building blocks of complex compounds could be isolated.

One of those who was interested in the procedure was the French naturalist Henri Braconnot (1781— 1855). He obtained glucose from sawdust, linen, bark, and other plant products, just as Kirchhoff had obtained it from starch.

Braconnot then heated gelatin, a substance derived from the connective tissue of animals, and obtained a simple substance that tasted sweet. He named it glycine, from the same Greek word that gave us glucose. (The letters u and y are interchangeable in transliterating Greek words.)

Braconnot might have thought he had a sugar, but on further investigation of glycine he obtained ammonia, so he knew its molecule must contain a nitrogen atom, which sugars do not.

As it turned out, glycine was one of the amino acids. Vauquelin had obtained asparagine (see 1806), and Wollaston (see 1800) had obtained cystine (from the Greek word for ""bladder™) from a bladder

stone. They were amino acids, too, but glycine was the first amino acid clearly associated with substances that later came to be called protein.

On November 16, 1820, an American sealer, Nathaniel Brown Palmer

(1790-1877), sighted land south of Tierra del Fuego. Also in that year, and perhaps several months earlier, a British naval commander, Edward Bransfield (ca. 1795-1852), sighted land in the same general area. At the time there was no way of knowing what the nature of the land was, but we now know that it is a long, curved peninsula that we call the Antarctica peninsula. It is the only part of the Antarctic landmass that sticks up well north of the Antarctic Circle.

Also in 1820, a Russian explorer, Fabian Gottlieb von Bellingshausen (1778— 1852), discovered a small island, which he named Peter

I Island, about 150 miles

south of the Antarctic Circle.

We might list Palmer, Bransfield, and Bellingshausen as joint discoverers of Antarctic land.

1821,Diffraction Gratings,[],"['Newton', 'Fraunhofer']","Since Newton's experiments with light (see 1666), scientists had used glass prisms to produce light spectra. In 1820 Fraunhofer (see 1814) was the first to find a substitute in a diffraction grating (closely spaced thin wires). Such gratings, the equivalent of fine, parallel scratches on glass, eventually replaced the prism in the study of spectra.

1821,Electrical Motion,['Michael'],['English'],"The discovery of electromagnetism continued to provoke a surge of experimentation. The English physicist Michael Faraday (1791-1867) set up an electrical circuit that included two wires and two magnets. In one case, the wire was fixed and the magnet

was movable. In the other, the magnet was fixed and the wire was movable When the current passed through the wire, the movable wire revolved about the fixed magnet and the movable magnet revolved about the fixed wire

In this way, Faraday demonstrated for the first time that electrical forces could produce motion.

This experiment led

Faraday to consider magnetism a field that stretched out from its point of origin weakening with distance. One could draw imaginary lines in the field, connecting all peints of equal magnetic intensity, and call these lines of force. Around a wire with a current flowing through it, the lines o for 3 cles, and it was this that caused the circular movement.

Here began the conception that today is very nearly central to physics: that the Universe consists of fields, of which particles are the origin. Lines of force, first visualized by Faraday (who had no mathematics but who had a terrific grasp of what must be) are of the utmost importance to the physics of today

1822,Glaciers,['Ignatz Venetz'],"['Mountain', 'Switzerland', 'Swiss']","Mountain glaciers were well known to people who lived in mountainous areas such as Switzerland. It was

known that they stretched down the declivities on the mountainsides like rivers of ice; that the end in the valley melted in the summer and refroze in the winter; that in advancing and retreating at the valley end, the glaciers scraped rocks, since the pebbles frozen into the bottom of the glaciers gouged striations into those rocks.

It was also noticed by some geologists that there were striations in rocks

that were nowhere near glaciers. It made sense to suppose that the striations could have been caused by glaciers, but how?

A Swiss geologist, Ignatz Venetz (1788—1859), decided there was only one explanation. Glaciers must, at some time in the past, have extended far beyond their present limits. He published material to this effect in 1821, but it made no great impression at the time.

1822,Heat Flow,"['Baron Fourier', 'Fourier', 'Fourier Analytical Theory']","['French', 'Heat']","In 1807 the French mathematician Jean-Baptiste-Joseph, Baron Fourier (1768— 1830) had been able to demonstrate what is called Fourier’s theorem. This states that any periodic oscillation (that is, any variation that sooner or later repeats itself exactly, over and over) can be broken up into a series of simple regular wave motions (expressed as sines and cosines), the sum

of which will be the original complex periodic variation.

Fourier used his theorem to study the flow of heat and in 1822 published a book entitled Analytical Theory of Heat, which amply explained that branch of physics.

In the book, he showed that it was necessary to use a consistent set of units and that, in equations involving quantities expressed as so many units, those units had

to balance on both sides of the equation just as the numbers did. This began the technique of dimensional analysis. Fourier suggested that the basic set of units should be those of mass, length, and time, and that other units be built up of those three.

About 1822 an English mathematician, Charles Babbage (1792-1871), began thinking of something much, much more ambitious. He wanted a machine that could be directed to work by means of punched cards as in a Jacquard loom (see 1801), that could store partial answers in order to save them for additional operations to be performed upon them later, and that could print the results.

Everything he thought of could be done, but not by purely mechanical means, using the techniques of Babbage’s time. He spent virtually the rest of his life trying to build the machine, his plans growing ever more grandiose.

Babbage had conceived the modern computer, but he didn’t have the necessary electronic switches. These were not to be developed for another century.

The fruits appeared in 1822, when he published a book on projective geometry (roughly, the study of the shadows cast by geometric figures). Previously knotty problems yielded easily to the new technique. The book is usually considered to be the foundation of modern geometry.

For once Cuvier made a mistake and thought the teeth were those of a rhinoceroslike mammal.

A couple of years later, Mantell came across the teeth of an iguana, a reptile that lives in desert areas of North America. The fossil teeth he had found were precisely like those of the iguana but much larger. Mantell realized then that he had uncovered an ancient reptile and named it iguanodon (from the

Greek meaning “iguanatooth"").

As it turned out, he was the first to discover an example of what were eventually to be called dinosaurs (from Greek words meaning “terrifying lizards”). Dinosaurs proved to be by far the most dramatic relics of past ages and did more to acquaint the ordinary person with the fact of biological evolution than anything else.

It was not till 1822, however, that a true decipherment was made, by a French linguist, Jean-Fran¢ois Champollion (1790— 1832), who realized that some signs were alphabetic, some syllabic, and some represented a whole word or idea. It was he who founded modern Egyptology

1823,Gastric Acidity,"['Hydrochloric', 'Johann Wolfgang Dobereiner', 'Débereiner']","['Prout', 'Davy', 'German']","Vitalism—the idea that the properties of life are fundamentally different from those of nonlife, in some respects at least—seemed to have a thousand lives as it retreated from one bastion to another. Surely there had to be an important difference between the gentle chemicals that made up flesh and blood and the harsh ones that made up the inanimate world? Among the harsh chemicals of the inanimate world are the strong acids. In 1823, however, Prout (see 1815) discovered that stomach secretions contained hydrochloric acid, one of those strong acids. Hydrochloric acid was thus part of the animate as well as the inanimate world. But why did it not scarify and destroy the stomach lining? Sometimes it does, for it can cause ul-

cers, but usually it does not, and even today we are not quite sure why.

Platinum as Catalyst

As early as 1816, Davy (see 1800) had noticed that certain inflammable gases seemed to ignite and burn more readily in the presence of platinum than in its

absence.

In 1823 the German chemist Johann Wolfgang Dobereiner (1780—-1849) found that the effect was heightened when he used powdered platinum. In fact hydrogen would ignite and burn in air without having to be heated if powdered platinum was present. Nor was the platinum consumed in the process. It was a catalyst.

Débereiner went on to devise an automatic lighter in which a jet of hydrogen

could be played upon powdered platinum, causing the hydrogen to flame at once. This could be used to light a cigar, for instance.

It wasn't practical, to be sure. The platinum was very expensive, and although it wasn't consumed, it was quickly poisoned by impurities in the hydrogen or in the air and then wouldn't work until it was cleaned up again.

In time, however, it was discovered that platinum (and also other, cheaper metals) would catalyze many reactions involving hydrogen, and such metal-catalyzed reactions became very important in industry.

1823,Isomers,"['Justus', 'Silver', 'Friedrich Wéhler', 'Silver Scientific Ballooning', 'Berzelius']","['German', 'German Greek']","With the coming of the atomic view of matter, chemists routinely tried to find out the atomic composition of the molecules of

the substances they were studying. In 1823 the German chemist Justus von Liebig (1803—-1873) was studying a class of substances known as fulminates. Silver fulminate, for instance, has a molecule in which there is one atom each of silver, carbon, nitrogen, and oxygen.

At the same time, another German chemist, Friedrich Wéhler (1800— 1882), was studying a class of substances known as isocvanates. Silver isocyanate also has a molecule containing one atom each of silver, carbon, nitrogen, and oxgyen.

Both chemists submitted their reports for publication to a journal of which Gay-Lussac (see 1804, Scientific Ballooning) was editor. He noticed that the molecular formulas were the same, yet the compounds had quite different properties. He told Berzelius (see 1803), who prepared both compounds and found that it was true: same formula, different properties. Berzelius referred to such unlike twins as isomers (from Greek words meaning “‘equal

This was the first indication that counting the atoms in a molecule was not enough; it was also necessary to consider the arrangements of those atoms.

The more complicated the molecule, the more likely it was that there would be numerous isomers. Since the molecules in living tissue tend to be far more complicated than the molecules in the inanimate world, isomerism became particularly important to organic chemists.

"
1823,Liquefying Gases,"['Michael', 'Chlorine']",[],"Generally speaking, there are two ways of making a gas condense into a liquid. You can cool it. This deprives the gas of energy, and its molecules sink toward each other and cling together. You can also put it under pressure. This forces the molecules toward each other until they cling. Naturally, if you use cold and pressure, you do better still.

Michael Faraday (see 1821) was the first to use cold and pressure in a systematic attempt to liquefy gases. He used a strong glass tube bent into a boomerang shape. In the closed bottom, he placed some substance that, when heated, would liberate the gas he was trying to liguefy. He then sealed the open end. He placed the bottom end in hot water. This liberated the gas in greater and greater quanti-

ties and, since the gas was in the limited space within the tube, it developed greater and greater pressure.

The other end of the tube Faraday kept in a beaker filled with crushed ice. At that end the gas would be subjected to both high pressure and low temperature and would liguefy. In 1823 Faraday liquefied the gas chlorine in this manner. (Chlorine’s normal liguefaction point is —34°C.) Using this method, Faraday liquefied several other gases, 100.

1824,Electromagnets,"['William Sturgeon', 'Sturgeon', 'Sturgeon Joseph Henry', 'Henry']","['Ampére', 'Greek', 'English', 'American']","Three years earlier, Ampére (see 1820) had shown that a wire helix (or solenoid, from a Greek word meaning “pipelike,” because such a helix looks like a pipe with its walls made of turns of wire) acts like a bar magnet when electricity flows through the wires.

In 1823 an English physicist, William Sturgeon (1783-1850), placed an iron bar within a solenoid of eighteen turns. He found that the iron seemed to concentrate the magnetic field and make it stronger.

Sturgeon varnished the iron bar to insulate it and keep it from short-circuiting the wires. He used one that was bent into the  shape of a horseshoe. His device would lift 9 pounds —twenty times its own weight—while the current was running. When the current was turned off, the magnetic properties vanished. Sturgeon had invented the electromagnet.

It was quickly im-

proved upon by the American physicist Joseph Henry (1797-1878), who in 1829 wrapped insulated wire around an iron core. This meant that many more turns of wire could be wrapped about the core, since crisscrossing them would not produce a short

circuit. The more turns of wire, the stronger the magnetic field when the current was running. By 1831, using the current from an ordinary battery, Henry could make an electromagnet lift a ton of iron.

The first improvement on the Roman system came in 1824, when an English stonemason, Joseph Aspdin (1799-1855), invented a method for grinding and burning clay and limestone to produce a cement that

was both cheaper and better than other cements in use at the time. He called it Portland cement in an attempt to emphasize its resemblance to Portland stone quarried at Portland, Dorset.

1824,Steam Engine Efficiency,['Carnot'],"['French', 'Fire', 'Greek']","The steam engine, however useful, remained inefficient. With all Watt’s improvements (see 1764), it still converted only 7 percent of the energy of burning fuel into

work. The remaining 93 percent (or more) was simply lost as waste heat.

The first to study steam engine efficiency scientifically was a French physicist, Nicolas-Léonard-Sadi Carnot (1796—1832). In 1824 he published a book entitled On the Motive Power of Fire in which he was able to show that the maximum efficiency of a steam engine depended upon the difference in temperature between the steam at its hottest and the cold water at its coldest. It does not matter what happens at

the temperatures in between; whether the steam cools or the water heats slowly, quickly, smoothly orin stages.

Carnot was the first to consider carefully the way in which heat and work interconvert. For that reason he is considered the founder of the science of thermodynamics (from Greek words meaning “the flow of heat”). From his work it was possible to deduce what came to be called the second law of thermodynamics a quarter-century later.

For the first time in the history of the world, land transportation at a rate faster than that of a galloping horse was clearly on the way to becoming possible.

an opening (or fistula) remained in his side. It was nearly an inch across and it led into his stomach.

Through this opening, Beaumont, beginning in May 1825, was able to observe the changes in the stomach under different conditions and to extract samples of gastric juice, which he sent all over the world. It was like having the benefits of a vivisection. Beaumont's work served as a source for much early information on the process of digestion and increased interest in the field.

The French chemist Michel-Eugéne Chevreul (1786—1889) had studied fats and worked out their chemical nature. They were combinations of glycerol with fatty acids. Each glycerol molecule could combine with three fatty acids,

and each fatty acid had a long chain of (usually) sixteen or eighteen carbon atoms. Chevreul was the first to isolate the most common of these fatty acids: stearic acid, palmitic acid, and oleic acid.

In 1825 he and GayLussac (see 1804, Scientific Ballooning) patented candles made out of these fatty acids. Such candles were harder than tallow candles, gave a brighter light, looked better, needed less

care while burning, and didn’t smell as bad. To the society of the time, this was a major advance.

It is possible to have difficulty seeing, however, even if one is neither, if the cornea of the eye is not perfectly

The British astronomer George Biddell Airy (1801 1892) suffered from astigmatism, and he was the first, in 1825, to design eyeglass lenses to correct that condition.

Non-Euclidean Geometry

Euclid had based his mas-

| sive structure of geometry, over two thousand years before, on ten axioms and propositions that could be considered so self-evident that they required no proof.

(One had to start somewhere.)

One of these axioms can be stated in a number of ways, of which the simplest is “Through a given point, not on a given line, one and only one line can be drawn parallel to the given line.”

This did not seem quite

as self-evident as Euclid’s other axioms, and the notion of parallelism implied the existence of lines of infinite length—not an easy thing to accept

Since Euclid’s time, mathematicians had desperately tried to prove that axiom from the other axioms. All failed to do so

e SN

Nearly a century before, the Italian mathematician Girolamo Saccheri (1667—1733) had been struck with the idea of beginning by supposing that the axiom was not true. He could then proceed to build a geometry on that basis and, sooner or later, arrive at a contradiction. He could then conclude that the axiom was true. That having been proved, it would no longer be viewed as an axiom.

However, he could find no contradiction, and this made him so uncomfortable that he imagined he had found a contradiction and, in 1733, published a book entitled Euclid Cleared of Every Flaw, in which he claimed he had proved the axiom—but hadn't.

Finally, in 1826, a Russian mathematician, Nikolay Ivanovich Lobachevsky (1792-1856), got onto the same track, but he went farther. The axiom, he de-

cided, was not an axiom because it was not needed; geometry could be made self-consistent without it. He showed that if one began with an axiom that stated “Through a given point, not on a given line, any number of lines can be drawn parallel to a given line,"" then that and the remaining axioms of Euclid could be used to draw up a new “‘non-Euclidean” geometry. It would be different from the ordinary kind, but it would be self-consistent

Lobachevsky published his ideas in 1829 and was first in the field. A Hungarian mathematician, Janos Bolyai (1802-1860), had as early as 1823 worked out the same non-Euclidean geometry. However, his publication was delayed till 1832, so Lobachevsky got the credit.

Gauss (see 1797) had actually worked out the idea of non-Euclidean ge-

ometry as early as 1816 but had lacked the courage to publish it.

The French chemist Antoine-Jérome Balard (1802—1876), also working with seaweed, found that at times he obtained a brown substance in solution in the liquid he was using to dissolve the ashes of the seaweed. In 1826 he tracked this color to a substance that had properties apparently just midway between those of chlorine and iodine. For a while he thought he had a compound of those two elements, but further investigation convinced him he had a new element, which he called bromine, from the Greek word for “smell,” because of its strong odor.

1827,Ohm’s Law,"['Fourier', 'Whereas', 'Georg Simon Ohm', 'Ohm']",['German'],"After Fourier had worked out the mathematical system that described the flow of heat adequately (see 1822), it seemed that the same system might be used to describe the flow of electricity. Whereas heat flow from point to point depended on the temperatures of the two points and the heat conductivity of the material between, so electric flow from point to point might depend on

the electrical potential

of the two points and on the electrical conduct-

ivity of the material between.

By working with wires of different thicknesses and lengths, the German physicist Georg Simon Ohm (1789-1854) found that the quantity of current transmitted was inversely proportional to the length of the wire and directly proportional to its cross-sectional area. He was in this way able to define the resistance of the wire and, in 1827, showed that, “The flow of current through a conductor is directly proportional to the potential difference and inversely

proportional to the resistance.” This is called Ohm's law,

1827,Turbines,"['Benoit Fourneyron', 'Fourneyron']",['French'],"Waterwheels had been in use since ancient times, with the water hitting the vanes on the outer edge of the wheel. A French engineer, Benoit Fourneyron (1802-1867), heard his teacher talk of a new kind of waterwheel that he called a turbine (from a Latin word meaning “whirling”). The water would come down the hub and move out to the vanes, setting the wheel turning. The faster the wheel turned, the faster the water would be thrown out against the vanes. In the end, the wheel would turn much more rapidly and deliver far more power than an ordinary waterwheel.,

Such a turbine existed only in theory, but in 1827 Fourneyron built one that developed 6 horsepower. Within a few years, he built one that developed 50 horsepower. The thought of a turbine driven by steam oceurred to him, but he lacked materials capable of

withstanding the high temperature. The steam turbine had to wait another half-century to come into existence.

1827,Screw Propeller,['Robert Wilson'],['British'],"Steamships were propelled by large paddlewheels on one side during the quarter-century of their existence. They worked well enough ordinarily, but in rough seas they could lift out of the water altogether if the ship listed to the other side, and that complicated steering. Furthermore, they were vulnerable to enemy fires so that it was considered completely impractical to power warships by steam.

In 1827, however, a British engineer, Robert Wilson (1803—1882), designed a screw propeller, which worked from the stern of the ship, so that it was symmetrically placed and was little affected by the ship’s rolling. It was also well under water and so less vulnerable than the rest of the ship. Since it was judged to be a more efficient propulsion mechanism than the paddlewheel,  - b

it became possible to think of steam-powered warships thereafter.

It was this much smaller structure, seen only through a microscope, that was the mammalian egg, or ovion (plural ova).

1827,Food Classification,['Prout'],[],"Prior to this time, food was seen to differ in appear-

hunger was assumed to be as good as anything else that did the same.

However, as chemistry developed, it became clear that foods differed in chemical nature and therefore might be different in their effect on the human body. The first to make a broad classification of foodstuffs on a chemical basis was Prout (see 1815) who, in 1827, divided food into three broad classes, which today we call carbohydrates, fats, and proteins. Naturally, this classification was not exhaustive, and there are important substances that do not fall into any of these groups— some of them present in only small quantities, but vital nevertheless.

Prout’s classification, however, was a good start toward understanding some of the complexities of dietetics.

1828,Brownian Motion,"['Robert Brown', 'Brown']","['British', 'Brownian']","In 1827 the British botanist Robert Brown (1773—1858) was studying a water suspension of pollen grains

under a microscope and noted that the individual grains were moving about irregularly. This had nothing to do with water currents, for the water was still, and besides, while some grains moved in one direction, others would move in the opposite direction, and still others in all directions between.

Brown was at first not surprised. Pollen grains had sparks of life in them, of course, and the motion might be an aspect of life. However, just to check the matter, he then studied a suspension of dye particles, each about the size of a pollen grain, and unquestionably not alive. To his surprise, the dye particles moved precisely as the pollen grains did.

Brown reported the observation, and the phenomenon has been called Brownian motion ever since. It seemed a small thing and had no explanation at the time, but eighty years later it offered scientists the final proof of the existence of atoms.

1828,Synthetic Urea,['Wéhler'],"['Wohler', 'Berzelius']","The vitalist view on the separation of chemicals into organic and inorganic was that only living tissue could create organic molecules.

In 1828, however, Wohler (see 1825) found otherwise, even though, at the time, he was making no attempt to form an organic compound. He was simply heating ammonium cyanate, which was accepted as a definitely inorganic substance, when he found crystals forming that resembled those of urea, which was the chief mammalian waste product disposed of in urine (including human urine). He tested the crystals and found they were ureca.

Both ammonium cyanate and urea have molecules composed of the same atoms (two nitrogen, four hydrogen, a carbon, and an oxygen) but differently arranged. They are isomers (see 1823). Yet ammonium cyanate was considered inorganic, was not found in

tissue, and could be formed by the chemist in the laboratory—where urea could now be formed also.

On February 22, 1828, Wéhler announced his discovery to Berzelius (see 1803), and the latter eventually conceded the point. Now other chemists began trying to synthesize organic compounds—and succeeded. Another vitalist bastion had fallen.

1828,Notochord,['Baer'],['Baer'],"Beginning in 1828, Baer (see 1827) published a twovolume textbook on embryology. In it he pointed out that, in early stages of their development, vertebrate embryos were quite similar, even among creatures that in the end were very dissimilar.

Small structures in different embryos, scarcely distinguishable from each other at first, might develop into a wing in one case, an arm in another, a paw in a third, a fin in a

fourth, and a flipper in a fifth. Baer believed that relationships among animals could be deduced more properly by comparing embryos than by comparing adult structures, so that he is considered the founder of comparative embryology.

In particular, Baer pointed out that early vertebrate embryos possessed a notochord for a short period of time. The notochord is a stiff rod running the length of the back. Some very primitive fishlike creatures possess such a structure throughout life, but in vertebrates, it is quickly replaced by a spinal cord. Nevertheless, the temporary existence of the notochord in vertebrate embryos shows their relationship to the primitive creatures.

1830,Nicol Prism,['William Nicol'],"['Biot', 'Scottish', 'Iceland', 'Canadian', 'Nicol']","Biot had noted that the plane of polarized light seemed to twist when it passed through certain organic compounds that were liquid or in solution (see 1815), but the fact was of little use without some simple method of measuring this twist accurately.

In 1829 the Scottish physicist William Nicol (1768-1851) devised a useful instrument in this connection by cementing two crystals of Iceland spar to-

gether with Canadian balsam. He put them together in such a way that one of the two rays of light refracted by the first crystal was reflected out of the side of the crystal at the layer of balsam, while the ather, striking the balsam at a slightly different angle, passed through to the other end of the crystal.

The one beam that appeared at the other end of the Nicol prism could then pass through a second Nicol prism without being weakened, if the second

prism was lined up parallel to the first. If the polarized light was then allowed to pass through a container of organic liquid or solution that was placed between the prisms, and if the plane of polarization was twisted as a result, then the second prism would have to be turned to allow the beam through at maximum brightness. The degree of twist could be easily measured, and polarimetry became a practical technique.

The presence of colored fuzziness effectively hid the fine details of what could be seen.

In 1830, however, an achromatic microscope was invented by a British optician, Joseph Jackson Lister (1786—1869). Using it he could see red blood corpuscles in detail for the first time and found that they were biconcave disks, rather like candy Lifesavers in which the holes had not been punched through.

It was only with achromatic microscopes that bacteria could be usefully studied.

birthday. Even so, he managed to generalize the work of Abel, who had shown the impossibility of solving equations of the fifth degree by algebraic methods (see 1824).

Galois went on to show that no equation of any degree higher than the fourth could be so solved. In order to do this, he invented a mathematical technique called group theory, which turned out to be useful a century later in working out quantum mechanics, one of the two great physical theories developed in the twentieth century that successfully describe the Universe.

For one thing Hutton was not an inspiring writer and his chief opponent, Cuvier, the supporter of catastrophism (see 1812), was.

In 1830, however, the first volume of The Principles of Geology appeared. Written by a British geologist, Charles Lyell (1797—

1875), it was to run to three volumes. All were clearly and attractively written and explained the uniformitarian theory so well that it finally achieved popularity. The extreme catastrophism of Cuvier and his followers thus went down to defeat. This is not to say that the pendulum doesn't swing and that certain catastrophes in the course of Earth'’s history did not take place. Earth’s development is now viewed as mainly, but not entirely, uniformitarian.  1831

1830,Electric Generators,['Suppose'],[],"Since @rsted had shown that an electric current could produce a magnetic effect (see 1820), it had seemed to Faraday (see 1821) that there ought to be some way of showing that the reverse was also true, that a magnet could induce an electric current.

To do this, Faraday made use of an iron ring. In 1831, he wound a coil of

wire around one portion of the iron ring and attached it to a battery. The circuit could be opened or closed by a key. If he closed the circuit, current would flow, and a magnetic field would be set up and concentrated in the iron ring.

Suppose, then, that a second coil was wrapped around another segment of the iron ring and connected to a galvanometer. The magnetic field set up in the iron ring might produce a current in this second coil,

and the galvanometer i would record its presence. The experiment worked. Faraday had devised the first electrical transformer and had discovered electromagnetic induction. However, it did not work as he had expected. There was no continuous electric current to match the continuous presence of the magnetic field. Instead, there was a momentary flash of current, marked by a jerk of the galvanometer’s needle when he closed the  circuit, and a second flash, in the opposite direction, when he opened the circuit.

Faraday explained this by means of the lines of force that he had visualized. When a circuit was closed and electricity was set to flowing, magnetic lines of force sprang outward and crossed the second coil, inducing an electric current. When the circuit was opened again, the magnetic lines of force collapsed inward and crossed the second coil again, inducing an electric current in the opposite direction. When the magnetic lines remained in place because the current in the first coil was flowing steadily, no lines crossed the second coil in either direction and no current was induced in it.

Faraday went on to devise a way of having metal cut across the lines of force continually. He turned a copper wheel so that its rim passed between the poles of a permanent horseshoe magnet. As long as the copper wheel turned, its rim continually cut through magnetic lines of force and an electric current flowed continually in the wheel. That current could be led off and made to do work. Faraday had thus devised the first electric generator.

Until then, electric current had been produced only by batteries, which meant that the electricity was obtained by burning metals such as zinc. This meant that electricity was expensive and limited in quantity.

The turning of the copper wheel to cut across the magnetic lines of force took considerable effort, and it was this energy that was turned into electricity. If one had to turn the wheel by muscle power, little electricity could be obtained. However, the wheel could be and eventually was driven by steam power, which meant that the electricity was formed from burning fuel or from some other copious source of energy such as falling water or blowing wind.

Eventually, when the electric generator was sufficiently improved, electricity could be generated cheaply and in any quantity desired.

"
1830,Electric Motors,"['Henry', 'Henry Henry']",['Henry'],"Henry (see 1823) discovered electrical induction independently of Faraday, but the latter published first by a few months and gets the credit. Henry went on to study the reverse process. If the rotary motion of a copper wheel cutting across

magnetic lines of force can induce an electric current, then an electric current ought to be able to produce a rotary motion.

In essence, Faraday had already shown this in a simple way (see 1821), but in 1831 Henry devised a much more practical version of such a machine, one in which a wheel would turn if electric current was supplied. This was the first practical electric motor (from a Latin word meaning “to move'"").

The importance of the motor cannot be overemphasized. A motor can be made as large or as small as desired. It can be run by electricity brought to it over a distance of many miles. Most important of all, it can (unlike a steam engine) be started in a moment and stopped in a moment.

The supply of cheap, abundant electricity made possible by Faraday'’s discovery of the generator (once it was sufficiently improved) would have been useless without some means of putting it conveniently to work. Henry’s motor (once it was sufficiently improved) did that, so that between them, Faraday and Henry ushered in the age of electricity.

1830,Matches,['Charles Sauria'],['French'],"For thousands of years, fires had been started by means of friction—f{riction that entailed considerable effort.

Then, beginning with the discovery of phosphorus (see 1669), chemists began to discover chemicals so active that with very little encouragement they could burst into flame. Why not, then, simply coat the edge of a splint of wood with some appropriate chemical that could at the proper time burst into flame and set the wood on fire? You would then have a small fire that would last long enough to ignite a larger and longer-lasting one. You would then have a match (from an old word for the nozzle of a lamp).

Such chemical matches began to be produced in the early 1800s, but the first to be made were too hard to ignite, or too messy, or t0o dangerously easy to light.

In 1831, however, a French chemist, Charles Sauria, produced the first practical friction match. It contained phosphorus, which was diluted with other materials so that the matches would not start to flame until they were struck on a rough surface. The moderate amount of heat induced by the friction would then suffice to ignite

it. Such matches produced flame quickly and quietly when struck, and didn'’t deteriorate on standing. Their use quickly spread.

There was one catch. The phosphorus used in the matches was quite poisonous, and people who worked at producing the matches would get the phosphorus into their bodies where it caused bone degeneration and killed them slowly and painfully. It took some seventy years before this was corrected.

The general (and rather natural) feeling was that the magnetic poles would be near, or perhaps exactly at, the rotational poles. However, the Arctic and Antarctic regions of Earth, cold and desolate as they were, could only be explored with great difficulty. It was not until June 1, 1831, that the North Magnetic Pole was actually reached. The feat was accomplished by a Scottish explorer, James Clark Ross (1800-1862). He found his compass pointing straight down, on the western shore

of Boothia Peninsula, at 70.85 degrees North Latitude and 96.77 degrees West Longitude. The pole was discovered only because it was 2,100 miles from the geographic North Pole and therefore relatively accessible. In fact, it was only a few hundred miles north of the Arctic Circle.

1833,Laws of Electrolysis,"['Davy', 'Franklin', 'William Whewell']","['Davy', 'Greek', 'Greek British']","In his youth, Faraday (see 1821) had worked under Davy (see 1800) and carried on the elder’s work in electrochemistry. The method whereby Davy had liberated a number of new metals, by passing an electric current through molten compounds of those metals, Faraday named electrolysis (from Greek words meaning “to loosen by electricity”).

Faraday named a liguid or a solution that could conduct electricity an electrolyte. The metal rods inserted into the liquid or solution he called electrodes

(from Greek words meaning “the road of electricity""). The positively charged electrode he called the anode (high road) and the negatively charged electrode he called the cathode (low road). This likened the flow of electricity to the flow of water from the height of the anode to the depth of the cathode, following Franklin's guess that electricity flowed from positive to negative (see 1752). (In fact, that turned out to be wrong, however, and electricity flowed from the negative electrode to the positive.)

All these names were suggested to Faraday by the British scholar William Whewell (1794-1866), who

also coined the word scientist in the next decade.

In 1832 Faraday announced what are now called his laws of electrolysis. They are:

1. The mass of substance liberated at an electrode during electrolysis is proportional to the quantity of electricity driven through the solution.

2. The mass liberated by a given quantity of electricity is proportional to the atomic weight of the element liberated and inversely proportional to the combining power of the element—that is, to the number of atoms that one atom of the element will combine with.

In 1833 he reported the separation of a substance from malt extract that had the property of hastening the conversion of starch to

glucose. Payen called the substance diastase, from a Greek word for “separate,” for in a sense, it separated the building blocks of starch and produced the individual glucose units. This was an example of an organic catalyst. Yeast is an organic catalyst that was known even to prehistoric humanity, but yeast is a living organism. Diastase was the first organic cata-

lyst to be isolated from living material that would display catalytic activity without being a living organism itself.

Diastase is an example of what later came to be called an enzyme, and it was the first enzyme to be prepared in concentrated form. Because of it, the suffix -ase eventually came to be used in the names of enzymes generally.

1834,Mechanical Reaper,"['Cyrus Hall McCormick', 'McCormick']","['Agriculture', 'American', 'United States']","Agriculture had always been a labor-intensive occupation, particularly at harvest time, when there was often a shortage of hands to reap and gather the grain. Attempts were there-

fore made to devise a mechanical reaper, and the one that finally proved successful was built by an American inventor, Cyrus Hall McCormick (1809— 1884). He first built what came to be called the McCormick reaper in 1831 and he secured a patent for it in 1834.

It wasn't immediately successful, but McCormick pushed it with great pertinacity, and little by little, it took hold, particularly in the vast grain fields of the American Midwest

This began a whole series of mechanical inven tions that gradually reduced the number of la borers that had to work the land to produce food, until finally, in a thoroughly industrialized nation such as the United States, a work force of 4 percent of the whole suffices to grow food for itself and for the remaining 96 percent, with enough left over to export.

"
1835,Celiulose,"['Payen', 'Cane']",['Payen'],"Having discovered diastase the year before, Payen (see 1833) went on to study the chemical composition of wood. From wood he obtained a substance that cer-

tainly wasn't starch but that could be broken down to glucose units as starch could. Because he obtained it from cell walls, he named it cellulose.

Sugars like glucose, and substances that can be broken down into sugars, are made up of carbon, hydrogen, and oxygen atoms, with the hydrogen and oxygen atoms in the ratio of 2 to 1, as in water. The notion arose, therefore, that these molecules consisted of carbon atoms to which water molecules had been added. For that reason they came

to be called carbohydrates (watered carbon). The true structure of carbohydrates, it eventually turned out, was much more complex than that.

Until Payen'’s discovery, carbohydrates had been given ordinary names such as cane sugar, grape sugar, starch, and so on. Now use of the -ose suffix, as in cellulose, spread until it was used for carbohydrates generally. Cane sugar became sucrose, grape sugar glucose, starch amylose, and so on—at least, to chemists.

1835,Dry Ice,"['Black', 'Dry', 'Thilorier', 'Earth']","['French', 'Solid']","As Black had shown seventy years earlier, energy is consumed in converting a liguid to a vapor (see 1762). This means that if a liquid is allowed to evaporate under conditions where no outside heat can enter the system, the energy for the vaporization must be ob-

tained from the liquid itself. As the liguid evaporates, its temperature therefore drops. (That is the purpose of perspiration. As it evaporates, the temperature of the skin drops and we remain comfortable on hot days. Increasing humidity, which reduces the rate of evaporation, makes us uncomfortable.)

The use of such evaporation to cool a liquid to the point of its solidification was demonstrated by the French chemist C.S.A. Thilorier in 1835. He began with the method introduced by Faraday to liguefy gases (see 1823) but made use of metal cylinders because they were stronger than glass and  could endure higher pressures.

He prepared liquid carbon dioxide in considerable quantity and then allowed it to escape from the tube through a narrow nozzle. As it escaped, it evaporated, and the temperature of the liquid in the cylinder dropped to the point where it froze. For the first time, solid carbon dioxide was formed.

Solid carbon dioxide, exposed to ordinary pressures, will slowly sublime— that is, evaporate directly to gas without melting. The sublimation point is —78.57C,

Solid carbon dioxide looks like ice, but since it doesn'’t form a liquid, it is popularly known as dry ice. Dry ice is obviously a more efficient cooling agent than ordinary ice would be. Thilorier added bits of dry ice to diethyl ether (the wellknown ether that was soon to be used as an anesthetic and that remains liquid to a very low temperature). By allowing the mixture to evaporate, he reached temperatures as low as —110° C. For the first time, a temperature was reached in the laboratory that was lower than any temperature ever recorded on Earth's surface, even in the depths of an Antarctic winter.

1835,Coriolis Effect,['Earth'],"['Redfield', 'French']","The existence of cyclonic storms, pointed out four years earlier by Redfield (see 1831) did not long remain a mystery

In 1835 a French physicist, Gaspard-Gustave de Coriolis (1792—1843), took up the matter of motion on a spinning surface, both mathematically and experimentally. When the Earth spins, it spins all in a piece, so that a point on the Equator, forced to move a length of 25,000 miles in twentyfour hours, must move a little over 1,000 miles an hour. As one progresses far-

ther and farther from the Equator, either north or south, a point on the surface makes smaller and smaller circles in the course of the day and

moves more and more slowly. At the poles, there is no motion.

If, then, we imagine a quantity of air or water near the Equator, we can see that it must be carried west to east at just over 1,000 miles per hour. If that air or water moves north (or south) away from the Equator, it retains its speed, but the solid ground beneath it moves more slowly. The air or water

|V

gains on the ground, therefore, and curves off eastward. Similarly, if air or water moves toward the Equator, it finds the ground moving faster and gaining on it, so in effect, it curves westward.

This curving motion is the Coriolis effect, and it accounts for the fact that air currents and water currents take up circular paths in opposite directions north and south of the Equator.

Earth is so large that under ordinary circumstances, we don't move north or south fast enough for the Coriolis effect to

come into significant play. It must be taken into account, however, in the case of artillery fire and satellite launchings.

Clearly this was a vulnerable time for the user, and the ability to fire more than once before reloading would provide an advantage against opponents not so equipped.

The first successful handgun of this sort held six bullets in a cylinder that automatically rotated with each shot, bringing another bullet into line for shooting. Known as a revolver, or a six-shooter, it was patented in 1835 by the American inventor Samuel Colt (1814-1862). The revolver became standard equipment in America’s pioneer society.

That this was not the case was shown by a German physiologist, Theodor Ambrose Hubert Schwann

(1810-1882). He had found in 1834 that when an extract of the stomach lining was mixed with acid, it had a far greater power to dissolve meat than when acid alone was used. By 1836 he  had extracted a substance from the stomach lining that proved particularly active in dissolving and digesting meat. He called it pepsin, from a Greek word meaning “to digest.”

Pepsin, like diastase (see 1833), was an enzyme, but diastase had come from the plant world. Pepsin was the first animal enzyme to be isolated.

In 1836 the British chemist John Frederic Daniell (1790—1845) produced a battery, the Daniell cell, that made use of copper and zinc electrodes, and that filled the bill. Even though the future on a large scale belonged to generators of the type that Far-

A Swiss naturalist, Louis Agassiz

In 1837 he began to move ahead of those who had gone before him to postulate that ice sheets had

covered far more than mountainous areas, having also spread over large sections of the lowlands in the northern portions of the continents. With time he found evidence of glaciation in Great Britain, and after he went to the United

States to lecture (and decided to remain there), he found evidence of glaciation in North America.

In the end he drew a convincing picture of an Ice Age, a period in the past when millions of square miles of North America, Scandinavia, and Siberia lay under a thick ice sheet. This was the first intimation that uniformitarianism (see 1830) was not one long, steady progression without surprises. The coming and going of the ice sheets had to be a kind of catastrophe, though clearly it had not put an end to life.

1838,Chlorophyll and Cells,"['Dutrochet', 'Pierre Wantsel']","['French', 'Greeks', 'Greeks Greeks', 'Gauss', 'Abel', 'French Greek', 'Greek']","When chlorophyll had been isolated (see 1817), its widespread existence in plants made it seem inevitable that it had some important function.

In 1837 the French chemist René-JoachimHenri Dutrochet (1776— 1847) was able to show definitely that photosynthesis (see 1779) took place only in those plant cells that contained chlorophyll. The key importance of chlorophyll to all multicellular

life, animals as well as plants, was thus definitely established.

Dutrochet was a convinced antivitalist, by the way. He believed that all aspects of nature, animate and inanimate, were subject to the same physical and chemical laws.

Trisecting an Angle

The Greeks had established the principle that geometrical constructions must be carried through with only a straightedge and a compass (so that you could only draw straight lines and circular arcs) and in a finite number of steps. There was no real reason for this except that it gave geometers the very minimum of tools to work with and made their tasks more “sporting.”

There were three constructions, however, the Greeks could never solve with straightedge and compass alone. The first was squaring the circle; that is, given a circle of any area, construct a square of the same area. The second was doubling the cube; that is, given a cube of any volume,

construct another cube of twice the volume. The third was trisecting the angle; that is, given an angle of any size, divide it into three equal angles.

Since the Greeks, other mathematicians had tackled those problems with equal lack of success. The work of Gauss (see 1796) and Abel (see 1824), however, had shown the value of proving impossibility in mathematics. In 1837 a French mathematician, Pierre Wantsel (1814— 1848), proved that doubling the cube and trisecting the angle were indeed impossible by the Greek rules. Eventually, squaring the circle was also shown to be impossible.

It is a queer commentary on human nature that these proofs of impossibility have not convinced any number of eager amateurs. A century and a half after these problems were shown to be impossible of solution by the Greek rules, hordes of circle-squarers and other impossibility-defiers still continue to offer the world their solutions, Needless to say, all such ""“solutions,” without exception, have— and indeed must have—a fallacy somewhere.

Bradley, when trying to detect stellar parallax, had discovered light aberration instead (see 1728). Herschel, in the same attempt, had discovered binary stars instead (see 1781).

The trouble was, the stellar parallax was so small that not till the 1830s did telescopes become sufficiently refined to detect it. At this time, the British astronomer Thomas Hender-

son (1798-1844) measured the parallax of Alpha Centauri from his observatory at Capetown in South Africa. (Alpha Centauri was so far south that it could not be observed from Europe.) The German astronomer Friedrich Georg Wilhelm von Struve (1793— 1864), while working in Russia, measured the parallax of Vega.

Alpha Centauri is the third-brightest star in the sky, and Vega the fourthbrightest, so there was a chance they were compara tively close. The German astronomer Friedrich Wilhelm Bessel (1784 1846) chose the star 61 Cygni, which was rather

dim but had the fastest proper motion (the apparent shift in position across the sky) then known, so that it was likely to be close, too.

Henderson was the first to complete the determination, but Bessel was the first to publish, in 1838, and it is he who gets the credit. His star, 61 Cygni turned out to be about 3 quadrillion miles away This distance is so mighty that even light takes 6 years to reach us from 61 Cygni—so that it is vears away. Alpha Centauri is only 4.3 lig and it is actually the sta

Since then, biologists had often seen cells in living tissue, seen them as small bodies marked off and enclosed by cell membranes in animals, and by thin, cellulose-containing cell walls in plants. Brown had even seen the nuclei within cells (see 1831).

In 1838 the German botanist Matthias Jakob Schleiden (1804—1881) made the necessary leap of understanding and announced that all living plant tissue was made up of cells. The next year, Schwann (see 1836) extended the notion to animals as well. Both Schleiden and Schwann felt that the cell nuclei were of importance in connection with cell reproduction but could not divine the details. Those details were not to be worked out for another forty years.

Some thought that yeast might not be alive either, but it was indisputable that yeast actually grew in quantity as it was used, and that was characteristic of life.

Finally, in 1838, a French engineer, Charles Cagniard de la Tour (1777— 1859), settled the matter. He studied yeast under the microscope and actually saw some of the globules budding and forming new globules. He realized he had been watching yeast cells, and that they were living things.

substances, which seemed to consist of molecules more complex than those of carbohydrates or fats. He came to believe that such substances were made up of a basic building block of carbon, hydrogen, oxygen, and nitrogen, to which were added varying numbers of sulfur and phosphorus atoms.

In 1838 he gave this basic building block the name protein, from the Greek word for “first,” since it seemed the foundation of substances that were of first importance to living tissue. Eventually the word came to be used for the substances generally, and to this day, protein is what we call one of the two types of substances that are indeed of first importance to living tissue.

It was just a matter of setting up a long wire and sending electricity through it in pulses by opening and closing a key. Combinations of pulses could be interpreted as letters and words.

What was needed was

not so much a scientist, however, as a promoter, who could raise the necessary money to set up a sufficiently long wire, with relays to keep the signal from fading with distance. One such promoter, who had been working on the

task since 1832, was the American artist Samuel Finley Breese Morse (1791— 1872).

In 1838 he produced a logical list of short and long electric impulses (dots and dashes) for the various letters of the alphabet. This

This is called photography, from Greek words meaning “light-writing.""”

The difficulty lay, first, in performing the feat after a reasonably short exposure and, second, in keeping the silver salts from

continuing to darken and erasing the photograph.

By 1839 Daguerre had learned to dissolve the unchanged silver salts with a solution of sodium thiosulfate, so that what was left was permanent. [t still required an exposure of at least twenty minutes, however, and the photographs that were obtained were faint.

Nevertheless, photography was born, and as others turned to it enthusiastically, the technique was very rapidly improved

This was the first astronomical photography. He was also the first to photograph the

solar spectrum. This heralded the day when astronomers could “freeze” a view and study it at leisure.

obtained from the sap of a tree originally native to tropical America but since grown in southeastern Asia and in other places as well. Rubber was recognized as a useful waterproofing material, since it was impervious to water and wasn't rotted by it either. The trouble was, though,

that when it grew cold, it stiffened and became brittle, and when it grew hot, it became soft and sticky. Attempts were made to find ways of making rubber less sensitive to temperature change, but at first there was only failure.

Then, in 1839, the American inventor Charles  Goodyear (1800-1860) had a stroke of luck. He was trying to add sulfur to rubber when some of the mixture came accidentally into contact with a hot stove. To Goodyear's astonishment, those portions that weren't scorched too badly became dry and flexible, and they didn’t lose flexibility in the cold or dryness in the heat. He began to heat the rubber-sulfur mixture to higher temperatures than anyone else had tried and thus obtained vulcanized rubber (after Vulcan, the Roman god of fire).

It was only with this discovery that rubber became truly useful, far more useful eventually than anyone might have suspected in Goodyear's day.

He began, in 1839, by studying a compound of cerium, an element that had already been isolated from a rare earth mineral. In the process, he found a new element, which he named lanthanum, from a Greek word meaning “hidden,” because

it had been hidden so effectively in those minerals.

In the next few years, he isolated four other elements from the rare earth minerals: yttrium, erbium, terbium, and didymium. The first three were named from syllables of Ytterby,

the quarry in Sweden where the first rare earth mineral had been obtained. The last was named from the Greek word for “twin,” because it seemed so similar in properties to lanthanum. In fact, all rare earth elements are remarkably similar to each other.

(1802-1850), took up the matter and measured the amount of heat developed by a wide variety of chemical reactions. In 1840 he announced what is now known as Hess's law, that the amount of heat developed (or absorbed) in going from substance A to substance B is always fixed, re-

gardless of the route by which the change is brought about.

The dependence on starting and ending points only, without concern for the path between, was already understood in connection with heat engines such as the steam engine. Hess's law made it seem  that the laws of thermodynamics, which had been developed from the study of heat engines, might hold for chemical reactions too. In short, the laws of thermodynamics might be universal.

Hess's law founded the science of thermochemi (the interrelationship of heat and chemical reactions).

decided the phenomenon was real.

A person could indeed be put into a trancelike state resembling sleep by having the conscious mind forced into a state of weariness through repetitive stimuli. During such a state of quasi-sleep, the patient was extraordinarily open to

In 1841, however, an English inventor, William Henry Fox Talbot (1800— 1877), patented a device in which a photographic negative could be formed on glass, with all the naturally light areas dark and vice versa. Light could then be passed through the negative onto sensitized paper and a negative of the negative could be made, with all the light areas light again and all the dark areas dark.

The advantage of this two-stage process was that, given a negative, any number of positive prints could be made. In 1844, in fact, the first book was published that was illustrated with photographs.

Since 1836, however, a German inventor, Johann Nikolaus von Dreyse (1787— 1867), had been working on a breech-loading rifle, in which bullets could be slipped in at the rear of the muzzle, making reloading much more rapid. It was perfected by 1841 and called the needle gun because it had a needlelike firing pin to detonate the powder and send the bullet flying. It was adopted by the Prussian army, which could then fire at a much greater rate than an opposing army equipped with only muzzle-loaders.

The British inventor Joseph Whitworth (1803—1887), for instance, had worked out techniques for producing devices that matched each other not merely to the nearest six-

teenth of an inch but to the nearest thousandth.

Even such improved methods wouldn’t help if different manufacturers produced items of different overall dimensions, however. For instance, one factory might produce screws, all alike, and so might another, but the pitch of the screws in the two [actories might be slightly different, so that one screw might fit a particular bolt and the other might not. In 1841 Whitworth suggested a standard pitch for all screws made everywhere, and the suggestion was eventually adopted.

When trade becomes first national, then international, and finally worldwide, such standardization becomes first advisable, then intensely useful, and finally indispensable.  1842

1841,Chemical Fertilizer,['John Bennet Lawes'],[],"Plants make use of minerals in the soil, and intensive cultivation deprives the soil of those minerals from year to year. If no minerals are returned to the soil, it will eventually lose fertility. The time-honored way of guarding against this is to make use of animal wastes as fertilizer, so that one of the important functions of domestic animals was to supply material for the manure pile, which would then have to be spread over the fields.

The manure piles, however, were not only offensively redolent, but could also be a source of dise (as was eventually discovered).

It occurred to chemists that it would be possible to determine just what elements were withdrawn from the soil and to return them in the form of odorfree, disease-free chemicals.

In 1842 an English agricultural scientist, John Bennet Lawes (1814—1900), patented a method for manufacturing what he called superphosphate and the next year set up a factory for its production. This was the first chemical fertilizer. Such fertilizers helped sweeten the atmosphere, reduce the disease rate, and increase the food supply. (Nowadays, there is a fashion for “organically grown™ food. Hiding behind that “organically” is the manure pile.)

1841,Doppler Effect,"['Christian Johann Doppler', 'Doppler']",['Austrian'],"The coming of the locomotive made a particular phenomenon much more noticeable than it had been earlier. The combination of speed and a warning whistle did the trick. People noticed that the whistle was high in pitch as the locomotive approached, and that the pitch dropped suddenly as the locomotive passed and began to recede.

An Austrian physicist, Christian Johann Doppler (1803-1853), explained the phenomenon correctly by pointing out that the sound waves partake of the motion of the source and so reach the ear at shorter intervals when the source is approaching—hence h pitch, When the sourc cedes, the waves reach the

ear at longer intervals— hence lower pitch.

Having done this in 1842, Doppler proceeded to check the matter experimentally a couple of years later. For two days, a locomotive pulled a flat car back and forth at different speeds. On the car were trumpeters sounding this note or that, while on the ground, musicians with a sense of absolute pitch recorded what they heard. Doppler verified his explanation in this way.

The Doppler effect turned out, in a few years,

to have enormous importance in connection with astronomy.

In 1842 the Swedish anatomist Anders Adolf Retzius (1796-1860) tried to make a finer division on the basis of something more subtle.

He suggested using the skull. The ratio of skull width to skull length,

multiplied by 100, he called the cranial index. A cranial index of less than 80 was dolichocephalic (Greek for “long head""), while one of over 80 was brachycephalic (wide head).

In this way, Europeans could be divided into Nordics (tall and dolichocephalic), Mediterraneans (short and dolichocephalic), and Alpines (short and brachycephalic).

Actually, this was not a very good system for dividing the human species into smaller groups. In fact, no really satisfactory system has been devised, and every attempt has simply encouraged racism and ethnocentricity. It is safer—and better—to stop at the fact that Homo sapiens is a single species.

1843,Mechanical Equivalent of Heat,"['Lavoisier', 'James Prescott Joule', 'Julius Robert', 'Joule']","['Newton', 'British', 'Joule', 'German']","Some conservation laws had already been accepted by this time. Lavoisier had advanced the law of conservation of mass (see 1789) and before that there had been the law of conservation of momentum (see 1668).

There were suspicions that energy ought to be conserved also. After all, motion was a common form of energy, and according to Newton, a moving body would move on forever if not affected by an outside force. The energy would not disappear.

In real life, though, a moving body does stop moving after a while because of

air resistance or because of friction with the ground. What happens to its energy then? Perhaps it is converted into heat. If so, however, a given amount of mechanical energy should be converted into some fixed amount of heat. Otherwise energy is hot conserved.

A British physicist, James Prescott Joule (1818—1889), undertook to check this by experimentation. He expended energy in a variety of ways and measured the amount of heat produced. All his experiments showed that a fixed quantity of work ended up in a fixed quantity of heat. In 1843 he published his results: that 41,800,000 ergs of work produce 1 calorie of heat. This is called the mechanical

equivalent of heat. Since 10,000,000 ergs are now called a joule in Joule's honor, we can say that 4.18 joules equal 1 calorie.

This made it appear that there might well be a law of conservation of energy if heat were included among the forms of energy. In fact a German physicist, Julius Robert von Mayer (1814-1878), had presented a figure of the mechanical equivalent of heat in 1842 (one that was far less accurate than Joule’s) and deduced from it that a law of conservation of energy existed, but his work did not attract attention

Then the Sun itself caught his attention, and for seventeen years he studied its orb on every day that it was visible.

In other words, more than one set of axioms could give rise to self-consistent and useful

consequences. This was so in geometry, and the Irish mathematician William Rowan Hamilton (1805— 1865) showed that it

was true in algebra as well.

Gauss had shown that complex numbers could be treated as though they were points on a plane, and that each could be represented by two numbers. Hamilton tried to deal with Aypercomplex numbers that could be presented as points in three or more dimensions. He tried to work out a system of dealing with such points and found he could not. Then, in 1843, the thought came to him that he could do so if he were willing to abandon the commutative law of multiplication,

It had always been taken as self-evident that A x B = B X A, but if this was abandoned, Hamilton found he could devise a self-consistent algebra of hypercomplex numbers, or as he called them, quaternions (from the Latin word for “four,” because each of Hamilton's points involved four numbers).

In order to keep the signal from fading over long lengths of wire, he made use of the electric relay invented by Henry (see 1823) in 1835. This is how it works. As electricity passes through a length of wire, the signal will eventually weaken but still be strong enough to produce an electromagnetic pull and attract a small iron key. This key, when attracted, can close a second circuit, which has a current from a nearby battery flowing through it. If that second circuit is long enough for its signal to weaken undesirably, a second relay can start a third circuit going. In other words, electric signals of sufficient strength to send a message can go any distance provided there are enough relays.

Morse patented his design in 1840.In 1843 he managed to persuade the United States Congress to appropriate money, and in 1844 he strung wires from Baltimore to Washington and sent the message, in Morse code, “What hath God wrought?"" (a quotation from the book of Numbers in the Bible).

The telegraph spread quickly, and pretty soon nations were held together by a webwork of wires that meant virtually instantaneous communication from border to border.

straight line (allowing for parallax and other effects not due to the stellar motion itself).

Bessel (see 1838) noted, however, that the stars Sirius and Procyon had a somewhat wavy motion after all else was allowed for. In 1844 he decided that this could only be caused by the gravitational pull of another star. He suggested, therefore, that Sirius and Procyon were each binary systems. Since the companion star could in neither case be seen, Bessel proposed that they were stars near the end of their lives, with their light fading toward extinction, and were now too dim to see, They were dark companions.

In a way, Bessel was right, but when the truth was worked out eighty years later, it turned out that the companions were stranger than Bessel could possibly have imagined.

It had a mirror that was 72 inches across. However, the telescope, though large, was clumsy. It couldn’t see much of the sky even when the sky was clear—and it was hardly ever clear.

Nevertheless, the telescope did accomplish a few things. In 1845 Rosse noted that one nebula had a distinct spiral shape, and in the following years he found fourteen others that were also spiral in appearance.

Attempts to control pain were many. The use of alcohol or some form of what came to be called hypnotism was old. Acupuncture was used in the Orient. The new chemistry also contributed nitrous oxide, which, when inhaled, served to suppress the sensation of pain.

As time went on, substances such as diethyl

ether (more commonly called simply ether) and chloroform were found to cause unconsciousness during which the sensation of pain disappeared. Ether came to be used by physicians during operations, the first to do so being an American physician, Crawford Williamson Long (1815-1878), who used it in 1842 to remove a tumor. He did not publish or publicize his work, however.

An American dentist, William Thomas Green Morton (1819-1868), used ether on a patient in September 1846, when extracting a tooth. The patient himself told the tale

to a newspaper, and Morton was urged to demonstrate the use of ether during an operation at Massachusetts General Hospital.

It was this demonstration that effectively introduced the practice into medicine, so that Morton usually gets credit for the discovery. The American physician Oliver Wendell Holmes (1809-1894) suggested the term anesthesia, from Greek words meaning “no sensation.”

1846,Neptune,"['Uranus', 'Alexis Bouvard', 'Uranus Uranus', 'John Couch Adams', 'Adams', 'Johann Gottfried Galle', 'Galle', 'Neptune', 'Galle Adams', 'Leverrier', 'William Lassell', 'Triton']","['Herschel', 'French', 'British', 'Uranus', 'Airy', 'French German', 'Roman', 'Newton', 'British Neptune', 'Neptune', 'Poseidon', 'Greek']","The planet Uranus, discovered by Herschel (see 1781), was naturally observed frequently and carefully by many astronomers. In 1821 the French astronomer Alexis Bouvard (1767— 1843) had shown that Uranus’s position in the sky had drifted somewhat from the position to be expected if the gravitational influence of the Sun and various planets were taken into account.

One possibility was that an as-yet-unknown planet existed beyond Uranus whose gravitational influence had not been taken into account.

A British astronomer, John Couch Adams (1819— 1892), attempted to calculate where such a distant planet might be in the sky based on the discrepancy in Uranus’s position. He made some reasonable assumptions as to its mass and its distance from the Sun, and by October 1843, he had a possible position located. Unfortunately, he could not interest the Astronomer Royal, Airy (see 1825), in his work.

Meanwhile, a French astronomer, Urbain-JeanJoseph Leverrier (1811— 1877), was attempting the same task independently, and he ended with a posi-

tion very similar to that of Adams. He wrote to a German astronomer, Johann Gottfried Galle (1812— 1910), and asked him if he would check that region of the sky,

As it happened, Galle had a new map of that portion of the sky, and when he started looking, on September 23, 1846, he found the planet almost at once, for it was fairly bright (as seen through the telescope). It was not on the map.

Because of its greenish color, the new planet was named Neptune after the Roman god of the sea. Although Galle actually saw the planet first, the credit for its discovery is divided between Adams and Leverrier. The whole story is usually regarded as the greatest victory that Newton's law of gravitation was to achieve, for a tiny apparent deviation from that law was enough to lead to the discovery of a giant planet.

Later in 1846, the British astronomer William Lassell (1799-1880) discovered a satellite of Neptune, which he named Triton after a son of Neptune (Poseidon) in the Greek myths. It was a large satellite, larger than our Moon, and was the last large satellite to be discovered.

1846,Vulcan,"['Neptune', 'Mercury', 'Mercury Vulcan']",['Roman'],"The planet Mercury has a moderately elliptical orbit. At the point in its orbit that marks its closest approach to the Sun, called its perihelion, Mercury moves forward very slowly because of the pull on it of other planets.

Leverrier (see Neptune, above) discovered in 1845 that, even when all planetary pulls were taken into account, Mercury's perihelion advanced just a bit more rapidly than it should.

He thought there might be a small planet closer to the Sun than Mercury was, whose gravitational pull was not being taken into account, He named it Vulcan after the Roman god of fire, and beginning in 1846, there were attempts to locate it.

All attempts to find Vulcan failed, however, and it was only seventy years later that a satisfactory explanation of the anomalous advance of Mercury’s orbit was put forward.

1846,Crystal Asymmetry,"['Louis Pasteur', 'Pasteur', 'Pasteur Crystal']","['Biot', 'French']","Biot had shown that some substances were capable of twisting the plane of polarized light (see 1815). He

had suggested at the time that some asymmetry in the system brought about the twisting. This seemed more likely to be true when it was found that some samples of a particular substance twisted polarized light clockwise, while other samples of the same substance twisted it counterclockwise.

Starting in 1846, a French chemist, Louis Pasteur (1822-1895), began his search for the possible asymmetries. He worked with small erystals of substances called rartrates, He studied them under the microscope and found that the crystals were rather subtly asymmetric, with one particular little facet on one side but not on the other. What's more, some crystals had the facet on the left side, while others had it on the right side, so that the two varieties were mirror images of each other.

These crystals had been obtained from a solution that had no effect on polarized light, and Pasteur suspected that one type of crystal produced one type of twist while the other produced the opposite type, the two together canceling each other. To check this, Pasteur separated the crystals painstakingly with tweezers, putting all the lefts to one side and all the

rights to another. He dissolved them separately, and sure enough, one solution twisted the polarized light clockwise and the other, counterclockwise.

Crystal asymmetry could be one reason for this optical activity, but it could not be the sole reason. After all, the solution twisted the plane of polarized light when the crystals were dissolved and gone. There had to be a more deep-seated asymmetry present, but it took another quarter-century before that was discovered.

1846,Protoplasm,"['Hugo', 'Mohl', 'Jan Evangelista Purkyiné']","['German', 'Czech', 'Greek']","A German botanist, Hugo von Mohl (1805-1872), studied plant cells assiduously. He found that the typical plant cell had a watery sap in the center, which showed no signs of life, and a granular colloidal layer rimming the cell, which did show such signs. In 1846 Mohl called this granular colloidal material protoplasmt.

The word had been used earlier in another connection. The Czech physiologist Jan Evangelista Purkyiné (1787-1869) had applied the word to the speck of living embryonic material in the egg, which was immersed in nonliving yolk that acted as its initial

food supply. Protoplasm is from Greek words meaning “first formed,""” and thus referred to the living part of the egg as the first-formed part of the organism. However, it was Mohl's more general use that caused the word to enter the scientific vocabulary.

Therefore it was to his advantage to make the people of his empire think he was a legitimate ruler, and the inscription describes his version of his accession to the throne at a conspicuous height so that as many people as possible could see it. (That was the nearest an ancient could get to a television speech in prime time.) To make sure that as many of his subjects as possible understood the message, he had it inscribed in Persian, Assyrian, and Elamitic.

In 1846 a British archaeologist, Henry Creswicke Rawlinson (1810— 1895), managed to work his way through the Persian bureaucracy and gain permis sion to investigate the inscription.

In 1847, however, the German physicist Hermann Ludwig Ferdinand von Helmholtz (1821-1894), whose credentials were impeccable, gathered the necessary data and published his conclusion that the law of conservation of energy existed. In other words, the total amount of energy in the Universe was constant; none could be created and none could be destroyed. Similarly, in any closed system—any portion of the

ad sugg

Universe from which energy could not leave and into which energy could not enter—the total amount of energy was conant and could be neither created nor destroyed. (To be sure, no subsection of the Universe can be perfectly isolated from all energy loss or gain.)

Naturally, although energy can be neither gained nor lost, it can be converted from one form to another. Electricity, magnetism, chemical energy, kinetic energy, light, sound, and heat can all be interconverted.

The law of conservation of energy is also known as the first law of thermodynamics and it is usually viewed as the most basic of all the laws of nature.

1847,Puerperal Fever,"['Ignaz Phillipp Semmelweiss', 'Semmelweiss', 'Hungary']","['Latin', 'United States', 'Holmes', 'Hungarian', 'Austria', 'Austrian']","It had long been understood that some diseases were contagious, although no one knew exactly what caused the contagion.

In the case of puerperal fever (from Latin words meaning “childbearing,” and more familiarly known as childbed fever), there were suspicious signs of a certain type of contagion. A woman giving birth who was treated by a doctor

who was also treating other

child-bearing women was much more likely to get the disease than a woman treated by a midwife who was not treating anyone else.

Some grew suspicious that doctors were somehow carrying the disease from patient to patient. The patients, being in a weakened

condition and often bleeding, were much more susceptible than the doctor, who generally escaped infection. In the United States, Holmes (see 1846) took this attitude and published his opinions, but was paid little heed.

In Vienna, a Hungarian physician, Ignaz Phillipp Semmelweiss (1818—1865), thought so, too, and when he gained control of a hospital in 1847, he began to force the doctors to wash their hands in a solution of calcium chloride before touching patients. This was unpleasant for the doctors, of course, especially those older ones who were proud of the “hospital odor” of their hands.

The incidence of puerperal fever went down drastically following Semmelweiss’s ruling, but this did not impress the rebellious doctors. When Hungary revolted against Austria in 1849, the Austrian doctors used Semmelweiss’s Hungarian origins as a way of forcing him out. The hand-washing stopped and the incidence of puerperal fever went up again at once—which didn't disturb the doctors.

It was not until the cause of infection was finally understood, some twenty years later, that doc-

tors began to reconcile themselves to washing their hands.

Disliking ether, however, he made use of chloroform (much more dangerous, actually). Beginning in 1847, he was the first to administer anesthesia to women in childbirth.

There were preachers who objected to this, since God had cursed Eve when she was cast out of Eden and told her that she would bear children in “pain and sorrow.” The preachers (who were all men) seemed to feel that pain and serrow were just what women needed. In 1853, however, Simpson used chloroform to help deliver Queen Victoria’s seventh child. The preachers, forced to choose between God and the queen, chose the queen, of course, and all eriticism ceased.

. . Nitroglycerine For five centuries, gunpowder had been the explosive par excellence, but now chemists were coming up with explosives that were much more powerful.

In 1845 a German chemist, Christian Friedrich Schonbein (1799— 1868), accidentally spilled a mixture of nitric and sulfuric acids on his kitchen table. He snatched up his wife’s apron to mop it up and then hung the wet apron over the stove to dry. It dried, and when it was dry enough, it went poof and disappeared. The astonished Schonbein experimented further and found he had discovered nitrocellulose, or as it came to be called, guncotton.

In 1847 an Italian chemist, Ascanio Sobrero (1812—-1888), using the same mixture of nitric and sulfuric acids, combined it with glycerine and produced nitroglycerine. When he heated a single drop in a test-tube, it exploded with such force that the horrified Sobrero did no further work on it.

Nitrocellulose and nitroglycerine were entirely too explosive to be worked with safely, but each was tamed and put to work, initiating the era of modern  explosives, both for good

tive purposes) and evil (in war and terrorism).

Even here, however, advances were finally being made.

The English mathematician George Boole (1815— 1864) tried to mathe-

maticize logical arguments.

Attempts had already been made in this direction, notably by Leibniz (see 1669). It was Boole, however, who carried it through successfully. He applied a set of symbols to logical operations, choosing both symbols and operations so that they would resemble those of algebra, and showed that by algebralike manipulations, the symbols could be made to yield logical results.

In 1847 he published The Mathematical Analysis of Logic, thus founding what might be called Bool-

ean algebra or symbolic logic. This was later to be of much use in studying the rigorous foundations of mathematics and, eventually, in programming computers.

1848,Absolute Zero,"['William Thomson', 'Baron Kelvin', 'Kelvin']","['Amagat', 'British', 'Celsius', 'Absolute', 'Kelvin']","The work of Amagat (see 1699), on the steady decrease in the volume of gases with temperature, gave rise to the suspicion that there might be a temperature—an absolute zero

—at which gas volume declined to zero. On the other hand, the volume decrease might lose validity once all gases were liquefied, and temperatures might thereafter be lowered indefinitely.

The British physicist

William Thomson, later

Baron Kelvin (1824-1907), pointed out in 1848 that it

was not volume loss that

was crucial, but energy i loss; that energy loss af- i fected all matter, liquids

and solids as well as gases; ‘ and that the rate of loss !

was such that absolute zero should be reached at —273° C.(The modern figure is —=273.15° C).

Kelvin proposed that a new absolute scale of temperature be created, based on absolute zero as the zero point. There would then be no negative temperatures. Each degree would be equal to a Celsius degree, so that the freezing point of water would be 273.15° A (for Absolute). Later scientists made it 273.15° K (where the K stands for Kelvin).

The concept of absolute temperature turned out to be essential to the science of thermodynamics.

It was a curiously irregular patch of fog that marked the spot at which a bright new star

had appeared in 1054, although that event had gone unnoticed in Europe.

To Rosse, the foggy patch seemed to have numerous crooked legs like those of a crab and he called it the Crab nebula in consequence, a name it has kept ever since. As time passed, the Crab nebula grew more and more interesting to astronomers until it was stated (with some exaggeration, perhaps) that all of astronomy could be divided into two equal parts: one, the Crab nebula, and two, everything else.

1849,Spectral Line Shift,['Doppler'],['French'],"Six years earlier, Doppler had explained the Doppler effect with respect to sound (see 1842). Now the French physicist Armand-Hippolyte-Louis Fizeau (1819— 1896) argued that the same effect would apply to any wave motion, particularly that of light.

If the light of the spectrum were unbroken, this would not be noticeable, since if the source were receding from us, ordinary visible light would move past the red boundary and become invisible, while invisible ultraviolet light would move past the violet boundary and become visible. It would work in the opposite direction if a light source were approaching us, and in neither case would there be any apparent change.

There are dark lines in the spectra, however, and these would shift their position. That would be noticeable. The lines would shift toward the red if the light source were receding and toward the violet if the light source were approaching. This is sometimes called the DopplerFizeau effect.

It was the red shift that proved of particular importance to astronomy.

1849,Speed of Light,"['Bradley', 'Light', 'Fizeau', 'Foucault', 'Light Foucault']","['Roemer', 'Fizeau', 'French']","Roemer and Bradley had both determined the speed of light by astronomical methods (see 1675 and 1728). But until 1849 no one had been able to determine the speed of light by setting up an earthbound experiment. In that year, Fizeau (see 1848) set up a rapidly turning toothed disk on one hilltop and a mirror on another, 5 miles away, Light passed through a gap between the teeth of the disk to the mirror and was reflected. By that time, a tooth had moved into the way and the reflection could not be seen. If the disk turned rapidly enough,

the reflected light passed through the next gap and could be seen again. From the speed of revolution required for the reflection to become visible, the time required for light to travel 10 miles could be calculated. Fizeau'’s assistant, the French physicist Jean-Bernard-Léon Foucault (1819~ 1868), improved the technique the next year. Instead of using a toothed wheel, Foucault used two mirrors, one of which was rotating rapidly. Light would be reflected from the stationary mirror to the rotating one. The rotating mirror would have turned slightly in the time it took light to travel to it and would reflect that

light slightly to one side as a result. From the amount of deflection, the speed of light could be calculated. Foucault's best figure for the speed of light was 185,000 miles per second. It was lower than the true value, but only by about 0.7 percent.

Foucault's method was so delicate that he only needed to let the light travel 66 feet. With only that distance to worry about, he could have it travel through water, and did. He found out that, through water, light traveled at only three-fourths its velocity through air. It turned out that the speed of light through any transpar ent medium is equal to the speed of light in a vacuum, divided by the index of refraction of the medium. (The index of refraction of a medium is a measure of the extent to which it will bend a light ray.)

Second law of Thermodynamics

The first law of thermodynamics (that is, the law of conservation of energy— see 1847) is an essentially optimistic law. Since no energy can be destroyed, it might seem that energy is always there to be used over and over.

Not all energy is equally useful, however. Carnot (see 1824) had pointed out that in a steam engine some of the energy must be lost as heat and so not all of it could be turned into useful work.

The German physicist Rudolf Julius Emanuel Clausius (1822-1888) found that this was true of any energy conversion: some energy was always lost as heat, and heat could never be converted completely to any other form of energy. As a result, the energy supply of the Universe was constantly being degraded to heat, and the amount of useful energy was constantly decreasing.

Clausius proposed that if the ratio of the heat content of a system to its absolute temperature were taken, that ratio would always increase in any process taking place in a closed system. Under perfect conditions, it might remain constant, but it would never decrease. Years later, Clausius gave this ratio the name of entropy for some rather obscure reason.

Clausius had thus established the second law of thermodynamics, that the amount of entropy in the Universe always increases and will some day reach a maximum when no useful energy is left and disorder is total. That sounds pessimistic, but since it will probably take many trillions of years to degrade all the energy in the Universe, it can’t be considered a matter of immediate concern.

spectrum it forms, and the spectral lines it contains,

can all be studied easily because light can be seen—it affects the retina. Infrared radiation cannot be seen and it is correspondingly harder to study.

An Italian physicist, Macedonio Melloni (1798— 1854), had invented a thermopile, however, a series of strips of two different metals that produced electric currents when one end was heated. Very weak electric currents could be detected and therefore so also could very weak heating effects.

In 1850 Melloni put his thermopile to work on the infrared radiation that Herschel had discovered (see 1800). He could detect the infrared radiation by its heating effects as delicately as the eye could detect ordinary light. Melloni was able to show that infrared radiation exhibited all the properties of ordinary light, including polarization and interference, so that there was no question it consisted of waves just like those of light but longer— too long to affect the retina.

The Late 19th Century (1851—-1894)

Two figures dominate latenineteenth-century science —Charles Darwin and Louis Pasteur. One explained how life on Earth had evolved, while the other changed humanity’s future with discoveries that led to the ability to control diseases. While other scientists had speculated on the possibility that contemporary life forms had evolved from earlier ones, Darwin was the first to lay out in detail the theory of evolution by natural selection. The book that brought his work to the world’s attention, The Origin of Species (1859), was the most important scientific work since Newton's Principia. Although at the time there was no fossil

data to provide details on the evolution of the human species, in 1871 Darwin published The Descent of Man, an application of his theories to the human race. In 1856 Louis Pasteur discovered that gentle heating kept wine from going sour and prevented the contamination of milk, and in the process he became interested in microorganisms. In 1860 he showed the role they played in the decay of meat. His great contribution came in 1862 when he published evidence for the germ theory of disease. This was the beginning of modern medicine, for now

specific and effective steps could be taken toward preventions and cures of dis-

eases. Perhaps the greatest contribution to chemistry during this period was made by Dmitry Ivanovich Mendeleyev, who in 1869 created a table of the elements arranged in order of increasing atomic weight. Electricity also featured strongly in late-nineteenthcentury technological innovations. Chief among those who put electricity to work for the masses was Thomas Alva Edison. In 1879, two years after devising the phonograph and after thousands of failed attempts, he

passed a current through a filament in a glass bulb and allowed humanity to push back the dark. A decade later and shortly aft ge Eastman had deve

oped the Kodak camera, Edison took a series of closely spaced photographs along a strip of film. When the developed film was moved in front of a light, the illusion of movement was created—and the motion picture was born. A year before Edison invented the phonograph, Alexander Graham Bell was searching for a way to transmit not just telegraph signals but the spoken

word. He found it in a mechanism that turned sound waves into fluctuating electric current that was reconverted into sound at the other end. Edison helped refine the telephone by increasing the amount of sound the microphone in the mouthpiece could carry. After earlier and less efficient engines by Jean Lenoir and Nikolaus August Otto, Carl Friedrich Benz built the first working

automobile with a gasolineburning internal-combustion engine in 1885. In 1853 George Cayley founded the science of aerodynamics when, in building a glider, he created a successful design by which a heavierthan-air object could be kept aloft. Although no engine of that time could propel such a vehicle, the shape he designed is the one that finally gave wings to human beings.

1851,Rotation of the Earth,[],"['Copernicus', 'Foucault', 'Paris']","Ever since the time of Copernicus (see 1543) it had been taken for granted that the Earth was rotating on its axis. Nevertheless, no one had actually dentonstrated the fact. It seemed stationary, and no effect had been observed (other than the apparent rotation of the sky) that could be attributed to the

rotation.

In 1851, however, Foucault (see 1849) suspended a large iron ball, about 2 feet in diameter and weighing 62 pounds, from a steel wire more than 200 feet long, hanging inside the dome of a large church.

The pendulum ended in a spike that just cleared the floor but would score a mark in the sand with which the floor was sprinkled.

The iron ball was drawn far to one side and tied to the wall by a cord. To prevent vibration when the ball was released, the cord was not cut, but set on fire. The swinging pendulum would then remain in the same plane, but the Earth, as it rotated, would change its orientation. If the pendulum had been at the North Pole, for example, the pendulum would have seemed to change its plane through a complete circle in 24 hours. At the latitude of Paris, the change would have taken 31

hours and 47 minutes. Thus the spectators were actually watching the Earth rotate under the pendulum.

In 1848 Lassell had discovered an eighth satellite of Saturn, which he named Hyperion after still another of Saturn’s (Cronos’s) brother-Titans in the ancient myths. This satellite was discovered almost simultaneously by the American astronomer  George Phillips Bond (1825-1865).

Then, in 1851, Lassell discovered a third and fourth satellite of Uranus.

He followed Herschel's precedent (see 1789) by naming them after spirits in English literature. One he named Ariel after a spirit

in Shakespeare’s The Tenipest and the other Unibriel after a spirit in Pope's The Rape of the Lock.

Joule-Thomson Effect

In 1852 Joule (see 1843) and Thomson (see 1848) were able to show that if a gas was allowed to expand, it consumed energy, because the molecules had to separate against a certain tendency to cling together. If energy were kept from entering the gas, the energy for expansion would have to come from the gas itself, and the temperature would drop.

This came to be called the Joule-Thomson effect and would later be used to liquefy some of the permanent gases (see 1845).

1852,Valence,['Edward Frankland'],['English'],"Chemists knew that elements had different capacities for combining with other elements. For instance, an oxygen atom would combine with two hydrogen atoms to form water, a nitrogen atom would combine with three hydrogen atoms to form ammonia, and a carbon atom would combine with four hydrogen atoms to form methane.

This was not studied closely and systematically, however, until an English chemist, Edward Frankland (1825-1899), studied organometallic compounds.

He could not help noticing the manner in which metallic atoms combined with organic compounds, and how each different kind of atom would almost invariably hook onto a fixed number of other atom groupings. In 1852 he published his theory of what came to be called valerce (from a Latin word for “power”’), pointing out that a particular atom had the power to combine with fixed numbers of other kinds of atoms according to simple rules.

It not only maintained its axial direction, but when it was tipped, the effect of gravity was to set up a motion at right angles that was equivalent to the precession of the equinoxes (see 134 B.C.).

This meant that a gyroscope, maintaining its axial orientation, could be used as a steady indicator of true north, substituting for, and better than, the magnetic compass that had been in use for some six centuries.

1853,Elevators,"['Elisha Graves Otis', 'Otis']",['American'],"As cities grow more crowded, they may spread out in area, or divide the available room into smaller and smaller living quarters, or build higher and higher structures

High structures were originally built of stone, as the strongest available material, but the higher the building, the thicker the stone had to be at the bottom to support the struc-

ture and the less room available for living quarters. Reinforced concrete (see 1849) made higher structures possible, and steel beams would in time be even better.

Yet with the best materials and the cleverest designs, a tall building is useless if there is no way but slow elimbing to lift oneself to the top floors.

In 1852 an American inventor, Elisha Graves Otis (1811-1861), built the first mechanical elevator with an adequate safety guard, one that would keep it from falling even if the cable holding it were severed completely. In 1854 Otis demonstrated the workability of the device by having himself raised to a considerable height and then having the cable cut. He descended safely.

It was the elevator more than anything else that made possible the shape of cities to come.

1853,Age of the Sun,"['God', 'Light', 'Helmbholtz', 'Helmholiz', 'Earth']",['Earth'],"It had been assumed for thousands of years that the Sun was eternal and changeless (and would be until God wished to put it to an end). The discovery of sunspots (see 1610) had shaken this belief but not destroyed it.

Once the law of conservation of energy was well established (see 1847), however, the shining of the Sun had to be questioned. Light and heat were energy, and this could not be created out of nothing. Where, then, did the Sun obtain the energy that had kept it shining brilliantly enough to warm the Earth at a distance of nearly a hundred million miles for all the many thousands of years of history? It could not be ordinary burning, for the entire substance of the Sun would have been consumed in a mere fifteen hundred years in that case.

Helmbholtz, who had been the one to establish the law of energy conservation, pondered the matter and by 1853 had decided that the only energy supply that would suffice was that

of the Sun's own gravitation.

Slowly, the Sun’s globe must be contracting, and the falling inward of that huge mass must be supplying the energy that was converted into light and heat. This must be the continuation of a process that had begun when a gigantic cloud of dust and gas had contracted to form the Sun in the first place (see 1796).

In order to supply light and heat at the current rate, Helmholiz concluded, the Sun must have contracted from a size filling the orbit of the Earth to its present size in something like twenty-five million years. That meant Earth could be no older than that. Moreover, it meant that in another ten million years, the Sun would be too small and cool to support life on Earth.

This conclusion came as a great shock to geologists, who already thought the Earth must be considerably older than twenty-five million years. It was to be another half-century before the controversy was settled —in favor of the geologists.

1854,Glider,"['Balloons', 'George Cayley', 'Cayley']",['English'],"Balloons had been in existence for seventy years, proving that objects that were themselves denser than air could remain aloft under proper conditions of winds and updrafts.

Nevertheless, the English engineer George Cayley (see 1809) was the first to study, scientifically, the conditions under which air might keep a heavierthan-air object aloft. He thus founded the science of aerodynamics. He realized that what was needed were fixed wings, like the flaps of a flying squirrel, rather than moving wings, like those of birds.

He worked out the basic shape that airplanes would eventually have— wings, tail, streamlined fuselage, and rudder. He also realized that he needed an engine and propeller to be able to proceed against the wind, but he knew that no engine then existing would be light and powerful enough to do so.

In 1853 he built the first device so constructed aerodynamically as to glide with the wind and lift with the updrafts—a glider, as it  TS

came to be called. Cayley, too old to take the risk, ordered his coachman to take the first glider flight. The coachman did so, vehemently objecting, flew 500 yards, and survived. Over the second half of the nineteenth century, glider-flying became a popular sport, as balloon-flying had been in the first half

When an epidemic of cholera struck London in 1854, Snow studied the geographic incidence of chol-

The process of laying such a cable required some understanding of what the floor of the Atlantic Ocean was like, and the task fell to the American oceanographer Matthew Fontaine Maury (1806—1873). In the early 1850s he had prepared a chart of ocean depths, and by 1854 he had noted that the Atlantic Ocean was shallower in the center than on either side. He concluded that there was a central plateau, which he called Telegraph Plateau.

Non-Euclidean Geometry

The non-Euclidean geometry worked out by Lobachevsky and Bolyai (see 1826) presupposed the possibility of more than one line through a point (even an infinite number of lines), all parallel to a given line that did not include the point. As in Euclidean geometry, lines of infinite length were possible.

In 1854 a German mathematician, Georg Friedrich Bernhard Riemann (1826-1866), developed another kind of nonEuclidean geometry, one in which it was impossible for

any two lines to be parallel, and all lines intersec What's more, in th try all lines were finite in length. In Euclidean geometry, the three angles of a trile add up to 360 degrees; in Lobachevskian

A much better vacuum had earlier been produced by Torricelli when he allowed a mercury column to drop downward out of its closed end (see 1643).

In 1855 the German inventor Johann Heinrich Wilhelm Geissler (1815— 1879) took advantage of Torricelli’s discovery to devise an air pump without moving mechanical parts. By moving a column of mercury up and down, he could make the vacuum above the column suck air out of a container. In this way, Geissler produced tubes that were more thoroughly evacuated than anything seen previously. Tubes so evacuated were called Geissler tubes, and their use was to lead in the decades that followed to remarkable advances in the study of atomic structure.

In 1855 an Italian physicist, Luigi Palmieri (1807— 1896), invented a device for the detection of such small tremors. This consisted of horizontal tubes, turned up at the ends and partly filled with mercury. Even slight quakes would cause the mercury to bob from side to side. Small iron floats were so attached that their movements could be read off on a scale and the intensity of the quake estimated.

This was the first crude seistmograph. It was not very useful; traffic vibrations, for instance, were difficult to distinguish from minor earthquakes; but it was a beginning.

Pyroxylin In 1855 a British chemist,

Alexander Parkes (1813— 1890), found that pyroxylin  (a partly nitrated cellulose), if dissolved in alcohol and ether in which camphor had also been dissolved,

1856,Glycogen,"['Claude Bernard', 'Bernard']","['French', 'Greek']","Until now, starch had been viewed as the plant’s way of storing energy. Animals tend to store it as fat (as some plants do too), which is a more compact form of energy.

In 1856, however, the French physiologist Claude Bernard (1813—1878) discovered a form of starch in the mammalian liver. Because it was easily broken down to glucose (the immediate energy source in the bloodstream), he called it glycogen (Greek for “glucose-producer”).

He showed that glycogen was built up out of blood glucose and acted as

a reserve store that could be broken down to glucose again when necessary Whether glycogen was built up or broken down depended on the exact state of the body, the energy requirements of the various tissues, the food supply in the intestines, and so on. The net result was that the glycogen balance was so maneuvered that the sugar content in the blood remained steady.

Until then, it was supposed that plants built up complex molecules (anabolisin) and that animals tore them down (catabolism). Bernard’s work showed that animals built up complex molecules as well, and

as time went on, it appeared that both plants and animals built up and broke down substances as needed. What was different between them was that the build-up in plants was through solar energy, while in animals, the build-up was through chemical energy from food, the food being obtained eventually, if not directly, from plants

1856,Steel,"['First', 'Henry Bessemer', 'Bessemer', 'Bessemer Steel']",['British'],"For over three thousand years, steel had been known to be the strongest metal, but

steel was a difficult process

wnulacturing

First, iron came out of the smelting furnace with a  great deal of carbon in it (from the charcoal or coke used to smeltit). This cast iron was hard but brittle. The carbon could be removed and pure iron (wrought iron) left behind. This was tough but too soft. Then finally, just the right amount of carbon could be added to form steel, which was both tough and hard. By then, steel was expensive.

The British metallurgist Henry Bessemer (1813— 1898) sought a way of removing the carbon from cast iron more cheaply. In the old way, the carbon was burned off by oxygen from additional iron ore while the mixture was strongly heated. Bessemer wondered if the oxygen could not be supplied more simply by sending a blast of air through the molten iron. It might seem that the blast would cool the iron and spoil everything, but the combination of oxygen from the air and carbon in the iron actually heated the mix. By stopping the process at the point where the carbon level was right, Bessemer got his steel directly.

In 1856 Bessemer announced his discovery, and such blast furnaces began to be built. It took a while for the method to be perfected because it required phosphorus-free iron ore,

something the steel manufacturers didn't understand. Eventually, however, the bugs were worked out and the era of cheap steel began. Steel, together with elevators (see 1852), helped build the cities of the next century.

There were also cochineal, from an insect, and indigo and alizarin from plants.

In 1856 a young British chemistry student, William Henry Perkin (1838-1907), was trying to synthesize quinine, the antimalarial drug. He was doomed to failure, for the molecular structure of quinine was far too complex for the synthetic methods of the time to handle.

In the mess that resulted, however, Perkin

thought he saw a purplish glint. He added alcohol, which dissolved a substance that turned the solution a beautiful mauve (as the color was eventually named). Perkin wondered if it could be used as a dye. He had it checked and decided it could. He left school, invested the family savings in a factory to manufacture the dye, and the project proved most successful.

Other chemists quickly entered the field of synthetic dyes and the world of fashion became the rainbow of colors it has been ever since.

This was not unusual, and what was commonly done in such cases was to throw away the bones. This time, though, the word reached a professor at a nearby school, and he managed to salvage about fourteen of the bones, including a skull.

By this time, geologists were sure the Earth was very old, and biologists  were sure that human beings had been alive for much longer than the Bible seemed to indicate. But however long human beings had been alive, had they always been human beings, or had they evolved from some simpler form?

The bones from the Neanderthal cave were clearly human, but the skull was rather different from those of modern humans. It had pronounced bony ridges over the eyes, a backwardsloping forehead, a receding chin, and unusually prominent teeth.

The remains were quickly dubbed Neanderthal man and the question arose as to whether it was a primitive form of human being or merely an individual with some bone disorder. The chief supporter of the view that it was a primitive form of humanity was a French anthropologist, Pierre-Paul Broca (1824—

1880), and he won out eventually.

Nowadays, we believe Neanderthal man to be a subspecies of Homo sapiens. Nevertheless, the 1856 finding was the first step toward the demonstration, through fossil remains, of the evolution of the human species.

Pasteur (see 1846) undertook the task of investigating the problem. He studied samples of wine under the microscope and found that, when wine aged properly, it contained yeast cells that were spherical globules. Wine that was souring contained elongated yeast cells. He decided there were two types

of yeast cells, one of which created lactic acid

He also decided that the only solution to the problem was to kill the

yeast cells, good and bad

alike, after the alcohol had formed but before the acid had a chance to form. The wine should be heated gently at about 50° C and then stoppered and left to age without the influence of yeast.

The vintners were horrified at the suggestion, but they were desperate enough to try it, and they found that it worked. The process of gentle heating was called pasteurization, and it was eventually applied to milk, too, to prevent diseases that might otherwise be spread by its contamination.

This episode turned Pasteur’s attention to the world of microorganisms, with enormously important results.

Since

they were inside Roche's limit (see 1849), solid particles would break up under tidal influences and be unable to coalesce again. In 1857 Maxwell (see 1855)

showed that this was indeed so, based on purely theoretical considerations, and no one has doubted it since.

Evolution by Natural Selection

The British biologist Charles Robert Darwin (1809-1882), like many biologists, believed that life forms had evolved; that some species, with time, changed into other related species, while some species became extinct. What puzzled Darwin was the mechanism that drove evolution onward.

In 1838 he read Mal-

thus (see 1798) and realized that not only human beings multiplied past the food supply available, but that all living things did. Therefore, in each generation, there was a competition for survival among the toomany, and those tended to survive who could snatch enough food, or best evade a predator. In short, nature itself would select a few from the many for survival. The characteristics that made survival likely would be inherited by the offspring of the survivers and

again there would be a natural selection. Darwin assumed that there were always variations among offspring, random and tiny variations perhaps, and that nature then used those variations as a means of selection, so to speak. The “better” among the variations would not always do better, since there was always the factor of chance, but on the whole, and in the long run, they would. Darwin was theorizing, then, on evolution by natural selection. Knowing that

this idea would create enormous controversy, and being a gentle person who could not bear to participate in such controversy, he spent some twenty years gathering evidence for his point of view, hoping that when he did publish, the evidence would be so overwhelming that it would preclude argument. (In this he was naive, for he did not count on the strength with which human beings can turn away from facts and cling to superstition.)

In 1858 another British biologist, Alfred Russel Wallace (1823-1913), was in the East Indies. He too had read Malthus and arrived at the notion of evolution by natural selection. Unhampered by Darwin’s fear of controversy, Wallace wrote up his theories in three days. Then, in order that his views might be checked by an approriate expert, he sent his elevenpage paper to Darwin, who could scarcely believe his eyes when he saw himself so anticipated.

There was nothing for Darwin to do but to suggest a joint publication and this was carried through immediately. In the next year, 1859, Darwin reluctantly published a book, best known as The Origin of Species, in which he presented his theory in detail (but not in as much detail as he

would have liked, for he had been planning a book five times as long at least).

Darwin’s book was the most notable scientific work since Newton's great classic (see 1687). It was the foundation of a new biology, as Newton's had been the foundation of a new physics. It changed the very current of people’s thinking, and the world has never been the same.

1858,Organic Molecular Structure,"['Friedrich August Kekule', 'Archibald Scott Couper', 'Water', 'Kekule']","['Frankland', 'German', 'British']","Up to this point, organic molecules were still characterized by the number of atoms of each element that were present. Even when it was understood that in isomers the same number of the same sorts of atoms must be arranged differently, it was not clear what the difference in arrangement might be.

However, Frankland’s notion of valence (see 1852) offered an important handle, which the German chemist Friedrich August Kekule von Stradonitz (1829—1896) made use of. He pointed out that since hydrogen had a valence of 1, oxygen of 2, nitrogen of 3, and carbon of 4, this meant that each hydrogen atom could be attached to other atoms by means of a

single ""hook,"" each oxygen by means of two ""“hooks,” each nitrogen by means of three, and each carbon by means of four.

A British chemist, Archibald Scott Couper (1831-1892), working independently, suggested that each atom have its valence indicated by dashes. Thus, the hydrogen molecule, the oxygen molecule, and the nitrogen molecule would be written H—H, 0=0, and N=N. Water would be H—O—H, carbon dioxide would be 0=C=0, and so on.

Kekule's second great point was that carbon atoms could hook onto each other freely, so that molecules might be made up of chains of carbon atoms, with other atoms latching onto the valence bonds not taken up by the formation of those chains.

This system finally made sense of many oiganic molecules. The different arrangements of isomers could often be worked out, and a great deal of the mystery of organic chemistry vanished.

There he showed that abnormal cells that marked one disease or another arose from normal cells. There was no sudden change, but a smooth development of abnormality. This served to found the science of cellular pathology.

Virchow went on to oppose the idea of spontaneous generation. He pointed out that “all cells come from cells,” and since the cell is already a complex organization of simpler parts, it is unlikely that it can originate easily from dead matter.

1859,Refrigerators,"['Ferdinand Carré', 'George Gabriel Stokes', 'Julius Pliicker']","['French', 'British', 'German', 'Geissler']","Reducing food to a low temperature kept it from spoiling, and in early times, natural ice was used for the purpose. Even in summer, snow or ice could be brought from nearby mountainous areas. And ice gathered from ponds in the winter could be insulated with straw and kept in underground icehouses through the summer,

In the early nineteenth century, a number of people tried to design mechanical refrigerators. The efforts of scientists to liguefy gases had made it

clear that, if a gas were liguefied and then allowed to evaporate, it would lower its own temperature and therefore its surroundings. If the vapor were then condensed by pressure and allowed to evaporate again, over and over, heat would, in effect, be pumped out of the refrigerator into the surrounding air.

The first such device that we would recognize as similar in essence to those we have today, and that was a reasonable commercial success, was designed by a French inventor, Ferdinand Carré (1824-1900). His first device, built in 1858, used water, but in 1859 he switched to ammonia, which was much more efficient.

Of course, the early refrigerators were bulky and inconvenient, and ammonia was a corrosive and poisonous substance. They were used only industrially, for ice-making or in meatpacking plants, for instance, to preserve the meat. It took some threequarters of a century of improvement before refrigerators became convenient and almost universal household appliances.

Electricity in a Vacuum

Occasionally, scientists would try to force an electric current through a vacuum, hoping, perhaps, that they would be able to study the electric fluid itself, which would be forced out into the open if there were no matter obscuring it. Faraday (see 1821) had tried it, for instance, and noticed that the glass vessel enclosing the vacuum showed a greenish glow. This glow was given the name of fluorescence in 1852 by the British physicist George Gabriel Stokes (1819-1903) (a term now applied to any visible light that arises from the energetic collision of radiation with

matter).

However, the vessels were never sufficiently evacuated to make possible the study of the electric fluid itself, at least not until the Geissler tube (see 1855) was devised.

In 1858 the German physicist Julius Pliicker (1801-1868) forced an electric current through a Geissler tube. He detected the fluorescence, described it, and noted that the pesition of the fluorescence shifted in response to an electromagnetic field. Whatever was happening in the tube,  an electric charge was involved. This was the first tentative advance toward

understanding that atoms were more than tiny little

balls.

In the Middle East, where petroleum is particularly common, some was found even on the surface. There the smaller molecules evaporated, leaving behind a tarry substance variously called pitch, bitumen, and asphalt. This was used in waterproofing.

From pitch one could also sometimes extract an inflammable liquid called naphtha (from a Persian word meaning “liquid”), which could be used in lamps.

There was a limit to what could be obtained on the surface, however. It was also possible to dig for it. Two thousand years before, the Chinese had dug for brine and occasionally obtained oil.

An American railway conductor, Edwin Laurentine Drake (1819-1880), had invested in a firm that thered oil for medicinal

purposes, from seepages near Titusville, Pennsylvania. It occurred to Drake, who knew about the brinedrilling, that oil could be drilled for as brine was. He studied drilling methods and, in 1859, set about using those methods at Titusville. He drilled 69 feet into the ground and, on August 28, struck oil. He had drilled the first oil well, which was soon producing 400 gallons per day Other drillings followed, and other oil wells

The first consequence of this was that kerosene could be obtained in great

quantities from petroleum, and the kerosene lamp became almost universal in the United States and elsewhere. Kerosene served to replace whale oil and to cut down somewhat on the carnage that humanity was visiting on those inoffensive animals.

Much more than that, however, lay in the future.

1859,Storage Battery,"['Volta', 'Gaston Planté']",['French'],"All the electric batteries used in the six decades since Volta had invented the first one (see 1800) were one-shot affairs. The chemical reaction that gave rise to the electric current eventually proceeded to a point where it could no longer support current. It then had to be discarded, for the chemical reaction could not be reversed.

Yet some chemical reactions are easily reversible. In 1859 a French physicist, Gaston Planté (1834—1889), took two sheets of lead, with an insulating sheet of rubber between them, rolled the lead sheets into a spiral, and upended it into dilute sulfuric acid. He found that a chemical reaction resulted that would produce an electric current. Furthermore, when the battery was discharged, an electric current could be forced through it

in the opposite direction, and the chemical reaction would be reversed, so that the battery could eventually produce an electric current again.

Naturally, we are not getting something for nothing. The second law of thermodynamics (see 1850) would not allow that. The electrical energy required to charge a storage battery is always greater than the amount it can then deliver. It would be a lasing proposition, therefore, to charge a discharged storage battery from one that was fully charged. To charge a storage battery, you must get your electricity from a generator that makes use of fuel energy or some other nonelectrical source of energy.

The German physicist Gustav Robert Kirchhoff (1824-1887), however, had carefully studied the spectra of light produced when various elements were heated to incandescence. He found that each element produced light of only cer-

tain wavelengths, so that the spectrum consisted sometimes of only a few lines of light, which were sometimes well separated.

In 1859 Kirchhoff announced that every element produced characteristic spectral lines, which it also absorbed when its vapors were cooler than the light source. The pattern of lines was different for each element; no two elements shared spectral lines in exactly the same pasitions. In essence, each element had a spectral “fingerprint.”

This meant that if any sample of ore, on being heated to incandescence, produced even a single spectral line in a position not recorded for any known element, then some new element must be present in that ore.

Making use of such spectroscopic data, Kirchhoff discovered cesium in 1860. The name is derived from the Latin word for ""sky-blue,” since that was the color of the spectral line that had given away cesium'’s existence, The next year Kirchhoff discovered rubidium, a related element, its name coming from the Latin for “red.”

Kirchhoff also pointed out that the dark lines in the solar spectrum were the result of light being absorbed by the gases in the

relatively cool atmosphere of the Sun. From those lines, one could be sure that sodium existed in the Sun’s atmosphere, and half a dozen other elements as well.

This was the first actual observation indicating that the same chemical elements that existed on Earth existed also on other astronomical bodies, and therefore presumably throughout the Universe.

1859,Solar Flares,"['Richard Christopher Carrington', 'Galileo', 'Carrington', 'Carrington Carrington']",['British'],"The British astronomer Richard Christopher Carrington (1826—1875) measured the Sun's rotation by the motion of the sunspots. Galileo had done that two and a half centuries before, but Carrington could work with more delicate instruments. He found that the Sun did not rotate all in a piece, which meant that it was not a solid body, but that the outer regions, at least, might well be gaseous. (In view of the temperature of the Sun's surface, this was not surprising.) A point on the solar equator took 25 days to make one turn around the Sun, while at solar latitude 45 degrees, a point that had to travel a considerably smaller distance to make the turn, it took 27'% days.

On September 1, 1859,

Carrington, watching the sunspots, observed a starlike point of light burst out of the Sun's surface. It lasted 5 minutes and subsided. Carrington speculated that a large meteor had fallen into the Sun, but it was eventually realized that he had been the first to see a solar flare, a brief but violent explosion that was usually associated with sunspots. This was the beginning of an understanding that when the number of sunspots was high, we had an “active Sun” and when it was low, a “quiet Sun.”

1860,Kinetic Theory of Gases,"['Saturn', 'Maxwell', 'Boyle', 'Charles']","['Maxwell', 'Greek']","Maxwell, having worked on the small particles that made up Saturn's rings (see 1857), turned in 1859 to other, even smaller particles—the molecules that made up gases. Maxwell treated the situation statistically, assuming that the molecules moved in random directions at random speeds and bounced off the walls of a container, and off each other, with perfect elasticity.

Eventually he worked out mathematical relationships that showed the distribution of velocities among the molecules of a gas at a particular tempera-

ture. A few molecules moved very slowly and a few very quickly, but larger percentages moved at intermediate velocities, with the most common velocity somewhere in the middle. A rise in temperature caused the average velocity to rise, while a drop in temperature caused it to fall. In fact temperature—and heat itself—could be pictured as molecular movement and nothing else. This is called the kinetic theory of gases, where kinetic is from the Greek word for “motion.”

From the random motion of the molecules, the various laws involving gases could be deduced (Boyle's law—see 1662; Charles's law—see 1787), but they were obeyed statistically. That is, gases might act quite differently from the way they do by chance deviation from the normal. However, there are so many molecules that statistical deviations involving more than a vanishingly small percentage of them are enormously improbable.

In the same way, as Maxwell pointed out, gases can defy the second law of thermodynamics if all the molecules happen to move in the same direction, or all the faster molecules gain still more speed from the slower ones—but the  chance of that happening is so small that in the entire lifetime of the Universe, it

is not likely to have hap-

pened in any cubic centime-

ter of it.

1860,Spontaneous Generation,"['Pasteur', 'Pasteur Darwin', 'Darwin']","['Pasteur', 'God']","Pasteur (see 1846) now took up the matter of spontaneous generation. It was already clear that nutrient broth that had been strongly heated till all microorganisms within it were dead would not develop microorganisms if it were sealed away from air. Vitalists, however, maintained that the heating destroyed some vital principle in the air.

Pasteur had shown that

dust in the air carried microorganisms. In 1860, he therefore boiled meat extract and then left it in a flask exposed to air, but only by way of a long narrow neck that was bent down, then up. Although unheated air could thus freely penetrate into the flask, dust particles settled to the bottom of the curved neck and did not enter the flask. The meat extract did not spoil. No decay took place. No organisms developed. There was no question now of a destroyed vital principle. When

Pasteur knocked the neck off the flask, microorganisms developed in the meat extract at once.

That was the final destruction of the notion of spontaneous generation— at least under present conditions.

Darwin’s theory of evolution, however, had opened the question as regards the past. If species had evolved, might there not have been a time when life itself evolved from nonliving precursors? This was a most uneasy thought to those who had always as

sumed life to be a creation of God, but Darwin himself had raised the possibility— and that possibility has concerned science ever since.

1860,Organic Synthesis,"['Waéhler', 'Steam', 'Lenoir']","['French', 'Kekule', 'Greek']","When Waéhler had synthesized urea (see 1828), it might very well have been considered an anomaly, but the techniques of organic chemistry were advancing, and other organic molecules were being synthesized from the elements.

In particular, PierreEugeéne-Marcelin Berthelot (1827—-1907), a French chemist, went about such syntheses and, by 1860, had synthesized such wellknown and important organic molecules as methyl alcohol, ethyl alcohol, methane, benzene, and acetylene. He even synthesized molecules that fulfilled all the requirements of organic molecules in terms of structure and properties but that did not oceur in living tissue, which put an end once and for all to the idea that only living tissue could manufacture organic molecules.

Indeed, in 1861, when Kekule (see 1858) published a textbook of organic chemistry, he defined it as the chemistry of carbon com-

pounds, with no mention of life. After that, when a term was needed for the chemistry of compounds that occur in living tissue specifically, the term chosen was biochemistry (with biofrom the Greek word for “life”).

InternalCombustion Engine

For a century and a half, steam engines had produced heat outside the system they were powering. Steam formed by the heat entered a cylinder and moved a piston.

What if a mixture of inflammable vapor with air could be exploded within a cylinder? The force of this internal explosion would then move the piston directly. (The fuel would have to be a gas to begin with, or an easily evaporated liguid.)

If such an internalcombustion engine were developed, it would be much smaller than a steam engine and so much more readily set into motion. After all, a vapor-air mixture will explode at the touch of a spark, while the initial boiling of water over a fire, in the case of the external-combustion steam engine, is a slow process.

A working internalcombustion engine was first constructed by a Belgian-born, French inventor, Jean-Joseph-Etienne Lenoir (1822—-1900). In 1860 he hitched such an engine to a small conveyance and had a “horseless carriage.” Horseless carriages run by steam had existed previously, but Lenoir’s was more compact and more responsive to controls.

Nevertheless, Lenoir's internal-combustion engine was very inefficient. It was not till the next decade that an engine of this sort was built that was efficient enough for widespread use.

1860,Solar Prominences,['Warren De'],"['Photography', 'English', 'Spain']","Photography of astronomical phenomena was becoming more common. In 1858 the English astronomer Warren De la Rue (1815— 1889) had devised a telescope that was particularly adapted to taking photographs of the Sun. After that, solar photography became an almost daily routine for him.

In 1860 he traveled to Spain to observe a total eclipse of the Sun. The photograph he took of the Sun during the eclipse showed gouts of flame about its  edge. These were called solar prominences and, like solar flares (see 1859), were evidence of violent activity on the Sun. This was the first astronomical discovery to be made as the result of photography.

For that reason, Kekule called for an international conference of chemists to consider the matter. In 1860 the conference took place in Karlsruhe, just across the Rhine from France. (It was the first in-

ternational scientific conference.)

Attending was an Italian chemist, Stanislao Cannizzaro (1826—1910), who, two years before, had come across Avogadro’s hypothesis (see 1811), now half a century old. Cannizzaro saw that from Avogadro’s hypothesis the molecular weight of various gases could be determined with certainty and that this would reduce much of the confusion that attended molecular structure.

He made a strong speech, introducing the hypothesis and explaining how to use it. He carried conviction to some immediately, and to others afterward. Avogadro’s hypothesis was accepted at last, and general agreement over molecular structure followed.

1861,Black Bodies,[],['Kirchhoff'],"Kirchhoff, having pointed out that materials emitting certain wavelengths when hot will absorb the same wavelengths when cool (see 1859), drew a natural conclusion.

He suggested in 1860 that a body that absorbed all light and reflected none (and was a black body as a result) would, when heated, emit all wavelengths of light.

This may not have seemed very important at the time, but the question of how the wavelengths were given off, how they were distributed across the total spectrum, and how this changed with temperature turned out to be a | major puzzle. Within four decades, it had led to a revolution in physics.

1861,Archeopteryx,[],['Greek'],"Although the giant dinosaurs, whose fossil relics had been dug up over the past forty years, were the most dramatic remnants of ancient life, the most important single fossil was not a giant, but a relatively small lizardlike animal that was discovered in

1861. It is estimated now to be about 140 million years old.

1t left a clear impression in a rock, which showed that it had a head possessing teeth and no beak, a long neck, a long tail, and a flat breastbone— all very lizardlike. There was, however, one allimportant added feature. The “lizard” had feathers. The imprints of those feathers are unmistakable. They are in a double row down the length of the tail and are also present along the forelimbs.

In the world today, every known bird has feathers, and no living thing that is not a bird has them. Therefore, it is necessary to think of this fossil as repre-

senting a very primitive bird. It is called archeopteryx (from Greek words meaning “‘ancient wing’’).

The archeopteryx is the best-known example of an ancient life form that seems to lie exactly between two major groups of today’s life forms. It is half reptile and half bird and is therefore a perfect example of a reptile in the process of becoming a bird. No other fossil discovered before or since is such a clear example of evolution at work.

1861,Broca’s Convolution,"['Gall', 'Gall Broca', 'Broca']",['Broca'],"Gall had been of the opinion that different parts of the brain controlled different parts and functions of the body (see 1810). Gall's conclusions were strictly speculative, however. The first person to present conclusive evidence of a specific region of the brain in charge of a specific function was Broca (see 1856). Broca had a fifty-oneyear-old patient who had lost the ability to speak.

When the patient died in 1861, a postmortem revealed damage to the third convolution on the left frontal lobe of the cerebrum (now known as Broca's convolution). Gall’s insight, which had been misdirected into phrenology, was thus put right.

In 1862 Pasteur (see 1846) took up the matter and issued a publication that gathered all the evidence. His prestige was such that the germ theory of disease then had to be taken seriously. There is no question but that this was the most important single ad-

vance in the history of medicine.

Using the theory, Pasteur, and others as well, located the specific microorganisms that caused certain diseases and could then work out logical ways of preventing the disease in the first place or of curing it once it struck.

This was the beginning of modern medicine. It led to a fall in the death rate, a doubling in life expectancy, and an accelerated population explosion that has more than tripled world population since Pasteur’s

time and presented humanity with enormous problems in consequence.

Dim .

Companion of Sirius Bessel had suggested the existence of a dark companion of Sirius, one that could not be seen but that betrayed its existence by its gravitational influence (see 1844).

On January 31, 1862,

an American astronomer, Alvan Graham Clark (1832—

1897), had ground a new 18-inch lens and was testing it in a telescope by examining Sirius. He saw a tiny spot of light near Sirius and thought at first that it might represent an imperfection in the lens. Since other bright stars did not show such an effect, however, he concluded that he was actually seeing the companion of Sirius. It was not truly dark, merely dim. Clark did not know that he was looking at anything more than a dim star. It was to be six decades before the true and most unusual nature of the companion of Sirius was to be demonstrated.

These bodies were eventually named chloroplasts. Furthermore, starch grains appeared within the chloroplasts, and Sachs was thus able to show that starch was the product of photosynthesis.

In 1857 two British explorers, Richard Francis Burton (1821~1890) and John Hanning Speke

(1827-1864), started from Zanzibar in east central Africa and probed westward in search of the great lakes that Arab traders had reported. In February 1858 they reached Lake Tanganyika, a long, narrow body of water 620 miles from the African coast.

There, Burton had had enough and left. Speke, however, moved northward on his own and, on July 30, reached Lake Victoria, in area the second-largest body of fresh water in the world. (Only Lake Superior is larger.)

In 1862 Speke confirmed that a stream issuing from the northern rim of Lake Victoria was the Nile River. It was necessary, then, to trace back the longest river that flowed into Lake Victoria. That turned out to be the Luvironza, which is 715 miles long and flows into the lake from the west. The source of the Luvironza is therefore the true source of the Nile, and it is located in the modern nation of Burundi about 35 miles east of Lake Tanganyika.

1861,Ironclad Warships,"['Union', 'John Ericsson']","['Norfolk', 'Virginia', 'Virginia British', 'American', 'Swedish', 'British']","In 1862 the American Confederacy raised a scuttled Union ship, the Merrimack,  from its resting place near Norfolk, Virginia, renamed the ship Virginia, covered her with iron plates, placed a cast-iron ram under the waterline, and outfitted her with ten guns.

On March 8, the ironclad Merrimack attacked the wooden Union ships that were blockading the port and sank them. She was absolutely untouchable by the Union guns. For a while it seemed as though the Merrimack could singlehandedly take on and destroy the entire Union navy and break the blockade. The Confederacy could then, with British help, win its independence.

However, an American engineer of Swedish birth, John Ericsson (1803—1889), had already built an ironclad vessel, the Monitor, for the Union, It was small, floated very low in the water, and had two guns, It sailed south just as the Merrimack was launching its attack. On March 9, only one day after the Merrimack's, triumph, the Monitor arrived, and there was a 5-

hour fight in which neither ship could damage the other. However, the Merrimack sprang a leak, moved into dry dock, and never left again, so the Union was saved.

It was clear to the whole world, however, that wooden warships were now obsolete, and every navy (including especially the British) began the process of converting itself into an ironclad force.

By November 1862 he had developed a rapid-fire

gun that could shoot nearly six bullets per second, though it had to be handcranked.

This means that the presence of even a small amount of carbon dioxide and water vapor in the air will keep the Earth's surface temperature higher than it would otherwise be This resembles the situation in a greenhouse, where light enters through the glass and warms the atmosphere within, but heat escapes only with difficulty, so that the net effect is to warm the greenhouse.

Chemists were uneasy with that, so they tried to group elements into families. Several attempts had already been made, but an English chemist, John Alexander Reina Newlands (1837-1898), tried something a bit different.

He listed the elements in order of atomic weight and found that the second seven repeated the properties of the first seven quite closely. He tried to extend this further, referring to it as the law of octaves (as in music, where the same seven notes are repeated over and over, with every eighth note resembling the first octave higher, octave coming from the Latin word for “eight"").

Newlands’s work was not taken seriously, because the list of elements fit the law of octaves very imperfectly. Nevertheless, it

helped put the listing of elements in vogue, and in the course of the following decade a much superior table was established.

1865,Genetics,"['Gregor Johann Mendel', 'Carefully', 'Mendel', 'Mendel Mendel', 'Next Mendel', 'Dwarfness', 'Mendel Mendel Mendel', 'Mendel Mendel Darwin']","['Darwin', 'Austrian', 'Augustinian', 'Mendelian', 'Greek', 'Mendelian Darwin']","There was a flaw in Darwin's theory of evolution by natural selection (see 1858). Granted that in every generation of a particular species there are random variations, there are also (to some extent, at least) random matings. Therefore, the variations should tend to vanish into an average, since extremes are not likely to mate with similar extremes. (It might even be argued that the second law of thermodynamics requires this tending toward an average.)

The flaw was corrected by an Austrian botanist and Augustinian monk, Gregor Johann Mendel (1822— 1884), who experimented with peas that he grew in the monastery garden.

Carefully, Mendel arranged for various plants to self-pollinate, wrapping them to guard against accidental pollination by insects. Carefully, he saved the seeds produced by each self-pollinated plant, planted them separately, and studied the new generation.

Mendel found that if he planted seeds from dwarf

pea plants, only dwarf pea plants sprouted. The seeds produced by this second generation also produced only dwarf pea plants. The dwarf pea plants “bred true.”

Seeds from tall pea plants behaved in a more complicated fashion. Some bred true, but some did not. Those that did not breed true gave rise to tall plants three-quarters of the time and to dwarf plants one-quarter of the time.

Mendel then crossed dwarf pea plants with the tall pea plants that bred true. All the peas produced grew into tall pea plants. The characteristics of dwarfness seemed to have disappeared.

Next Mendel had each of this new generation of tall plants self-pollinate and found that they produced peas that grew into tall plants and dwarf plants in a 3-to-1 ratio. Dwarfness had been submerged in one generation but had then shown up in the next.

In other words, tallness was dominant and dwarfness recessive, so that tallness overwhelmed dwarfness—but only temporarily.

Mendel found that other types of traits in pea plants worked the same way. There was 1o mixing of extremes.

Mendel also found that male and female contributed equally. It was as though each organism had two factors for a particular trait and each contributed one of them to the offspring. If the factors were different in the offspring, and one was dominant, the recessive characteristic didn’t show but was still there. [t might be the one handed on to the next generation, and if the other parent also handed on a recessive, so that the offspring had two recessives and no dominant, the recessive trait would appear again,

Mendel thus worked out the Mendelian laws of inheritance, as they were later to be called, and founded the science of genetics (from a Greek word meaning “to give birth to""”). He published his first paper on this work in 1865 (a second followed in 1869), but it was totally ignored for thirtythree years.

Since the Mendelian laws showed that extremes

e —————————————————————————————————————————————————

did not mix into a blind average, but continued to show up, they provided the mechanism by which natural selection could bring about a gradual change in species. Thus, Mendel corrected the flaw in Darwin, but both Mendel and Darwin were dead before the world of science came to realize what had happened.

1865,Benzene Ring,['Kekule'],['Kekule'],"Kekule's way of writing chemical formulas (see 1858) did not solve all problems. There was one compound, benzene, which was extremely important, being involved in the molecular structure of the new artificial dyes, for instance (see 1856), that did not yield to his system.

The molecule of benzene is made up of six carbon atoms and six hydrogen atoms. Given a chain of six carbon atoms, there seemed to be no way of adding six hydrogen atoms without producing a very unstable compound— and benzene was quite stable.

It was Kekule himself who found the answer in 1865. According to his own story, he was in a semidoze in a horse-drawn bus and was visualizing carbon chains when suddenly the tail end of one chain

attached itself to the head end and formed a spinning ring. At once he saw that if he imagined the six carbon atoms forming a hexagonal ring, with one hydrogen atom attached to each carbon, a stable atom might be the result. Once the notion of carbon rings was added to that of carbon chains, many structural problems were solved.

271,Avogadro’s Number,"['Hydrogen', 'Avogadro', 'Johann Joseph Loschmidt', 'Maxwell', 'Avogadro Avogadro', 'Avogadro Anesthetics', 'Joseph Lister', 'Pasteur', 'Lister', 'Semmelweiss']","['Austrian', 'British', 'Greek']","The hydrogen molecule is composed of two hydrogen atoms. The hydrogen atom has an atomic weight of Jjust about 1, so that a hydrogen molecule has a molecular weight of 2. Hydrogen gas is made up of hydrogen molecules, and at 0° C and normal atmospheric pressure at sea level, 22 4 liters (5.9 gallons) of hydrogen gas weigh 2 grams. This is the molecular weight in grams, or 1 mole.

Since equal volumes of gases are made up of equal numbers of molecules, according to Avogadro’s hypothesis (see 1811), and since each oxygen molecule has a weight of 32, then 22 4 liters of oxygen gas would weigh 32 grams—or 1 mole.

In fact, 224 liters of

any gas are likely to weigh 1 mole.

The question is, how many molecules are there in 224 liters of a gas? In 1865 the Austrian chemist Johann Joseph Loschmidt (1821-1895) used Maxwell’s kinetic theory of gases (see 1859) to calculate what that number ought to be. It turned out to be about 600,000,000,000,000,000,000,000, or six hundred billion trillion. Since all this was based on Avogadro’s hypothesis, the number was called Avogadro's number.

From Avogadro’s number, you could calculate the actual mass of a hydrogen molecule, since it would be 2 grams divided by six hundred billion trillion. A hydrogen atom would have a mass half that, and the mass of other atoms and molecules could be calculated as well.

For the first time, scientists had a notion, and a rather good one, as it turned out, of the mass of the tiny atoms and molecules that made up matter.

Antiseptic surgery

Anesthetics had come into use nearly twenty vears before (see 1846), but if the process had become more  nearly painless, it still remained deadly. The operation might be successful, yet the patient might develop inflammation and die.

In 1865 the British surgeon Joseph Lister (1827 1912) learned of Pasteur’s germ theory of disease (see 1862) and it occurred to him that death after operations might result from a germ infection to which the traumatized tissues were particularly susceptible. The germs producing the infection might come from the doctors themselves, or from their instruments.

Lister therefore instituted the practice of using phenol solutions to clean hands and instruments, and the death rate after operations dropped at once. Semmelweiss had attempted the same thing seventeen years earlier (see 1847), but without the justification of Pasteur’s theory, and physicians refused to listen. This shows the importance of theory in the most practical of affairs.

Eventually, chemicals less irritating and more effective than phenol were used, and antiseptic (from Greek words meaning “against putrefaction’’) surgery became the rule.

271,Maxwell’s Equations,"['Maxwell', 'Maxwell Maxwell', 'Maxwell Mobius Strip']","['Maxwell', 'Newton', 'German', 'Mobius']","The culminating work of Maxwell (see 1855) came in 1865 when he began to devise a set of equations (Maxwell's equations), simple in form, that expressed all the varied phenomena of electricity and magnetism and bound them together indissolubly, as Newton had done for gravitation. Maxwell showed that

electricity and magnetism did not exist separately, but that each was an inevitable aspect of the other. There was a single electromagnetie force.

Maxwell showed that the oscillation of an electric charge produced an electromagnetic field that radiated outward from its source at a constant speed. This speed could be calculated from the equations and turned out to be just the speed of light. Maxwell

therefore maintained that light was a form of electromagnetic radiation and that the wavelengths of such radiation depended on the oscillation rate of the charge and could be anything—far shorter than the ultraviolet and far longer than the infrared, for example. (Two decades later, this view was to be confirmed.)

In this way, Maxwell brought about the first unification in physics, or the first bringing under the umbrella of a single set of mathematical relationships such apparently disparate phenomena as electricity, magnetism, and light. Further unifications of this sort were to involve major efforts by later physicists.

Mobius Strip In 1865 the German mathematician August Ferdinand Maobius (1790—1868) presented what came to be called a Mobius strip. This is a long, flat strip of paper (or other flexible material) that is given a half twist and the two ends then pasted together to give a circular figure. The resulting construction has but one edge and one side. This made Mobius one of the founders of topology, the branch of mathematics that deals with those prop-

erties of figures that are not altered by deformations (as long as there is no tearing).

A lock becomes more useful if it is small and not easily picked; if the key is small and not easily duplicated. No lock can be perfect, but some are obviously better than others.

In 1865 an American

locksmith, Linus Yale (1821-1868), patented a cylinder lock with tumblers that had to be brought into a certain alignment if the lock was to open. The key had a serrated edge that sufficed to bring the tumblers into line. A vast number of combinations were possible, so that every key could be unique, even if there were millions of locks. The ar locks and keys that ontrolled house and apartment doors ever since are based on this principle.

1866,Dynamite,"['Alfred Bernhard Nobel', 'Nobel', 'Nobel Nobel']","['Sobrero', 'Swedish', 'Greek']","During the twenty years since nitroglycerine had been discovered by Sobrero (see 1847), it had been used in blasting roads through mountains, digging canals, and laying foundations. It fulfilled such tasks admirably, but it was such a touchy explosive that it sometimes blew up at the wrong time, destroying factories and killing people as well.

The Swedish inventor Alfred Bernhard Nobel (1833—-1896) was a member of a family that produced nitroglycerine and had lost a brother in an explosion. He therefore sought a way of taming nitroglycerine. In 1866 he came across a cask

of nitroglycerine that had leaked. The liquid had been absorbed by the packing, however, which consisted of diatomaceous earth, or kieselguhr (made up of the siliceous skeletons of myriads of microscopic diatoms).

The soaked kieselguhr remained dry, and Nobel experimented with the mixture. He found that the nitroglycerine could not be set off without a detonating cap once it had been mixed with kieselguhr. Short of that, the mixture could be handled virtually with impunity. Once set off, though, the nitroglycerine in the kieselguhr retained its shattering quality.

Nobel called the combination dynamite (from the

Greek word for “power”), and it replaced free nitroglycerine, initiating the era of safe use of explosives in construction. (At his death, Nobel left his estate of nearly ten million dollars for the establishment of the annual Nobel prizes.)

no more than 6 inches long, which took only 5 minutes to produce results. With this elinical thermometer, taking a patient’s temperature became truly routine.

It was clear that they were not evenly distributed, and the American astronomer Daniel Kirkwood (1814— 1895) showed in 1866 that there were definite gaps, since called “Kirkwood gaps.”

He explained these gaps by postulating that any asteroids that would have been in those gaps would revolve around the Sun in a period that bore a simple ratio to the period of Jupiter. That meant that every two or three turns of the asteroid would bring it into the same position with respect to Jupiter. Jupiter's gravitational pull would then be cumulative, and the asteroid would be forced either farther from the Sun or nearer to it, leaving a gap.

He pointed out that the gaps in Saturn's rings existed for similar reasons. If there were ring particles in Cassini’s division, for instance, those particles would revolve about Saturn in just half the period of Saturn's satellite, Mimas.

1867,Earth’s Iron Core,"['Cavendish', 'Earth', 'Earth Brahe', 'Kepler']","['French', 'Earth']","Ever since Cavendish had determined the Earth’s mass (see 1798), it had been known that the Earth's average density was about twice that of its rocky crust. The conclusion was that Earth’s center must be made of material that was denser than rock. Metal seemed to be the only reasonable alternative.

The French geologist Gabriel-Auguste Daubrée (1814—-1896), considering the fact that a number of meteorites were composed of a nickel-iron alloy (though most were rocky), assumed that if meteorites were remnants of an exploded planet, the rocky ones came from the outer-

Lt d

most portions of the planet, and the nickel-iron ones came from its core. He reasoned that this would be true of Earth as well, so that Earth had a nickeliron core. This has been accepted by geologists ever since.

Composition of a Nova

They had to be, since the chemical reactions required to produce an electric current proceeded in solution. Batteries containing fluid had to be handled with care. They could be easily tipped and spilled, and the fluid was usually corrosive.

In 1867, however, a French engineer, Georges Leclanché (1839-1882), devised a cell and, experimenting over the course of twenty years, gradually

converted its fluid into a stiff paste by adding flour and plaster of Paris.

In the end, while such a cell was not really dry, it was not so wet that it would spill. It could be thrown about, placed on its side, and turned upside down without being adversely affected. It came to be called a dry cell. It was these dry cells that came to be used in myriads of small devices from flashlights to children’s toys.

(The text of a piece of writing before it is published is still called a manuscript, from Latin words meaning “handwritten.”) Attempts had been made to devise machines that could print letters when certain levers were struck, but they usually proved extremely cumbersome and worked much more slowly than a person could write.

The first writing machine that was reasonably compact and, with practice, could be made to print at least as quickly as people could write was built by an American inventor, Christopher Latham Sholes (1819—

1890). He constructed his first machine in 1867 and patented it the next year.

The Norwegian chemists Cato Maximilian Guldberg (1836—1902) and his brother-in-law, Peter Waage (1833—1900), showed that it was not mass alone that did this but concentration; that is, the quantity of mass in a given volume. The rule, known as the law of mass action, was promulgated in 1867 and helped lead the way toward the application of thermodynamics to chemical reactions

1868,Air Brake,"['Failure', 'George Westinghouse', 'Cornelius Vanderbilt']",['American'],"Advances in technology invariably pose problems in safety. For instance, a locomotive with a number of carriages following it has a huge mass and consequently a huge inertia. Traveling, as it might, at a high speed, it would take an enormous force to decelerate and bring it to a halt. Failure to do so could well make collisions inevitable and extremely deadly.

In 1868 the American engineer George Westinghouse (1846—1914) invented the air brake, which used compressed air rather than human muscle. Such an air brake could be applied simultaneously to every wheel on the train. Cornelius Vanderbilt (1794— 1877), the American train magnate, dismissed the idea as a “fool notion” be-

cause he did not believe that one could stop a train by the use of air. However, the air brake, after some improvements, caught on quickly and greatly increased rail safety.

1868,Helium,"['Joseph Norman Lockyer', 'Janssen']","['India', 'European', 'French', 'British', 'Lockyer', 'Greek']","Improvements in transportation had made it possible for astronomers to travel all over the world if they had to. The most spectacular astronomical phenomenon that might be confined to a small area almost anywhere in the world was a total eclipse of the Sun. When an eclipse was due to be visible at certain areas in India in 1868, European astronomers didn't hesitate to make the journey.

A French astronomer at the site, Pierre-Jules-César Janssen (1824—1907), studied the spectra of the solar

prominences (see 1859). Meanwhile, a British astronomer, Joseph Norman Lockyer (1836-1920), showed that by allowing light from the edge of the Sun to pass through a prism, he could obtain spectra of prominences even without an eclipse.

Janssen observed a spectral line that did not match any of the known lines in position. He sent a report on this to Lockyer, who decided that the line represented a hitherto unknown element. The element was named helium, from the Greek word for “sun.” (Since then, a number of strange lines have been found in astronomical light sources, and other new elements have been postulated, but helium— the first of these—remains the only one to have proven truly a new element,  though this was not pr until a quarter-century later.)

1869,Periodic Table of the Elements,"['Dmitry Ivanovich Mendeleyev', 'Mendeleyev', 'Julius Lothar Meyer', 'Mendeleyev Mendeleyev']","['Newlands', 'Russian', 'Newlands German', 'Sanskrit']","Newlands had tried to set up a table of elements that would allow them to be grouped into natural families (see 1863). A Russian

chemist, Dmitry Ivanovich Mendeleyev (1834-1907), now tried his hand at the task.

Like Newlands, Mendeleyev arranged the elements in order of increasing atomic weight. However, he did not try to

be too simple and arrange them in a fixed gridwork of seven elements per row. Instead, letting himself be guided by the valence of each element, he allowed the length of the period (row) to increase. He had hydrogen all by itself, then two periods of seven elements each, then two periods of seventeen elements each. He had prepared what is now called the periodic table of the elements.

He published his table on March 6, 1869, beating out others who were attempting the same task, notably the German chemist Julius Lothar Meyer (18301895).

In 1871 Mendeleyev went a step further, one which put him in a class by himself. In order to keep the valences and other properties of elements similar as one looked down the columns of his table, he had to leave empty spaces. He did not view this as an imperfection in his table. He merely announced that the empty spaces represented elements that had not yet been discovered.

He picked out three gaps in particular, one under boron, one under

aluminum, and one under silicon, and called them eka-boron, eka-aluminum, and eka-silicon. (Eka is “one"" in Sanskrit, so that each element is one below the indicated element in the periodic table.)

Mendeleyev went on to predict the properties of the missing elements according to their places in the table. Naturally, no one paid this serious attention at the time, but Mendeleyev turned out to be right.

1869,Nucleic Acid,['Johann Friedrich Miescher'],['Swiss'],"The classification of foodstuffs into carbohydrates, fats, and proteins (see 1827) still seemed quite satisfactory. In 1869, however, a Swiss biochemist, Johann Friedrich Miescher (1844— 1895), isolated a substance from the remnants of cells in pus that did not belong to any of these three classes. It contained both nitrogen and phosphorus. Miescher took his new discovery to Hoppe-Seyler (see 1862), who investigated the matter himself. When he discovered a similar substance in yeast, the discovery was announced. Since the material seemed to originate in cell nuclei, it was called nuclein at first, and later, because it had

It was not till threequarters of a century later that the true and overwhelming importance of nucleic acid was appreciated.

Andrews carefully raised the temperature of carbon dioxide and found that, as the temperature went up, more and more pressure was required to liquefy it. Finally, at 31°C, no pressure he could apply would turn the trick. The gas might become as dense as a liquid, but it would still retain gaseous properties.

Andrews therefore suggested, in 1869, that for every gas there was a critical temperature above which pressure alone could not liquefy it. This was useful for chemists to know, because in their efforts to liquefy the so-called permanent gases, they would clearly have to lower the

In 1869 he drew a line separating the two types of animals (a line still called Wallace's line), which followed the deep-water channel between the large islands of Borneo and Bali to the west and Celebes and Lombok to the east.

Clearly, the animals in Australia and Asia had been separated for a long time and had gone their separate evolutionary ways. Out of this grew the notion of dividing animal species into large continental and supercontinental blocks. This founded the science of biogeography.

Then a prize of ten thousand dollars (a fortune in those days) was offered for a substance cheaper than ivory but just as good, for the manufacture of billiard balls.

An American inventor, John Wesley Hyatt (18371920), wanted the prize money and had heard of pyroxylin. Hyatt improved on Parkes’s method of preparing it and in 1869 patented his method of manufacturing billiard balls out of this material, which he named celluloid.

He did not win the prize, but celluloid enjoyed a minor boom as a material for baby rattles, shirt collars, photographic film, and other products. It was light, flexible, waterproof, and zasily cleaned. Its one great flaw was that it was flammable. Celluloid was the first commercially successful plastic.

It was impossible, however, to suppose that biological evolution had shaped life in general but had somehow refrained from touching human beings. It quickly turned out, then, that there was no point in ignoring the most important (to human beings) of all aspects of evolution.

Now, in 1871, Darwin published The Descent of Man, in which he applied the principles of evolution to humanity specifically. He pointed out the vestigial organs in man as evidence of descent from nonhuman animals: the trace of a point to human ears, the existence of useless muscles

that once moved those ears, the four small bones at the bottom of the spine that were once tailbones, and so on. There were still no fossil remnants, however, that could give information as to the details of human ancestry. (Even the Neanderthals were too like ourselves to be useful in this respect.)

It seemed to a German psychologist, Wilhelm Wundt (1832-1920), that there were facets of human behavior that could be profitably measured. There was, for instance, the manner in which the human brain handled sense impressions. He thus initiated experimental psychology, writing a textbook on the subject in 1872. He went on in later years to establish the first laboratory devoted to experimental psychology and the first journal devoted to publishing findings on the subject.

1873,Gas Laws,"['Johannes Diderik', 'Waals', 'Waals Waals']","['Boyle', 'Dutch', 'Waals']","Ever since Boyle (see 1662), it had been known that

gases obeyed certain rules, which interrelated volume, pressure, and temperature.

In 1873, however, the Dutch physicist Johannes Diderik van der Waals (1837—1923) showed that

gases would obey those sim-

ple laws exactly only if the volume of the molecules

themselves were zero and if there were no attraction between them. Actually, molecules do have a small volume and there is a small attraction between them. If the pressure on the gas is  low and the temperature is high, these facts scarcely matter, but as pressure goes up and temperature goes down, the facts grow increasingly important.

In 1873 van der Waals introduced a modified equation that gases followed much more closely than they do the simpler, unmodified one. Only perfect gases (which have zero-volume molecules and no intermolecular attraction—and which don'’t exist in reality) follow the unmodified equations.

As a result of van der Waals's work, it could be seen that the Joule-Thomson effect—that gases cool as they expand (see 1852)— only holds below a certain temperature. For most gases, that doesn’t matter, because the temperature below which the effect holds is quite high. In the case of hydrogen, however, that temperature is quite low, so that attempts to liguefy hydrogen by means of the Joule-Thomson effect would fail if the gas was not sufficiently cooled to begin with.

In 1910 van der Waals received a Nobel Prize in physics for this work.

Those irrational numbers that cannot serve as solutions are called transcendental numbers (from Latin words meaning ""“to climb beyond,"" since they climb beyond the algebraic numbers to further heights). The trick is, however, to prove that a particular number is transcendental and that no conceivable polynomial equation can yield it as a result.

In 1873 a French math-

1873,Tetrahedral Carbon Atom,"['Kekule', 'Jacobus Hendricus', 'Hoft']","['Kekule', 'Dutch', 'Hoff', 'Greek', 'French']","Kekule’s way of writing the formulas of organic molecules (see 1858), now fifteen years old, was essentially two-dimensional. The four valence bonds of the carbon atom were directed toward the four angles of a square. That was inadequate for some purposes. For instance, some organic molecules, in solution, rotated the plane of polarized light. That meant the molecules must be asymmetric in one

way or another, but the asymmetry wasn't visible in the Kekule formulas.

In 1874 a Dutch physical chemist, Jacobus Hendricus van't Hoff (1852— 1911), advanced a three-dimensional representation of organic molecules. In his system, the four bonds of the carbon atom pointed toward the vertices of a tetrahedron, so that the atom could rest on three of the bonds as though it were a splayed-out three-legged stool, with the fourth bond pointing straight upward, each bond equidistant from the other three.

This tetrahedral carbon atom produced the necessary asymmetry. If four different groups were attached to the four valence  bonds of a particular carbon atom, two distinct molecules could be formed, one being the mirror image of the other.

If one of these compounds twisted the plane of polarization clockwise, the other would twist it counterclockwise. Indeed, any compound shown by the tetrahedral carbon atom to be asymmetric was in fact optically active when tested, twisting the plane of polarized light in one direction or the other. Any compound not shown to be asymmetric was not.

The way the tetrahedral carbon atom explained optical activity was so useful that the new outlook was adopted quickly. Van't Hoft’s way of looking at formulas was considered stereochemistry, from the Greek meaning “solid chemistry,” since the molecules were pictured in three dimensions.

A French chemist, Joseph-Achille Le Bel (1847— 1930), advanced the tetrahedral carbon atom at about the same time, independently.

You can match up every even number to an ordinary number half its size so that the total number of even numbers is just as great as the total number of all numbers. (This had been pointed out by Galileo two and a half centuries before.)

The German mathematician Georg Ferdinand Ludwig Philipp Cantor (1845-1918) used this sort of one-to-one correspondence to show that all fractions are denumerable and can be counted by the integers.

However, all real numbers (rational plus irrational) cannot be counted by the integers. Whatever sys tem one uses to count them will always leave out an infinite number. The group of real numbers represents a higher infinity, a transfinite number. Furthermore, all real numbers correspond to

the points in a line, so that points are also nondenunierable.

Cantor showed that transfinite numbers themselves exist in an endless number, which is larger than the ordinary infinity of the integers.

Thus, in 1874, a German physicist, Karl Ferdinand Braun (1850—1918), noted that in the case of some crystals, an electric current would pass through in one direction but not in the other. He didn’t know the reason for it, or what could be done with it, but as it turned out, it was an enormously important finding leading to amazing consequences in later years.

Nevertheless, such a union was not observed until the German embryologist Oskar Wilhelm August Hertwig (1849-1922) saw a sperm cell actually enter the egg cell of a sea urchin. What's more, although sperm cells are produced in swarming plenty, Hertwig could see that but a single

sperm cell entered the egg cell and that it sufficed for fertilization.

1876,Radiometer,[],['Crookes'],"In 1875 Crookes (see 1861) devised the radiometer, consisting of a set of pivoted vanes in a vacuum. One side of each vane was blackened so that it would absorb heat, and the other side was shiny so that it would reflect it. In the presence of sunlight, the vanes turned steadily. This was

not due to solar radiation, for if the container was evacuated particularly well, the motion ceased. Actually, the air molecules in the imperfect vacuum rebounded from the heated side more strongly than from the cooler, shiny side, thus “kicking” it around. This required a partial vacuum to work, as otherwise air resistance would muffle the motion. The radiometer was only a toy, but it offered vivid support for the kinetic theory of gases.

1876,Telephone,"['Alexander Graham Bell', 'Watson', 'Thomas Augustus Watson', 'Otto']","['American', 'German']","The telegraph, now over thirty years old, transmitted only signals. The British-born American inventor Alexander Graham Bell (1847-1922) wanted some-

thing better than that. He wanted to send actual speech over the wires, by turning sound waves into a fluctuating electric current that waxed and waned as the sound waves compressed and decompressed

air. The electric current could then be reconverted into sound at the other end. He finally invented a device capable of doing that and first made use of it accidentally. He had spilled battery acid on his pants  and automatically cried out to his assistant, “Watson, please come here. I want you.” Thomas Augustus Watson (1854-1934), at the other end of the circuit on another floor, heard the instrument speak and ran downstairs. On March 7, 1876, Bell

patented the telephone. Ed-

The telephone utterly revolutionized human communication.

Four-Stroke Engine

The Lenoir internal-comn de3 before, but its inefficiency was recognized (see 1860).

A German engir kolaus August Otto (1

bustion engine had b vised sixte

which the piston made four

strokes. As the piston moved outward (first stroke), a mixture of air and inflammable vapor would be drawn into the cylinder. As the piston moved inward (second stroke), the mixture would be compressed, and at the

height of the compression, a spark would set off an explosion. The explosion would drive the piston outward (third stroke, which would supply the power that did the work). As the piston moved inward (fourth stroke), the waste

gases would be forced out. The cycle would then be repeated.

Otto built such a fourcycle engine in 1876. The Otto engine, as it was called, was such a vast improvement that it caught on at once and was the  basis for the internalcombustion engines of today.

1876,Chemical Thermodynamics,"['Josiah Willard Gibbs', 'Gibbs']",['American'],"Thermodynamics, although worked out originally through the study of heat (see 1850), applies to all forms of energy. An American physicist, Josiah Willard Gibbs (1839—-1903), applied it to chemical change.

He wrote a series of papers on the subject that totaled four hundred pages and appeared, over a twoyear period beginning in 1876, in The Transactions of the Connecticut Academy of Sciences. In the course of his papers, he evolved the modern concepts of free energy and chemical potential as the driving force behind chemical reactions.

In the papers, he also considered equilibria (singular, equilibrium: the point at which a system comes to rest and there is no further change) between different phases (liguid, solid, or gas), where one or more components of a system are involved. The number of ways (degrees of freedom) in which temperature, pressure, or concentration can be varied in such

cases can be expressed by a simple equation, which Gibbs called the phase rule. By the time he was through, Gibbs had left little more to do in what is now called chemical thermodynamics.

1876,Bacterial Cultivation,"['Robert Koch', 'Pasteur', 'Koch']","['Silesia', 'Germany']","When an anthrax epidemic struck the cattle in Silesia (eastern Germany), a local physician, Robert Koch (1843-1910), grew interested. In 1876 he located the particular bacterium that caused anthrax in the spleen of infected cattle and transferred it to mice, carrying the infection from mouse to mouse and recovering the same bacilli in the end. More important still, he learned to cultivate the bacteria outside the living body, using blood serum at body temperature.

Then he learned to make use of solid media for growing bacteria—gelatin, or a complex carbohydrate called agar, which could be obtained from seaweed. When grown in such solid media, the bacteria could not move about easily, and if the bacteria happened to be isolated in one spot, they would, by division and redi-

vision, give rise to a patch of descendant bacteria with noadmixture of outside varieties. Bacteria could then be transmitted to animals or allowed to start new cultures with the certainty that only a particular strain of bacteria was being worked with.

In short, Pasteur's germ theory was given practical application by Koch. Koch showed how the causative bacteria could be isolated, then used to produce the disease, then regained from the diseased animal, and finally worked with to find a prevention or cure.

1877,Cathode Rays,"['Eugen Goldstein', 'Goldstein', 'Franklin']","['German', 'Pliicker']","There was increasing interest in the passage of electric currents through a vacuum. In 1876 a German physicist, Eugen Goldstein (1850-1930), repeated the work of Pliicker, nearly two decades before (see 1858). Goldstein thought the fluorescence in the evacnated tube seemed to form as though a stream of radiation had traveled from the cathode (the negatively charged electrode) to the spot on the glass where the fluorescence appeared. He therefore described the phenomenon as cathode rays. This was the first indi-

cation that Franklin might have been wrong in his decision that electricity flowed from what he had arbitrarily considered positive to what he had arbitrarily considered negative (see 1752). In the evacuated tube, certainly, the electric current seemed to be flowing from the negative.

1877,Protein Size,"['Wilhelm Friedrich Philipp Pfeffer', 'Pfeffer', 'Pfeffer Pfeffer']",['German'],"The fact of osmosis—that some substances could go through certain membranes while others could not—had been known for two decades. In 1877 a German botanist, Wilhelm Friedrich Philipp Pfeffer (1845-1920), explained the phenomenon by showing that large molecules would not go through, while small ones would. If all the large molecules were on one side of the membrane, they would block the passage of some of the small ones. That meant that more small molecules would pass through from the side that lacked the large molecules. The side with the large molecules would then swell, as more small molecules entered than left, and it would experience an osmotic pressure.

Pfeffer showed how one might measure this osmotic pressure and related that

pressure to the size of the molecules that could not pass through the membrane. If a particular protein was on one side of the membrane, then from the osmotic pressure developed on that side Pfeffer could calculate the molecular weight of the protein. Pfeffer was also the first to determine the molecular weights of proteins and to show that they were macromolecules made up of hundreds, even thousands, of atoms.

In 1877 a French physi-

cist, Louis-Paul Cailletet (1832-1913), cooled oxygen intensively and then let it expand. He got a fog of liguid droplets of oxygen. By using similar techniques, he also managed to get small quantities of

liquid nitrogen and

liquid carbon menoxide

as well.

A Swiss chemist, Raoul-Pierre Pictet (1846— 1929), managed to do this independently in the same year. Using a more elaborate method, he produced greater quantities of the liguids.

As it turned out, oxygen liquefied at —183°C (90° K): carbon monoxide at —191° C (82° K); and nitrogen at — 196° C (77° K). The only known gas that remained a gas at the temperature that sufficed to liquefy nitrogen was hydrogen. (Two other

vet unknown, would also have remained unliquefiable at this time.)  Phonograph

In 1876 Edison had opened the first industrial research laboratory, at Menlo Park, New Jersey. In 1877, the same year in which he improved the telephone mouthpiece in a crucial manner, he also made what he always said was his favorite invention—the phonograph (from Greek words meaning “sound-writing"""").

He put tinfoil on a eylinder, set a free-floating needle skimming over it as the cylinder turned, and connected a source that would carry sound waves to the needle. The needle, vibrating in time to the sound waves, impressed a wavering track on the tin. Afterward, following that track, the needle reproduced the sound waves in a form that was a bit distorted but recognizable.

We all know what the phonograph, and its much improved descendants, have done to bring music (good and bad) into the home.

Mars is then only 35,000,000 miles from Earth, and astronomers get ready to study it

carefully. One of these close approaches (or conjunctions) took place in 1877, and one of those interested was the Italian astronomer Giovanni Virginio Schiaparelli (1835-1910).

For one thing, he tried to map Mars. Even 35,000,000 miles is a large distance, and the Martian atmosphere tends to obscure things (to say nothing of our own atmosphere), so that earlier attempts to map the shadowy markings on Mars had not been very successful; different astronomers saw different markings. Schiaparelli, however, recorded what he saw with so good a telescope and so clear an eye that, for once, other astronomers saw the same markings he did. Schiaparelli gave the markings classical names, and others were content to use those names.

Schiaparelli did more. At this time, and at later, less favorable conjunctions of Mars, he detected rather narrow, dark markings. He thought they were bodies of water, so he called the narrow ones channels. The Italian word for channels was canali, and this was mistranslated back into English as canals.

The difference is that channels refers to natural bodies of narrow water, while canals are made by

intelligent beings. The notion came into being, then, that Mars was a dying world, with its water slowly leaking into space; and that it was home for a superintelligent race, for whom the canals were a huge engineering development designed to bring water from the polar ice caps to the agricultural tropics. It was nearly a century before that notion was to be quashed once and for

all.

Of the inner planets, Earth had one satellite, but no satellites were known for Mercury, Venus, or Mars.

At the 1877 conjunction of Earth and Mars, the American astronomer Asaph Hall (1829-1907) seized the opportunity to make certain that Mars had no satellites. If it did have, they would have to be small and dim, and might well be very close to Mars, whose light would tend to obscure them. Without all three of those qualifications, they would certainly have been seen by now.

Hall therefore began to  search the neighborhood of Mars for any signs of little sparks moving about the planet. He worked inward toward Mars'’s surface and, by August 11, his telescope was trained so close to Mars that its glare was beginning to make it impossible to see anything else. He

decided to give it up and assume that satellites were not present, but his wife, Angelina Stickney Hall, urged him to try for one more night.

Hall agreed, and the next night he spotted a small satellite. Five nights of clouds followed, and

then on August 17 he noted tellite. The satellites were small indeed, the smallest that had yet been discovered, but they were there. Hall named them Phobos (Greek for “fear”) and Deimos (Greek for “terror”), after the two sons of Mars (Ares), the god of war.

1878,Enzyme,"['Wilhelm Friedrich', 'Willy']","['German', 'Kuhne', 'Greek']","At this time biological catalysts were called ferments, whether they existed in intact cells or could be isolated as nonliving substances. The German physiologist Wilhelm Friedrich (Willy) Kuhne (1837-1900) clung to a vitalist position and felt that “ferment” belonged to living systems only.

In 1878 he suggested calling substances that could exert a catalytic effect when separated from living tissue enzymes (from Greek words meaning “'in

yeast,” because enzymes acted like materials in the living cells of yeast).

In less than two decades, however, the distinction between biological catalysts inside and outside cells was to be lost, and the word enzymes, originally implying an inferior status, came to be applied to all such catalysts indiscriminately.

1878,Varves,"['Agassiz', 'Gerard Jakob', 'Geer']","['Swedish', 'Geer', 'Swedish Middle']","Forty years before, Agassiz had shown that an Ice Age had existed in the past (see 1837). Careful studies since

had indicated the presence of several ice ages separated by warm interglacial periods. However, the times when the ice had come and gone, or the lengths of these ice ages and interglacial periods, were shrouded in uncertainty.

In 1878 a Swedish geologist, Gerard Jakob de Geer (1858-1943), studying the sediments in glacier-fed lakes, found that layers of fine silt and coarser sediment alternated, depending on whether the layers were laid down in the winter or in the summer  By counting the varves (Swedish for “layers”), and counting each fine/coarse accumulation as one year, de Geer estimated that the process had been going on for twelve thousand years. That meant it had been twelve thousand years ago that the glaciers of the most recent ice age had retreated. (This was about the time agriculture was

coming into use, in the Middle East—see 8000 B.C.)

By studying the thickness of the varves, some idea of changing climate could also be obtained.

This was the first technique for counting thousands of years with considerable accuracy. A number of other such techniques were to be developed later.

1879,Electric Light,"['Edison', 'Edison Finally', 'Edison Edison', 'Menlo Park']","['Davy', 'New Year']","With a source of energy like electricity, there seemed a chance of having light without flame. A current forced across an air gap can produce a bright spark, and arc lights had been introduced by Davy (see 1800) nearly three-quarters of a century before, but the light was harsh and the danger of fire was great. Edison now tackled the problem of an alternate form of electric lighting.

Electricity passing through a wire warmed it because of the wire's resistance. If the resistance was made great enough by mak-

ing the wire thin enough, the wire would heat to incandescence. If it did so, however, it would either melt or burn.

To prevent burning, the wire filament would have to be in an evacuated glass bulb. That would also soften the light and lessen the danger of fire to nearly nothing.

That still left the problem of finding a conductor that would not melt. Edison spent a considerable time experimenting with platinum wire, but platinum was too expensive— and wouldn’t work

Finally, after thousands of experiments, Edi-

son found what he wanted, and it wasn't a metal at all. He used a scorched cotton thread, which proved to be equivalent of a carbon wire. On October 21, 1879, Edison sent a current through such a filament in an evacuated glass bulb. It burned for 40 continuous hours. Edison promptly obtained a patent, and on the following New Year's Eve, he illuminated the in street of Menlo Park using his electric light bulbs be-

fore a crowd of three thousand.

To make the light bulb useful, Edison had to develop a generating that would supply electric-

1879,Origin of the Moon,"['George Howard Darwin', 'Charles Darwin', 'Earth', 'Earth Earth', 'Earth George Darwin']","['Newton', 'British', 'Earth']","Newton had thought that tides were the result of gravitational attraction by the Moon. The British astronomer George Howard Darwin (1845-1912), the second son of Charles Darwin, went into the matter with particular care.

He realized that the flow of water around the Earth as it turned swept that water across shallow arms of the seas and up sloping shorelines. This produced a certain friction and converted some of the energy of Earth’s rotatory motion into heat.

This meant that Earth'’s rotation was slowing and its period of rotation (the length of the day) was lengthening at a very slow rate. That meant, in turn, that some of the Earth's angular momentum was disappearing. However, the angular momentum could not disappear into nothingness, for there was a law of conservation

of angular momentum. If the Earth lost some, then it seemed most likely that the Moon would have to gain just the amount Earth lost. The simplest way for the Moon to gain the angular momentum was for it to move very slowly away from the Earth.

If this seenario were played backward in time, we would see the Moon coming closer and closer to Earth and Earth’s day growing shorter and shorter.

George Darwin suggested that the Moon was once part of the Earth, in fact, and because Earth was spinning very rapidly in primordial times, part of its outermost region whirled off and became the Moon.

Although this suggestion is not accepted today, it was very dramatic and interesting in its time.

time, however, Fahlberg happened to put his fingers to his mouth without knowing that a few grains of the new compound had adhered to them. He was astonished by an intensely Sweet taste.

An element that was not exactly one of the rare earth series, but that rather resembled them in its properties, was discovered in 1879 by the Swedish chemist Lars Fredrik Nilson (1840—1899). He named it scandium, for Scandinavia.

The Swedish chemist Per Teodor Cleve (1840— 1905) pointed out soon afterward that its properties were exactly those of Mendeleyev's “eka-boron” (see 1869) and that it fit into the periodic table just where eka-boron had been placed. A second of Mendeleyev's predicted elements had thus been discovered.  Thulium, Holmium, and Samarium

If scandium was not quite a rare earth element, other elements were discovered that were. Cleve, who identified scandium as ekaboron (see above), isolated two new rare earth elements in 1879. He gave both of them names of Scandinavian aura. One was thulium, after Thule, which in classic legend was the land farthest to the north, and which was interpreted by later Europeans as representing Scandinavia. The other he named holmium, after Stockholm. In the same year, Lecoq de Boisbaudran, who

had discovered gallium (see 1874), identified a new rare earth element, which he named samarium, because he had found it in a mineral called samarskite, which, in turn, bore the name of an otherwise obscure Russian mining engineer named Samarski.

radiation of a body was proportional to the fourth power of its absolute temperature (Stefan's law).

For example, if a body's temperature tripled, from 1,000° K to 3,000° K, its radiation output would increase 3 X 3 X 3 X 3,0r 81 times. This very rapid increase of radiation with temperature was more of an increase than would have been expected and turned out to be of great use in deducing the evolution of stars. More immediately, from the total radiation of the Sun, its surface temperature was de duced from the rule, and turned out to be about 5,700° K.

sort it.

An American inventor, Herman Hollerith (1860— 1929), who worked for the census, thought there might be a better way of handling the data, and beginning in 1880, he set about the task.

He made use of punch cards after the fashion of Jacquard (see 1801) and Babbage (see 1822). Each card could be punched to represent data gathered in

the census: holes in appropriate places could represent sex, age, occupation, and so on.

In order to add up and analyze all this information, the cards were placed on a stand and a metal device was pressed down against them. The device had many pins, which would be stopped by the cardboard. Wherever there was a hole, however, a pin would go through and reach a pool of mercury underneath. Electricity would pass through that pin and control the pointer on a dial. As the punch cards were sent rapidly through the machine, it was only necessary for people to record the numbers indicated on the dial.

What made all the difference between Hollerith and Babbage was that Hollerith had the use of electricity. He had developed an electromechanical calculator, and not merely a mechanical one.

Eventually, Hollerith founded a company devoted to making all kinds of machines that could handle and analyze information. That company developed into the International Business Machines Corporation, usually known simply as IBM.

Most of the reported observations could be explained equally well by supposing cathode rays to be either a form of electromagnetic radiation, like light, or a stream of particles.

The matter was investigated by Crookes (see 1861), who in 1875 had devised a vacuum tube that was even better than Geissler’s (see 1855).

In 1880, using his own Crookes tube, he showed that cathode rays traveled in straight lines and cast sharp shadows. The radiation could even turn a small wheel, which it struck on one side. This still left the nature of the rays uncertain.

But then Crookes showed that a magnet would cause cathode rays to curve in their path, and from the manner of curving, it seemed quite certain that they carried a negative electric charge. Since there seemed no way electromagnetic waves could carry such a charge, Crookes concluded that cathode rays were actually a stream of

electrically charged particles.

That decision held up in all subsequent studies.

back together—a way of treating light that Maxwell (see 1855) had suggested six years before. Then, no one had had an instrument capable of the job; now Michelson had one.

If the two portions of the light traveled precisely the same distance at the same speed, they would then come back together in phase, and the light would be unchanged, If their dis-

tance or speed were slightly different, however, the two beams would be slightly out of phase when they rejoined, and interference fringes should be set up such as those Young had detected and used to prove the wave nature of light (see 1801)

At this time, it was thought that light, being a wave, had to be a wave of something. Consequently, it was supposed that all space was filled with a luminiferous ether. (The word luminiferous is from Latin, meaning ‘‘light-carrying,” and erher harks back to Aristotle’s aether—see 350 B.C., Five Elements.) This luminiferous ether was thought to be in a state of absolute rest, and the Earth was thought to be moving at some particular speed relative to it, called Earth's absolute motion.

Michelson used his interlerometer to measure Farth's absolute motion by sending two halves of a light beam traveling at right angles to each other. Light sent in the direction of Earth’s motion through

the ether and back again ought to complete its trip little sooner than light tray-

o g

eling at right angles to the motion and back. Therefore the two halves of the light should rejoin out of phase, and by measuring the width of the interference fringes, one should be able to measure the speed of Earth relative to ether. Once that was known, the absolute motion of all other bodies should follow. However, the experiment failed. No interference fringes were found. Michelson assumed there was something wrong with the experiment and set about refining it. It took years before he was satisfied that there truly were no interference fringes. That observation helped revolutionize science.

1880,Anthrax Inoculation,"['Jenner', 'Pasteur', 'Pasteur Pasteur', 'Koch']",['Jenner'],"It had been three-quarters of a century since Jenner had successfully prevented smallpox by inoculating people with cowpox, a much milder disease that conferred immunity to the

more serious one (see 1796).

This feat could not be repeated in other cases because other serious diseases did not seem to have milder cousins. Pasteur decided, however, that one

might be able to manufacture those milder cousins in the laboratory.

Pasteur studied the deadly disease anthrax, which ravaged herds of domestic animals. Koch (see 1876) had reported observing the bacteria responsible for the disease. Pasteur confirmed Koch's finding and showed that the germs sometimes survived in the ground as heat-resistant spores for long periods of time. It was therefore necessary to kill all infected animals and bury them deep.

If an animal did survive anthrax, however, it was immune thereafter. Pasteur therefore prepared cultures of anthrax germs and heated them. In this way, he destroyed the activity and virulence of the germs but left an “attenuated"" preparation that could still produce immunity against anthrax.

In 1881 he carried through a dramatic experiment. Some sheep were inoculated with his attenuated germs; others were not. After a time, all the sheep seemed healthy, but when they were injected with deadly anthrax germs, those that had been inoculated lived; those that had not been inoculated died.

Pasteur, in tribute to Jenner, called the process vaccination, even though the disease vaccinia was not involved.

spherical bacterium of the kind called coccus (from a Greek word meaning “seed”). The pneumoniacausing bacterium

was therefore called preumococcus.

Such circles made it easier to handle statements like “All A are B""” or “Some A are B” or “A can be B or C but not both.” If Boole's work was a kind of algebraic logic, Venn's was geometric logic.  1882

1880,Chromatin,"['Perkin', 'Eduard Adolf Strasburger', 'Walther Flemming', 'Nucleus']","['German', 'Greek', 'German Greek', 'Greek Greek', 'Greek Mendel']","Studies of the intimate details of cellular structure through the microscope were hampered by the fact that the cell is transparent, so that the inner structure can ordinarily only be seen as gray on gray.

Perkin, however, had produced the first synthetic dye a quarter-century before (see 1856), and since then many others had been produced. It was possible that a dye might combine with some intracellular structures but not with others. In that case, the affected structures would stand out in bright colors

It was in this way that the German botanist Eduard Adolf Strasburger

(1844—1912) was able to observe some of the changes that took place during cell division among plants. In 1882 Strasburger divided protoplasm into two regions, one inside the nucleus, which he called nucleoplasm, and the other outside the nucleus, which he called cytoplasm (the prefix eyto- is from the Greek word for “cell”). These words, especially cytoplasm, are now common among biologists.

Much more thorough studies were made by the German anatomist Walther Flemming (1843-1905). He used a dye that combined with a material inside the nucleus that he called ¢hromatin, from the Greek word for “color.”

When he dyed a section of growing tissue, cells were caught at different stages of division. The cells were killed by the dye, of course, so that all cell divisions were stopped. What he saw, therefore, was a series of “stills” all jumbled together. Given enough observations, however, he could arrange the various stages in order and deduce what was happening.

As the proces vision began, the chromatin collected into short, threadlike objects, which eventually came to be called chromosomes (from

of cell di-

Greek words meaning

“colored bod Because

these threadlike chromosomes were so characteristic a feature of cell division,

e

Flemming named the process jmitosis, from a Greek word for ""thread.”

As cell division proceeded, the chromosomes doubled in number. Then came what seemed the crucial step: the chromosomes, entangled in the fine threads of a structure that Flemming named the aster (Greek for ""star’”’), were pulled apart, half going to one end of the cell and half to the other. The cell then divided, and the two offspring were each left with an equal supply of chromatin. Because the chromosomes had doubled before the division, each offspring had as much chromatin as the original undivided cell.

Flemming summarized his observations in Cell Substance, Nucleus, and Cell Division, which was published in 1882.

All this was of the highest significance, but scientists failed to draw the proper conclusions, because they didn’t know of Mendel's genetic work (see 1865).

ferometer—see 1881), measured the speed of light in 1882 and reported it to be 186,320 miles per second. This was over a thousand miles per second faster than Foucault had reported, and Michelson's value was the more accurate. In fact, it was less than 40 miles per second above the value that is currently accepted.

Diffraction gratings would form far better spectra, which much sharper lines, than prisms would, if the parallel scratches on glass or metal were fine enough and numerous enough.

The American physicist Henry Augustus Rowland (1848—1901) had devised a method for preparing gratings of unexampled fineness, and in 1882, he prepared a grating in which there were almost 15,000 lines per inch. Eventually, using gratings such as these, Rowland could prepare a map of the solar spectrum in which the precise wavelengths of some 14,000 spectral lines were given.

In 1882 Koch (see 1876) isolated the tubercle bacillus, the bacterium that caused tuberculosis. This led him to search for a cure, and for a while he thought he had one, but was disappointed. Still, such was the dread of the disease that merely identifying the germ seemed a feat important enough to warrant granting Koch a Nobel Prize in medicine and physiology in 1905.

Pi as Transcendental

In 1882 the German mathematician Ferdinand von Lindemann (1852-1939) studied pi, the ratio of the circumference of a circle to its diameter. Its value is 3.14159 . .. and so on, forever, in a nonrepeating decimal, for pi is an irrational number.

Lindemann was able to show that it was more than irrational. It was transcendental, as Hermite had  shown e to be (see 1873). Therefore, pi could not serve as a solution for any conceivable polynomial

equation, and that meant that the problem of squaring the circle by straightedge and compass in a

finite number of steps (see 1837) was impossible

1883,Alloy Steel,"['Manganese', 'Robert Abbott Hadfield', 'Hadfield']",['British'],"For three thousand years, steel (carbonized iron) had been the strongest material known for tools, structures, and weapons, but that didn’t mean it couldn’t be improved.

Attempts were made to improve the qualities of steel by adding other metals. Manganese was one of the metals tried, but it seemed to make the steel more brittle. A British metallurgist, Robert Abbott Hadfield (1858—1940), added more manganese

than others had thought advisable, however, and when the steel was 12 percent manganese, it was no longer brittle. If it was then heated to 1,000° C and quenched, it became superhard. Where ordinary steel used for railroad rails had to be replaced every nine months, rails made of manganese-steel lasted twenty-two years.

Hadfield patented his manganese-steel in 1883, and that marked the beginning of the triumph of alloy steel. Other metals were then added to steel in vary

ing quantities and mixtures —chromium, tungsten, molybdenum, vanadium, niobium, and so on—in search of alloys with new and useful properties.

A

working with electric generators, however, to get a kind of current that goes first in one direction, then in the other, alternating very rapidly, with the current intensity rising and falling like a sine wave. This is alternating current (ac).

Alternating current didn't seem as useful as direct current, but then in 1883 a Croatian electrical engineer, Nikola Tesla (1856—1943), constructed an induction motor that could make use of alternating current to do useful work.

Edison had committed himself to direct current, and he fought the use of alternating current, but he lost out eventually.

1883,Edison Effect,"['Edison', 'Edison Edison']",[],"Once Edison had invented the electric light (see 1879), he naturally endeavored to improve it. In particular, he wanted to make the filament last longer. In 1883 he sealed a metal wire into a light bulb near the hot filament. Perhaps he thought this might absorb some of the remaining air in the tube and lessen its destructive effect on the filament.

To Edison's surprise, electricity flowed from the hot filament to the cold

wire across the gap that separated them. This is called the Edison effect. Edison wrote up the effect meticulously and patented it, as a matter of course, but he could think of no use for it. This was his only purely scientific discovery, and he didn’t follow it up. The Edison effect proved the basis for the science of electronics that was eventually to come.

He perfected the process in 1883 and found he had a fiber that strongly resembled silk in its fineness and shininess. He called it rayon (from the French word for “a ray of light”"") because of its shininess. He used only partly nitrated cellulose, so rayon wasn't explosive, but it was still uncomfortably inflammable.

Rayon was the first synthetic fiber, and it was to be followed by many others.

1883,Meiosis,"['Edouard Joseph', 'Meiosis', 'Mendel']","['Flemming', 'Belgian', 'Beneden', 'Greek']","The discovery of the mechanism of cell division by Flemming (see 1882) stimulated many biologists into investigating the matter further.

The Belgian cytologist Edouard Joseph LouisMarie van Beneden (1846— 1910) found that the number of chromosomes in the cells of a particular species was always constant, though the number varied from species to species.

(It is now known that there are forty-six chromosomes in human cells.)

Furthermore, he discovered that in the formation of the sex cells (that is, the ova and spermatozoa), the division of chromosomes during one of the cell divisions was not preceded by a doubling. Each egg and sperm cell, therefore, ended with only half the usual number of chromosomes. (This halving of number was called meiosis, from a Greek word meaning “to make smaller”). Consequently, when a sperm cell entered an egg cell in the process of fertilization, the chromosomes reached their normal number for the species, half of them coming from the mother and half from the father.

Meiosis fit in perfectly

to the animals brought these cells to the spot at once.

In 1883 Metchnikoff followed up this lead and studied more complicated animals. He was able to show that the white cells in blood were also semiindependent and were capable of ingesting bacteria. The white cells flocked to the site of any infection, and what followed was a battle between bacteria and what Metchnikoff called phagocytes (Greek for “eating cells’""). When the phagocytes lost heavily, their disintegrated structures made up pus.

The white cells, Metchnikoff held, were an important factor in resistance to infection and disease. For this work, he received a share of the Nobel Prize in physiology and medicine in 1908.

The Maxim gun gave European armies a still greater advantage over native levies in Africa and Asia. One popular jingle of the time went:

characteristics, so that larger and speedier horses were obtained, sheep with more wool, cows with more milk, hens with more eggs. It must have occurred to many that similar tactics might improve the human species.

One who thought this was the British anthropologist Francis Galton (1822— 1911), a first cousin of Charles Darwin. In 1883 he coined the term eugenics (from Greek words meaning “good breeding""”) for the study of the improvement of human qualities by careful breeding.

However, eugenics is not easy to put into practice. In the first place, one can’t guide human breeding with quite the ease that one can guide the breeding of animals. Secand, we are not as sure of what we want in human beings as we are in the case of animals. Third, when Mendel’s discovery of recessive traits (see 1865) was understood, it came to be seen that it was hard to get rid of what one might consider undesirable characteristics. Fourth, the loudest supporters of eugenics were unsavory characters who wished to place it at the service of prejudice and racism.  1884

lonic Dissociation

ubstance disso

ter lowers the f point of water some

This lowering is in proportion to the quantity of the substance dissolved.

For different substances, the amount of lowering depends on the number of molecules present. If substance A has molecules only half the mass of substance B’s molecules, and if equal masses of both are dissolved in separate quantities of water, there will be twice as many molecules of the half-sized A in solution as of the full-sized B. Substance A will therefore be more effective in lowering the freezing point of water than substance B.

That goes for substances that don't conduct electric current in solution (nonelectrolytes). For substances that do conduct electric current (electroIytes), the situation is different. For instance, when sodium chloride is dissolved in water, one can calculate how many of its molecules are in solution and therefore how far the freezing point will be depressed. However, the freezing point is depressed twice as much as the calculated figure. The same is true for potassium bromide and sodium nitrate. With substances like barium chloride and sodium sulfate, the depression of the freezing point is three times what is calculated.

A Swedish chemistry student, Svante August Arrhenius (1859-1927), decided that the logical way to explain this was to suppose that sodium chloride molecules broke up into two fragments of opposite electrical charge (such fragments are called ions, a word first used by Faraday —see 1821). The ions carried the current, and since there were twice as many particles as there would have been if the molecule had remained intact, this accounted for the doubled depression of the freezing point. In the same way, barium chloride must break up into three ions, and so on.

In 1884 Arrhenius presented his theory of ionic dissociation as his Ph.D. thesis. It was not greeted with enthusiasm, for chemists had assumed for a century that atoms were featureless, indestructible, and unchanging. The thought of atoms carrying electric charges lent them features and a structure, and that was hard to accept. However, Arrhenius’s theory made sense in every other way, so he was given a passing grade—but the lowest possible one. In 1903, when key discoveries had been made concerning the atom’s structure, this same thesis obtained for Arrhenius a Nobel Prize.

4354,Sugar Structure,"['Hoff', 'Emil Hermann Fischer', 'Fischer']","['German', 'Franklin']","Though sugars had been studied throughout the nineteenth century, and though their atomic content was more or less known, the actual threedimensional arrangement of the atoms was not known. The work of van’t Hoff, ten years before, had shown the importance of the three-dimensional arrangement of atoms in a molecule and the way this could be responsible for optical activity (see 1874).

In a long series of experiments beginning in 1884, the German chemist Emil Hermann Fischer (1852—1919) isolated pure sugars and studied their structures. He showed that the best-known sugars contained six carbon atoms and could exist in sixteen varieties, depending on how the carbon bonds were arranged. Each different arrangement was reflected in the way the plane of light polarization was twisted.

Fischer showed that there were two series of sugars, mirror images of each other, which he called the D-series and the L-series. He had to pick which mirror image belonged to which method of writing the formula, and he did so arbitrarily. He had a fifty-fifty  chance of guessing correctly, and (unlike Franklin on the electric charge—see 1752), he guessed right. The natural sugars all happen to belong to the D-series. While engaged in this work, Fischer also studied a group of substances called purines, with molecules that consisted of a double ring of atoms made up of five carbons and four nitrogens. They were eventually found to make up an important part of certain key biochemical substances. For his work on sugar structure and on purines, Fischer received the Nobel Prize for chemistry in 1902.

The Incas chewed the leaves to suppress feelings of pain and weariness and so be able to endure the strains of life better. Europeans eventually discovered cocaine without understanding at first that it was strongly addictive and therefore dangerous. One of the first to study it was an Austrian physician, Sigmund Freud (1856— 1939). He did not follow it up but passed on his information to an Austrian colleague, Carl Koller (1857—

1944). Freud suggested that cocaine might be a painrelieving agent, but Koller went further and studied its uses as a local anesthetic (one that would deaden pain in a particular area of the body without producing unconsciousness).

In 1884, after having experimented on animals, Koller performed an eye operation on a patient—the first using local anesthesia. It was successful. Eventually, local anesthetics were developed that were more effective, and safer, than cocaine.

In 1884 a German-born American inventor, Ottmar Mergenthaler (1854-1899), patented a machine that, when directed by an operator at a keyboard, could set a whole line of type at one time.

It can occur in any warm-blooded animal. The microorganism that causes it can be present in the salivary glands and may be communicated by a bite. For human beings, dogs can be particularly dangerous. They become excitable and vicious (“mad dogs”) when they have the disease, and bite at the slightest cause, or for no cause at all.

Once infected, it may take quite a while for a human being to show symptoms, because the microorganism has to penetrate the nervous system, but once it is established there, death is fairly quick, almost certain, and agonizing.

Pasteur tried to treat the disease as he had treated anthrax (see 1881), by developing an attenuated and feeble preparation of the causative agent that would give immunity but not the disease. He showed that an attenuated agent could be obtained by passing a rabies infection through a variety of different species of animals until its virulence had abated.

In 1885 Pasteur made the first use of his attenuated preparation to pre a case of rabies in a boy, Joseph Meister (1878— 1940), who had been bitten by a mad dog. The treatment worked, and the boy was saved.

He also obtained pyrimidines, whose molecule re made up of a single ring of atoms, four carbons and two nitrogens

4354,Transformer,['William Stanley'],['American'],"In the battle between alternating current and direct current (see 1883), victory went to alternating current,

because it could be transformed into another current of much higher voltage and of correspondingly lower amperage (to get something, you have to give up something in the real world). While it is in this high-voltage state, the current can be transported long distances with comparatively little loss. Once it arrives at its destination, it can be reconverted into a low-voltage, high-amperage current again, in which form it can do its work best.

For these transformations from low to high voltage and back again, a device was needed that was invented in 1885 by an American electrical engineer, William Stanley (1858-1916), who was working for Westinghouse (see 1868). His transformer could shift voltage and amperage, but only with alternating current and not with direct current.

Even fairly advanced ones, built much later, took time to start, because water had to be heated and boiled first.

The coming of the internal-combustion engine, especially the Otto fourstroke engine (see 1876), offered a much better hope. What was needed now was an appropriate fuel, and eventually that turned out to be gasoline, a petroleum

fraction with smaller molecules than those of kerosene, so that it vaporized more easily and burned more readily.

The first working automobile with a gasolineburning internal-combustion engine was built in

1886,Fingerprints,['Galton'],['Galton'],"In 1885 Galton (see 1883) pointed out the individuality of fingerprints. No two people (barring identical twins) had identical fingerprints, and Galton  worked out a thoroughgoing system of classifying and identifying them.

In handling smooth surfaces, people always left sweaty, greasy fingerprints, even when these were unno-

ticeable unless the surface was appropriately powdered. Eventually, fingerprints proved a useful way of showing that a given person had been present at a given place and had han-

dled a given object. This added a new dimension to forensic medicine (from a Latin word referring to a public place such as a courtroom).

1886,Aluminum,"['Napoléon I11', 'Charles Martin Hall', 'Hall', 'Davy', 'Aluminum']","['Aluminum', 'American', 'French']","Aluminum is the most common element in the Earth's crust. It was first isolated by @rsted (see 1825), but the isolation was so difficult that it was virtually a precious metal. Napoléon I11 had his cutlery and a baby rattle for the Prince Imperial made out of aluminum, and the capstone on the Washington Monument is a slab of aluminum.

In 1886 an American student of chemistry, Charles Martin Hall (1863— 1914), heard his teacher say that anyone who discovered a cheap way of making aluminum would grow rich and famous. In his home laboratory, using homemade batteries, Hall devised a method of

preparing aluminum by the use of an electric current, as Davy had prepared sodium and potassium nearly eighty years before (see 1807). He used aluminum oxide dissolved in a molten mineral named cryolite, and into it he stuck carbon electrodes.

0Oddly enough, that same year a French metallurgist, Paul-Louis-Toussaint Héroult (1863-1914), with the same last initial and the same birth and death years, independently devised precisely the same system, which is therefore called the Hall-Héroult process.

Aluminum became cheaper almost at once, and it is now second only to steel as a structural material. A combination of

lightness and strength makes it ideal for aircraft, for instance.

1886,Germanium,"['Clemens Alexander Winkler', 'Mendeleyev']","['German', 'Germany', 'Neptune']","A German chemist, Clemens Alexander Winkler (1838-1904), analyzed a silver ore and, when he had completed his work, found that the elements he had located added up to only 93 percent of the whole. Puzzled, he searched out the remaining 7 percent and, in 1886, found a hitherto unrecognized element, which he named germanium, after Germany.

It turned out to be ekasilicon and filled the one remaining gap for which Mendeleyev had predicted a new element (see 1869). What's more, the properties  that Mendeleyev had predicted for it once again turned out to be absolutely correct. Three predictions made, three predictions fulfilled.

1886,Fluorine,"['Henri Moissan', 'Mendeleyev']",['French'],"For three-quarters of a century, chemists had known that a certain element must exist. They had even given it a name—flourine. However, it was a particularly active element, the most active one known, more active than oxygen and chlorine, and nothing seemed capable of forcing it out of combination with other elements.

A number of chemists tried to isolate it and found the matter not only difficult but dangerous, for the materials they had to work with were poisonous.

Finally, a French chemist, Henri Moissan (1852— 1907), tried. He used platinum for all his equipment, because it was one of the very few substances that fluorine would not attack and combine with instantly. If he isolated some fluorine in platinum, that fluorine would stay isolated.

He placed a solution of potassium fluoride in hydrogen fluoride in his plati-

num equipment, chilled it to —50° C to tame the fluorine a bit, and passed an electric current through it on June 26, 1886. He obtained a pale yellow gas that was the long-sought fluorine. i

For this, he obtained the Nobel Prize in chemistry in 1906 (receiving, according to report, one vote more than Mendeleyev did, which if true was an injustice, for Mendeleyev was more deserving).

In 1886 he used a perforated cathode, one with small holes, or channels, penetrating it. When he did this, he found that not only did cathode rays emerge as usual,

but radiation passed through the channels and streamed in the opposite direction.

He called the radiation Kanalstrahlen, which is German for “channel rays,” but they were usually called canal rays, by the same mistranslation that had given rise to the notion of Martian canals (see 1877).

1886,Raoult’s Law,"['Raoult', 'Arrhenius']",['French'],"The French physical chemist Frangois-Marie Raoult (1830—-1901) showed in 1886 that the partial pressure of solvent vapors in equilibrium with a solution is directly proportional to the ratio of the number of solvent molecules to solute molecules. This is called Raoult's law.

To the nonchemist, the law may seem unclear, but it provided chemists with a new way of calculating the molecular weight of dissolved substances. It also showed that the freezing point was depressed, and the boiling point elevated, in proportion to the number of particles present in a given volume of solution. Arrhenius had assumed this when he had worked out his theory of ionic dissociation two years earlier (see 1884).

1887,Nitrogen,"['Hermann Hellriegel', 'Edward Williams Morley']","['German', 'American']","e o Fixation Plants must have nitrogen atoms to build their tissues, and they get them from nitrates in the soil. There are enormous amounts of nitrogen in the atmosphere, but nitrogen itself is not active, and it is not easy to force it

into combination with other substances.

The German chemist Hermann Hellriegel (18311895) discovered in 1886 that some leguminous plants (peas, beans, and related species) had root nodules that contained nitrogen-fixing bacteria (that is, bacteria that could affix nitrogen to other kinds of el-

ements, eventually forming nitrates). Since there is always a danger that plants will consume the nitrates in soil, causing it to decline in fertility, it was useful to know that the planting of leguminous plants would restore the fertility of the soil —at least with respect to nitrogen.

MichelsonMorley Experiment

Michelson, who had hoped to determine the Earth's speed of motion through the stationary ether (see 1881), continued to improve the delicacy of his procedure and of his instruments, and to repeat the experiment. Finally, in 1887, with the help of a colleague, the American chemist Edward Williams Morley (1838-1923), Mi-

chelson ran a definitive experiment and, once again, found no interference fringes.

There had to be an explanation, Either the Earth was motionless with respect to the ether, or the Earth dragged the ether with it, or something. All possible explanations seemed highly unlikely, and for nearly a quarter of a century, the world of science was completely puzzled. It took a scientific revolution to explain the matter, so that the

Michelson-Morley experiment is perhaps the most important “failure” in the history of science.

1887,Photoelectric Effect,"['Heinrich Rudolph Hertz', 'Hertz']","['German', 'Maxwell']","The German physicist Heinrich Rudolph Hertz (1857— 1894) was interested in Maxwell's equations (see 1865). As part of his investigation of electromagnetic effects in the light of those equations, he set up an electrical circuit that oscil lated. It surged alternately, first into one, then into the other of two metal balls separated by an air gap. Each time the potential reached a peak in one direction or the other, it sent a spark across the gap.

In the course of these experiments, Hertz noted that when ultraviolet light shone on the negative terminal of the gap, the one from which the spark issued, the spark was more easily elicited. This did not seem to have anything to do with what he was trying to observe, so he noted the matter but did not follow it up.

This was the first observation of the effect of light on electrical phenomena, however. This photoelectric effect turned out to be extremely important.

eled, the more important air resistance would be, The Austrian physicist Ernst Mach (1838-1916) studied the conditions that occurred when a solid object and air were in rapid motion relative to each other.

The natural rate at which air molecules can move is the speed of sound through air. When an object moves through air at higher speeds, the air molecules can no longer move aside naturally but must be shoved aside (so to speak) faster than they want to go. This produces new conditions, which Mach studied.

For instance, fasterthan-sound motion compresses air and sets up a bunching of sound waves that then expands to produce a sudden clap, Thunder is the best example of such a sonic boom, with the heat of lightning expanding the air at greater than the speed of sound. Another example of a senic boom is the crack of a bullwhip.

A speed equal to that of

sound is now called Mach 1

1888,Rubber Tire,"['John Boyd Dunlop', 'Dunlop']",['British'],"Since wheeled transportation had been invented five thousand years before, wheels had had wooden or metal rims. These were noisy and offered no spring, so that travel on carts and wagons was a jolting affair,

In 1887 a British inventor, John Boyd Dunlop (1840-1921), decided to rim the wheels of his son's tricycle with a rubber tire (and patented the notion the following year). Rubber, though soft, actually wears better than wood or iron does. What's more, Dunlop made it a pneumatic tire: what went round the rim was an airfilled tube, which was covered by a tire with a rubber tread.

This gave a vehicle spring and cut down the noise tremendously, so that tires were soon used for automobiles and other vehicles as well.

1888,Radio Waves,"['Hertz', 'Hertz Sure', 'Hertz Hertz', 'Hertz Le Chatelier', 'Again', 'Gibbs']","['Hertzian', 'French', 'Guldberg', 'Waage']","When Hertz was performing the experiments that gave him the first glimpse of a photoelectric effect (see 1887), he expected that the oscillating current he was working with would produce an electromagnetic wave. Each oscillation should produce a wave, and the wave should be very long. After all, since light travels at a bit over 186,000 miles per second, a wavelength formed in an oscillation of a mere hundred-thousandth of a second will still be nearly 2 miles long. In 1888, he actually observed such waves. Hertz used, as a device for detecting the possible presence of such long-wave radiation, a simple loop of wire, with a small air gap at one point. Just as the current in his first coil gave rise to radiation, so the radiation produced ought to give rise to a current in the

second coil, Sure enough, Hertz was able to detect small sparks jumping across the gap in his detector coil.

By moving his detector coil to various parts of the room, Hertz could tell the shape of the waves by the intensity of the spark formation and could calculate a wavelength of 2.2 feet. This is a million times the size of a wavelength of ordinary light. He also managed to show that the waves were electromagnetic in nature. At first these long-wave radiations were called Hertzian waves, but later the name radio waves came into use instead.

In this way, Hertz verified the usefulness of Maxwell’s equations and showed that light was only a tiny section of the electromagnetic spectrum.

A Le Chatelier's Principle

The French chemist HenriLouis Le Chatelier (1850— 1936) stated a rule in 1888 that became known as Le Chatelier’s principle. The rule is this: Every change in one of the factors of an equilibrium brings about a rearrangement of the system in such a direction as to minimize the original change.

If a system in equilibrium is placed under increased pressure, for instance, the system rearranges itself to take up less room, so as to minimize the increased pressure. Again, if the temperature is raised, the system undergoes a change that absorbs some of the additional heat, so as to minimize the rise in temperature.

This very general statement included the law of  mass action of Guldberg and Waage (see 1867) and fit in well with Gibbs’s chemical thermodynamics (see 1876). It also worked as a guidepost to direct scientists in how best to bring about desired changes in a system.

The American inventor George Eastman (1854 1932) simplihed the process. He substituted a flexible film for the large and inflexible piece of glass on which photographic emulsion was spread and dried With a film that could be rolled compactly, cameras could be made much smaller.

In 1888 Eastman developed a camera that weighed only about 2 pounds. He called it the Kodak, a meaningless name but one Eastman thought would be catchy and easily remembered. It had the film rolled up in it, and all the owner had to do was to point the camera, press a button, then send the camera to Rochester. Eventually, the photograph and the newly loaded camera were sent back. The Kodak slogan was “You press the button—we do the rest.”

There were many improvements to come, but the Kodak started the process that allowed anyone and everyone to take photo-

graphs. The camera entered the home and began to make itself universal

Moreover, of all the parts of a human body, the brain and nervous system are, or should be, the most interesting, since it is they that make us human. Waldeyer-Hartz (see 1888) was the first to maintain that the nervous system was built out of separate cells and their delicate extensions. The delicate extensions, he pointed out, approached each other closely but did not actually meet, much less join, so that the nerve cells remained separate. He called the nerve cells neurons, and his thesis that the nervous em is composed of sepa-

rate neurans is the neuron theory.

An Italian histologist, Camillo Golgi (1843 or 1844-1926), fifteen years before, had devised a system of staining with silver compounds that brought out the structure of neurons in fine detail. Using this stain he could demonstrate that Waldeyer-Hartz's views were correct. He could show that fine processes did indeed issue from the neurons and that from one neuron approached but did not touch those of neighboring neurons. The tiny gaps between one neuron and the next are called synapses (oddly enough, from a Greek word meaning “union,” which they appeared to be at a casual glance but were not in actuality).

A Spanish histologist,

Santiago Ramoén y Cajal (1852-1934), improved on Golgi’s stain, and by 1889 had worked out the cellular structure of the brain and spinal cord in detail, firmly establishing the neuron theory

For their work on the neuron theory, Golgi and Ramon y Cajal shared the Nobel Prize in medicine and physiology in 1906.

In 1889 an Italian mathematician, Giuseppe Peano (1858-1932), published A Logical Exposition of the Principles of Georne

1889,Energy of Activation,['Arrhenius'],[],"It was the experience of early humans that fires were hard to start but that once started, they kept right on going with no further trouble as long as they were fed fuel.

This is also true of many chemical reactions. Nevertheless, a reaction that ordinarily yields energy when it proceeds will not take place spontaneously until energy is added to it. The reaction has to be activated, by breaking molecules apart, perhaps, so that individual atoms or molecular fragments can react with each other more freely. The energy required is called the energy of activation.

Once the reaction starts, it yields energy that can be used to activate neighboring parts of the initial substance. Thus, when you heat a hydrogen and oxyeen mixture and a small amount begins to react, the

energy it produces will cause a wave of reaction to spread to other parts of the mixture so rapidly that it explodes. This is a chain reaction, since each step leads to the next, as each link in a chain leads to the next.

Arrhenius (see 1884) analyzed the energy activation concept systematically in 1889 and brought about new understanding of chemical reactions, of chain reactions, and of explosions.

However, they could be detected optically only if they were far enough apart to be seen as separate objects in a telescope. What if the pair were so far away or so close together (or both) that they could not be distinguished?

In 1889 the American astronomer Edward Charles Pickering (1846~ 1919) noted that Mizar, the middle star in the handle of the Big Dipper, had dark lines that divided in two. They moved apart, then came together, joined, and moved apart again in the opposite direction. He sus-

pected that what he was viewing was a binary star with components so close together they could not be seen separately.

However, as they circled each other in the plane of his line of sight, one was advancing and the other receding, so that the former showed a violet shift and the latter a red shift. After they had swung about each other, the one that was receding began to advance and vice versa.

His assistant, Antonia Caetana Maury (1866— 1952), worked out the period of this spectroscopic binary—104 days—and then went on to discover a second such star, Beta Aurigae, with a period of 4 days.

The following year, a German astronomer, Hermann Karl Vogel (1842— 1907), independently discovered spectroscopic binaries.

Mercury was a smaller world than Mars and farther away. It was often lost in the Sun's glare, and when it could be seen best, only a crescent  phase was visible. Nevertheless, Schiaparelli did make out some markings, and since he always saw the same markings when the planet was in a particular position, he concluded, in 1889, that Mercury always presented the same side to the Sun.

Since Mercury was close enough to the Sun for tidal influences to produce this effect, Schiaparelli's suggestion was accepted without serious question for the next three-quarters of a century.

1889,Cordite,"['Frederick Augustus Abel', 'James Dewar', 'Cordite']","['English', 'British']","For four centuries, gunpowder had ruled the battlefield. It produced a smoke and a stench, however, and battlefields hidden under a thickening pall of gunpowder smoke made adequate generalship difficult.

An English chemist, Frederick Augustus Abel (1827—1902), worked on the problem of developing explosives that would not produce smoke. In 1889, with the help of another British chemist, James Dewar (1842-1923), he developed cordite.

Cordite was a mixture of nitroglycerine (see 1847) and nitrocellulose (see 1834) to which some petroleum jelly was added. The resulting gelatinous mass could be squirted out into cords (hence the name of the material), which after careful drying could be measured out in precise quantities.

The use of cordite (and other such smokeless explosives) freed the battlefield from its cloud. While it might seem small comfort that the scene of carnage and atrocity could be seen clearly, it was important militarily, for it allowed generals to survey a battle’s progress and better avoid the casualties that come about when soldiers blunder about uselessly.

1890,Motion Pictures,['Edison'],['Eastman'],"Once photography had been invented (see 1839), it seemed natural to use it to simulate motion. If photographs are taken of a moving object in quick succession and flashed before the eyes rapidly, the eye retains an image of each for a brief while, so

that all the flashings melt together and are not seen as separate images. Instead, the object photographed seems to move.

Such devices were constructed, but generally they showed very brief movements that might be repeated over and over again, Primitive as such devices were, they amused the audience.

Edison thought of a way to extend such illusions and perpetuate them for a considerable length of time, He used a strip of film, of the type brought into production by Eastman (see 1888), and took a series of closely spaced photographs of a moving object, which he placed along its length. The film could then be moved by means of perforations along the sides over sprocket wheels, which could push the film in front of a flashing light at a carefully regulated speed.

In effect, Edison had invented motion pictures. With a steady stream of improvements, they developed into a giant industry as indispensable to modern life as the automobile.

1890,Antitoxin,"['Emil Adolf', 'Behring']","['Greek', 'German']","A microorganism itself may not be the immediate cause of a disease, but some substance it produces may be (a toxin, from a Greek word for “poison”). An organism stricken with the disease then produces a substance (an antitoxin) capable of neutralizing the toxin. If the organism recovers, the antitoxin present in its bloadstream confers immunity to the disease thereafter.

A German bacteriolot, Emil Adolf von Behring (1854-1917), decided in 1890 that it might be possible to produce an immunity against tetanus, in an animal, by injecting into it graded doses of blood serum from another animal suffering from tetanus. Enough of the serum would be given to induce anti-

toxin formation, but not enough to cause it to die.

It was found that the animal thus immunized could then be used as a source of antitoxin that could confer at least temporary immunity on still another animal, or in a human being.

Behring tried this also in the case of diphtheria, a disease that was in those days common among children and often fatal. The diphtheria antitoxin, once marketed, not only conferred a certain immunity, but helped defeat the discase even after it had established itself.

For this work, Behring received the Nobel Prize for physiology and medicine in 1901, the first year in which Nobel Prizes were awarded.

He | could not easily reach Africa, but the Indonesian islands were Dutch territory, and Dubois, who was serving in the army, managed  to wangle an assignment to Java.

He had incredible luck, for in 1890, not long after reaching Java, he discovered a skullcap, a thighbone, and two teeth of what was undoubtedly the most primitive humanlike organism (hominid) that had yet been found. It was clear, for instance, that the brain was only three-fifths the size of a modern human being's.

Dubois called the organism Pithecanthropus erectus (erect ape-human), since the thighbone was sufficiently human to signify that the hominid had walked erect as we do. The existence of this hominid was a powerful argument in favor of evolution.

By 1891, 322 asteroids had been discovered and their orbits calculated.

Each one, however, had been discovered by eye; an object would be seen that looked like a rather dim star but would be shifting position against the starry background. If it moved at a certain rate, it was almost certainly an asteroid.

In 1891 it occurred to a German astronomer, Maximilian Franz Joseph Cornelius Wolf (1863—1932), to make the discoveries by photography. If a telescope is set to turning in time with the movement of the vault of the sky (a movement that arises because of the rotational motion of the Earth), then all the stars in

the telescopic view will show up on the film as sharp points. An asteroid, however, will move with respect to the stars and so will show up as a small dash. The object responsible for the dash can then be put under observation and its orbit eventually calculated.

In this fashion, Wolf discovered the 323rd asteroid, which he named Brucia, and went on to discover others. In the course of his life, he discovered 500 asteroids. Nowadays, the orbits of nearly 2000 asteroids are known, and it is estimated that there may be as many as 100,000 asteroids that are at least a mile across.

1891,Gravitational and Inertial Mass,"['Newton', 'George Johnstone Stoney']","['Newton', 'Hungarian', 'Roland', 'Irish']","Newton had defined mass

in terms of the amount of

acceleration produced in a body through the application of a force of a given

magnitude. This is called the inertial mass, because the greater the mass of a body, the less acceleration a given force produces and the greater the inertia (the resistance to a change in velocity).

Newton also found that the intensity of an object’s gravitational field at a given distance depended upon its mass. That is the gravitational mass.

These two kinds of mass were determined by two entirely different kinds of observations and would seem to have no necessary connection, yet the mass determined by inertial effects always seemed to be the same as the mass determined by gravitational effects.

A Hungarian physicist, Roland E6tvos (1848— 1919), saw that if the gravitational mass and the inertial mass were truly identical, then objects in a given gravitational field would always drop (in a vacuum) at the same rate, regardless of mass. He  made particularly delicate measurements in 1891 and found that objects of different mass fell at the same rate within five parts per billion. If there was a difference between the two kinds of mass, it was extremely tiny.

This measurement turned out to be very important later in the development of a new and better way of looking at gravity.

Fundamental Unit of Electricity Arrhenius’s theory of ionic dissociation (see 1884) made it look as though atoms or groups of atoms could carry electric charges. What's more, it looked as though atoms or atom groups would carry charges of different sizes that were related to each other in ratios of exact whole numbers.

An Irish physicist, George Johnstone Stoney (1826-1911), suggested that electricity existed in fundamental particles, as matter did, and that all these particles carried the same electric charge. A particular atom or atom group would then carry one of these particles, or two or three, and that was why the ratios would be in whole numbers.

He suggested in 1891 that the fundamental particle be called an electron. This didn't seem to make much of an impression at the time, but four years later it was to come into its own.

1891,Carborundum,"['Graphite', 'Le Chatelier', 'Edward Goodrich Acheson', 'Silicon', 'Silicon Acheson']",['American'],"People from the earliest times have needed abrasives; that is, hard substances that can grind down softer substances, removing unevennesses and imparting a smooth polish to the surface. The diamond is made up of carbon atoms symmetrically placed in tetrahedral patterns, and they are very close to each other as well since the carbon atoms are so small. Therefore, the atoms in diamonds cling together more tightly than in any other substance, so that diamond is by far the hardest material known. Perfect diamonds are too beautiful to use for anything other than show and ornamentation, but imperfect diamonds, or diamond dust, can be used as abrasives. Even imperfect diamonds, however, are in short supply.

Graphite is also made up of carbon atoms, but in a different, looser arrangement. It is so far from being an abrasive that it can be used as a lubricant. By Le

Chatelier’s principle (see 1888), however, if graphite is placed under great pressure, its atoms should take up a more compact arrangement and it should become diamond (as it does under great pressure deep underground).

Various scientists had tried to supply the necessary pressure, but up to this time none had succeeded. An American inventor, Edward Goodrich Acheson (1856—1931), made the attempt, too.

He did not succeed in forming diamond either, but in 1891, he found that when he heated carbon strongly with clay, he obtained what he eventually found to be a compound of silicon and carbon, or silicon carbide. Silicon is much like carbon in its properties, so that the atoms of silicon carbide have a diamond arrangement with a silicon atom taking the place of every other carbon. Silicon is a larger atom and doesn’t hold together quite as tightly as carbon atoms do, so silicon carbide is not quite as hard as diamond. Still, it was harder than anything else known at the time, and much cheaper than diamond.

Acheson called the new compound carbortndunt, and it became extremely useful in industry as an abrasive.

In the interval since, no other Jovian satellite had been discovered, even though Saturn, a smaller and more distant planet, was known to have

eight satellites by this time.

The American astronomer Edward Emerson Barnard (1857—1923) reasoned, as Hall had in connection with Mars (see 1877), that a fifth satellite, if it existed, would have to be small and close to Jupiter. He searched the neighborhood of Jupiter and in 1892 spotted a satellite only 112,500 miles from Jupiter's center and only 68,000 miles above Jupiter’s cloud surface. We now know it to be only 125 miles in diameter.

It was variously called Barnard's satellite and Jupiter V (because it was the fifth satellite to be discovered), but the French as-

tronomer Camille Flammarion (1842—1925) suggested it be named Amalthea, after the goat (or nymph) that served as wetnurse for Jupiter (Zeus) during the god's infancy.

Amalthea was the twenty-first satellite to be discovered and the last to be discovered without photography.

In 1892 he was able to observe and measure the pressure exerted by light.

1892,Fitzgerald Contraction,['George Francis'],[],"For five years the negative results of the MichelsonMorley experiment had puzzled physicists. The irish physicist George Francis FitzGerald (1851-1901) offered an explanation in 1892.

He suggested that distances contracted with speed. If a light source sped along toward point A at a certain velocity, then the light it emitted in the direction of that velocity had to cover a slightly smaller distance to reach point A than light emitted in other directions. The faster the source moved, the shorter the distance light would have to travel to reach a point that would seem to be a fixed distance away to a motionless observer. That change in distance would keep the light moving in different directions in phase,  so that there would be no interference fringes when it rejoined. Furthermore, if the source traveled at the speed of light, then the distance from the source to any other point in the direction of travel would be zero, because a speed faster than light was impossible. FitzGerald derived a simple equation, involving the ratio of the speed of the light source to the speed of light, that would reduce distances in the direction of travel just enough to produce a negative result in the Michelson-Morley experiment. This was called the FitzGerald contraction, but it seemed ad hoc (that is, an explanation made up just to account for a partic-

ular observation and nothing else). It would take thirteen more years for a more fundamental solution to be found.

1893,Dewar Flask,['Dewar'],"['Heat', 'Dewar']","Heat can be transported from one place to another in three ways: by conduction (travel through matter), convection (carriage by the movement of matter itself, as by air and water currents), and radiation.

Of these, only radiation can transport heat in a vacuum. Realizing this, Dewar (see 1889) in 1892 constructed a double-walled flask with a vacuum between the walls. He was interested in low-

temperature work, and very cold liquids such as liquid nitrogen, if kept in such a double-walled flask, would gain heat from the outside only slowly. Dewar cut down on transport by radiation even more by covering the interior of the double walls with a mirror surface so that radiation would be reflected rather than absorbed.

These were called Dewar flasks and proved indispensable to low-temperature work. They also entered the commercial home market, where they sold as thermos bottles for keeping cold drinks cold and hot drinks hot.

1893,Psychoanalysis,['Breuer'],['Freud'],"Breuer had started to use hypnotism in the treatment of mental diseases such as hysteria (see 1880). The method had later been taken up by Freud (see

1884), but he eventually abandoned hypnotism for free association, allowing the patient to talk randomly and at will with a minimum of guidance. In this fashion, the patient was gradually put off

guard, and matters came to be revealed that in ordinary circumstances would have been kept secret from the patient’s conscious mind

The advantage of this method over hypnotism

was that the patient was aware of what was going on at all times and did not have to be informed afterward of what had been said.

In 1893 Freud and Breuer published The Psychic Mechanism of Hysterical Phenomena. This is considered to have laid the foundations of the medical technique of psychoanalysis.

Smith went on to show that the parasite was spread from infected animals to healthy ones by blood-sucking ticks. This was the first definite indication that disease could be spread by an arthropod. Ticks were among the arachnids (the spider family), but it would soon be shown that blood-sucking insects could also be responsible for the spread of disease.

1893,Wavelengths and Temperature,"['Wilhelm Wien', 'Stefan', 'Wien']",['German'],"At any temperature above absolute zero, objects give off electromagnetic radiation. In general, very long wavelengths are rare, as are very short wavelengths. Somewhere in between there is a peak wavelength, which is radiated to a greater extent than any other.

The German physicist Wilhelm Wien (1864-1928) demonstrated this by actually measuring the wavelengths. In 1893 he was able to show that the peak wavelength varies inversely with absolute temperature. As the temperature rises, not only does the total amount of radiation increase, in line with Stefan's finding (see 1879), but the peak wavelength decreases.

Thus, warm bodies radiate chiefly in the infrared, of which we are unaware except as a feeling of warmth. As temperature goes up, the peak slides toward the visible red, and eventually enough red is produced to give the body a deep red glow. It is then “red-hot.” With further temperature rise, the red brightens, grows orange, yellowish, and then white,

by which time the peak is in the yellow and all the wavelengths of light are well represented, as in the case of the Sun.

Some stars are so hot that the peak wavelength is in the ultraviolet. Such stars gleam with an intense blue-white light.

For his work on radiation, Wien received the Nobel Prize in physics in 1911.

This made it possible to design alternating current equipment with increased efficiency. Steinmetz’s mathematics spread among the electrical engineering profession and completed the victory of alternating current over direct current. (The house current we draw on whenever we plug an electrical device into a wall socket is invariably alternating current.)  Arctic Ocean

He designed a strong ship that would be lifted, rather than crushed, when the ocean about it froze. He

named the ship Fram (Forward) and set sail in 1893 with thirteen men aboard. His idea was to let himself be frozen in by the sea ice and carried along with it in its slow swirl about the Arctic Ocean, perhaps reaching the North Pole itself.

The fact that so many atomic weights were not multiples of hydrogen’s seemed to disprove Prout’s hypothesis.

Twelve years before, for instance, the British physicist John William Strutt, Lord Rayleigh (1842-1919), had shown

that the atomic weight of oxygen, although usually considered to be 16 times the atomic weight of hydrogen, is actually 15.882 times the atomic weight of hydrogen.

Rayleigh went on to measure the atomic weight of nitrogen and then encountered a puzzle. Whereas oxygen always had the same atomic weight no matter how it was prepared, nitrogen did not. Nitrogen prepared from the atmosphere consistently showed a slightly higher atomic weight than

nitrogen prepared from a variety of nitrogen-containing compounds. Rayleigh could not find a suitable explanation for this and wrote a letter to the journal Nature, asking for suggestions. The British chemist William Ramsay (1852-1916) rose to the challenge. He remembered having read that Cavendish (see 1766) had tried to combine the nitrogen of air with oxygen and had found that a small bubble of remained behind, which would simply not ¢ with oxygen. C

Ramsay repeated the

experiment, and he too found himself with a small bubble of gas left over. He had spectroscopic techniques, however, which Cavendish had not had. Ramsay heated the bubble of gas, studied the spectral

lines it emitted, and found them to be in positions that fitted no known element. Clearly here was a hitherto-unknown gaseous element, which made up about 1 percent of the atmosphere. It was completely inert and would not react with any substance. It was also denser than nitrogen. The presence of this new gas as an impurity in the nitrogen obtained from air gave the nitrogen an abnor-

mally high atomic weight, whereas nitrogen obtained from chemicals without any admixture of this impurity gave the true atomic weight.

The discovery was announced on August 13, 1894, and the new gas was named argon, [rom the Greek word for “inert.” As a result, Rayleigh received the Nobel Prize in physics and Ramsay the Nobel Prize in chemistry in 1904.

The Early 20th Century (1895—1945)

Discoveries made and theories formulated at the turn of the century set off a sequence of research that challenged existing ideas from the structure of the atom to the structure of the

universe. Investigations on the subatomic level began in the late 1890s with the discovery of X rays by Wilhelm Conrad Roentgen and radioactivity by Marie and Pierre Curie. In 1900 Max

Planck opened the era of modern physics with his quantum theory, which stated that energy was given off not continuously but in discrete pieces he called quanta. The year  1905 belonged to Albert Einstein. Working on the speed of light, he deduced his special theory of relativity, which described the effect of velocity on mass and time-flow. The special relativity theory led to the idea that mass is a highly concentrated form of energy. In 1916 Einstein extended this theory to systems moving relative to each other, thus creating the general theory of relativity. Einstein’s two relativity theories and the discipline of quantum mechanics, invented in 1926, form the theoretical foundation of twentieth-century physics. The first humanly engineered nuclear reaction occurred in 1919, when Ernest Rutherford converted one type of atom into another by subatomic bombardment. It wasn't until 1939, after scientists learned that the uranium nucleus could be broken in two (nuclear fission), that Leo Szilard discerned how to create a more powerful nuclear chain reaction and thus the nuclear bomb. In

July 1945, scientists exploded the first nuclear fission bomb and changed the course of global war and politics. The new theories in physics and improvements in telescopes gave rise to dramatic findings about the makeup of the Universe. In 1918 Harlow Shapley showed that our Solar System is nowhere near the center of the Milky Way Galaxy, as had been supposed. Five years later Edwin Powell Hubble demonstrated that the size of the Universe was far greater than had been thought. Basing his theorizing on equations that were part of Einstein's general theory of relativity, Willem de Sitter claimed in 1917 that the Universe was expanding. In 1927 GeorgesHenri Lemaitre ran this theory backward to the beginning of time, when what he called the cosmic egg exploded and started the expanding Universe; in honor of that initial explosion, Lemaitre's idea is called the big bang theory. Advances in medicine began

to grow exponentially. Researchers determined the means by which many diseases were spread, among them malaria, yellow fever, and typhus, and a treatment for syphilis was discovered. The discovery in 1935 that the compound sulfanilamide had antibacterial properties led to the synthesis of the sulfa drugs. [n 1939 the powerful antibacterial agent penicillin was isolated. Among a host of technological advances, the invention of antennas in 1895 made communication via radio waves possible for the first time, clearing the way for Guglielmo Marconi's first sending of wireless telegraph signals from England to Newfoundland in 1901. A continuous signal that replicated the irregular sound waves of speech and music was made possible in 1906 with the introduction of amplitude modulation. When the superheterodyne receiver was devised in 1916, radios could be operated by anyone and came into wide popular use.

X Rays

Work on cathode rays by Goldstein (see 1876) and by

Crookes (see 1861) had

come to interest a number of physicists in the subject. One of them was a German

physicist, Wilhelm Conrad Réntgen (1845—1923), who was particularly interested in the ability of cathode

rays to make materials fluoresce.

He placed certain chemicals, known to fluoresce easily, inside a cathode ray tube, surrounded it by dark paper, and darkened the room to observe the pale fluorescence that would result.

On November 5, 1895, he set his cathode-ray tube to working, and in the dimness, a flash of light that did not come from the tube caught his eye. A sheet of paper coated with barium platinocyanide (one of the chemicals he was planning to use) was glowing. The glow ceased when the cathode-ray tube was turned off. The coated paper glowed even in the next room once the cathode-ray tube was turned on.

Radiation was clearly emerging from the tube when the cathode rays were streaming, and was penetrating matter to some extent. Rontgen didn't know what the radiation might be, so he referred to it as X rays, x being the usual symbol for an unknown quantity in mathematics. He published his findings on December 18, 1895.

The news of these X rays roused the world of physics to a furor not seen since @rsted had discovered electromagnetism (see 1820). So much work was

done, and so many revolutionary findings were made (most of them as a direct result of Réntgen's finding) that Rontgen is often viewed as having set off a second Scientific Revolution, as Copernicus had set off the first (see 1543).

For this work, Réntgen received the Nobel Prize in physics (the first one) in 1901.

1895,Cathode Ray Particles,"['Crooke', 'Hertz', 'Hertz Philipp Eduard Anton Lenard', 'Lenard']","['German', 'French']","There were still some who thought that cathode rays were a wave form and doubted Crooke's observation that they carried electric charges.

Hertz, the discoverer of radio waves (see 1888), had found that cathode rays could pass through thin sheets of metal, and this seemed to favor their being a wave form. In 1892 one of Hertz's assistants, the German physicist Philipp Eduard Anton Lenard (1862— 1947), devised a cathode ray tube with a thin aluminum “window” through which cathode rays could emerge into open air. Lenard studied these open-air cathode rays and received a Nobel Prize in physics in 1905 as a result. He, too, thought cathode rays to be waves.

In 1895, however, a French physicist, Jean-Baptiste Perrin (1870-1942), showed that when cathode rays were made to impinge upon a cylinder, the cylinder gradually gained a large negative charge. That finally settled the matter. Cathode rays were streams of negatively charged particles, and no one has doubted it since.

The Dutch physicist Hendrik Antoon Lorentz (1853—1928) came to the same conclusions that FitzGerald had come to concerning the shortening of distance with speed (see 1892) but went farther. It seemed to Lorentz that mass would have to increase with velocity and do so at a steadily increasing rate. At a speed of 160,000 miles per second, the mass of any object should have doubled, and at the speed of light (a little over 186,000 miles per second), it should become infinite. This idea made the speed of light appear to be an absolute maximum. As a result of Lorentz's work,  physicists often speak of the Lorentz-FitzGerald contraction.

Helium on Earth

The time had passed when a new element could be discovered and then treated as though it existed all by itself. Mendeleyev with his periodic table (see 1869) had shown that elements existed in families.

Argon, discovered the year before by Rayleigh and Ramsay (see 1894), did not fit in with any existing family, but it seemed to be in the neighborhood of chlorine and potassium as far as its atomic weight was concerned. Since the periodic table was based largely on valence (see 1852), it made sense to put argon between chlorine and potassium. Chlorine and potassium each had a valence of 1, and since argon formed no combinations with other atoms at all, it had to have a valence of 0. The valence progression of 1,0, 1 made sense, and argon would be the first member of a new family of elements of 0 valence.

In that case, where were the others? Ramsay made it his business to look for them. In 1895 he learned that in America, samples of a gas taken for nitrogen had been obtained

from a uranium mineral. That looked hopeful, for the 0-valence gases could be mistaken for the rather inert nitrogen but for no other gas.

Ramsay repeated the work with a uranium mineral and got a gas that resembled nitrogen in its inertness. He tested the gas spectroscopically, however, and it did not produce the spectral lines of nitrogen. Instead it produced the spectral lines that Ramsay recognized as those detected by Janssen in sunlight (see 1868).

Janssen's solar element had been named helium, and now Ramsay had identified it on Earth, and found that it would lie between hydrogen and lithium in the periodic table. As to what helium might be doing in the uranium mineral, that was a puzzle, but the answer was not long in coming.

netism of iron disappeared. This happens to be 770° C.

If one could use such radiation for the purpose, one could do away with total dependence on telegraph wires and cables. Indeed, the British call communications by radio waves wireless telegraphy or for short wireless. Americans call it radiorelegraphy or for short radio.

Of course, to make such communication possible, one needs a far better detector than the simple loop Hertz used. In 1890 a French physicist, EdouardEugeéne Branly (1844 1940), invented a detector that consisted of a container of loosely packed metal filings. It ordinarily conducted little current, but it conducted quite a bit when radio waves fell upon

20L

it. Using this detector, Branly could detect radio waves 150 yards from the source.

The British physicist Oliver Joseph Lodge (18511940) improved the device in 1894, called it a coherer, and used it to detect radio waves half a mile from the source. He also sent out the radio waves in dots and dashes so that he could

transmit and pick up a message in Morse code.

In 1895 two men made a particularly crucial discovery. They found that a long vertical wire attached to the source, and another attached to the receiver, made the signals much stronger and easier to detect. The long wires were called antennas, because they seemed to resemble

the long feelers that insects wear on their heads.

One of the discoverers was a Russian physicist, Aleksandr Stepanovich Popov (1859-1905), the other an Italian electrical engineer, Guglielmo Marconi (1874—1937). It was these antennas that really made radio communication possible.

1896,Uranium Radiations,"['Becquerel', 'Becquerel Becquerel']","['Rontgen', 'French']","The discovery of X rays by Rontgen (see 1895) fasci-

nated a French physicist, Antoine-Henri Becquerel (1852—-1908), who had been working on fluorescent substances as his father had before him. He wondered if

perhaps the radiation given off by fluorescent substances might include X rays.

A fluorescent substance both he and his father had  been interested in was potassium uranyl sulfate. In February 1896 Becquerel wrapped photographic film in black paper and put it in sunlight with a crystal of potassium uranyl sulfate upon it. He reasoned that sunlight would make the crystal fluoresce, and any X rays it produced would penetrate the black paper (as ordinary light would not) and fog the photographic plate.

Sure enough the plate was fogged and Becquerel decided that fluorescence did produce X rays. But then came a series of cloudy days and Becquerel could not continue his experiments. He had a fresh plate neatly wrapped in the drawer with a crystal resting upon it, but there was no sunlight to expose it to. Finally, unable to bear doing nothing, he developed the film anyway, just to make sure that nothing happened in the absence of sunlight.

To his amazement, the film was strongly fogged. Whatever radiation was passing through the paper did not depend on either sunlight or fluorescence.

For this discovery, Becquerel received a share of the Nobel Prize in physics in 1903 and rightly so, for it had enormous conse-

quences.

1896,Dietary Deficiency Diseases,"['Christiaan Eijkman', 'Eijkman', 'Eijkman Eijkman', 'Eijkman Lind']","['Dutch', 'Pasteur']","People in the Dutch East Indies commonly suffered from beriberi, which produced weakness and death. Naturally it was assumed to be a germ disease, since Pasteur (see 1862) and others had been so successful at combating disease on that assumption. However, no one could find the

germ that caused the disease.

A Dutch physician, Christiaan Eijkman (1858— 1930), who had gone to the East Indies to study the disease, was nonplussed. But then an ailment broke out in 1896 among the chickens being used at the laboratory for bacteriological researches. The chicken polyneuritis showed symptoms similar to beriberi, and Eijkman was busily studying the disease and checking on its contagiousness—when it suddenly disappeared and all the chickens got well.

Eijkman investigated and found that during the period when the chickens had had the disease, they had been feeding on rice ordinarily meant for the human patients. The disease disappeared when a new cook put them back on

commiercial chicken feed. Eijkman found he could produce the chicken disease at will when he fed the chickens polished rice. By feeding them unpolished rice, he cured them.

Eijkman was the first to correct a specific disease by diet since Lind had connected citrus fruits and scurvy (see 1747). Although Eijkman missed the point at first, it became clear that beriberi was a dietary deficiency disease. It was caused by the absence of some substance (present in the hulls of unpolished rice and not present in polished rice from which the hulls had been removed) that seemed necessary to health in small traces.

For this discovery, Eijkman received a share of the Nobel Prize in physiology and medicine in 1929.

charge that was oscillating and therefore producing it?

Arrhenius had maintained that atoms or groups of atoms could carry electric charges (see 1884), and Lorentz (see 1895) had wondered if it might be electric charges within the atom that did the oscillating. If that were the case, then placing a light source under the influence of a strong magnetic field ought to affect the oscillating charges and introduce changes in the spectral lines.

Lorentz had a student, the Dutch physicist Pieter Zeeman (1865-1943), who undertook the experiment, and indeed, the magnetic field split the spectral lines into three components. This Zeeman effect could be used to study the fine details of atomic structure and to yield information on the structure of stars as well.

In 1896 a German chemist, Eduard Buchner (1860-1917), wondered if the enzymes in yeast would work if they were extracted from the living cell.

To do this, he ground up yeast cells with sand until not one of them was left alive. He then filtered the material, obtaining a clear, cell-free liquid. He added sugar to preserve it against bacterial contamination and found that before long carbon dioxide was forming vigorously. The clear extract from the yeast was doing the job of fermenting sugar just as the intact cells would have, and Buchner had demonstrated the opposite of what he had expected.

From this point on, the term enzymes was applied to all biochemical catalysts, in or out of a cell, and another bastion of vitalism had fallen.

As a result of his studies, Sabine founded the science of architectural acoustics. In the process he showed how to design a hall that would make the sounds of voice and music clear. For the purpose, he made use of mathematical equations that related absorptivity of sound by various materials and the volume of the room to the amount of reverberation.  1897

Electron as Subatomic Particle

By now Perrin’s work had convinced everyone that cathode rays consisted of negatively charged particles (see 1895). The last bit

of evidence was supplied by

the British physicist Joseph John Thomson (1856— 1940), who showed that cathode rays could be deflected not only by a magnet but by an electric field. From the amount of the deflection, Thomson could work out the ratio of the electric charge of the

cathode ray particle to its mass. This ratio turned out to be quite high, so that either the charge was high or the mass was low or both. Thomson supposed that the charge would be the unit charge worked out from Faraday’s laws of electrolysis (see 1832). If so, the mass of the cathode ray particle would be only a small fraction of the hydrogen atom'’s, the smallest atom known. (We now know that the particle has a mass only Y837 of hydrogen’s.) Thomson called the particle the electron, ing use of Stoney's suggested name for the

fundamental unit of electric charge (see 1891), since he suspected that the particle carried that fundamental unit, And to be sure, no smaller electric charge has actually been observed since then.

sulfate (see 1896) was a Polish-born French chemist, Marie Sklodowska Curie (1867—1934). She was the wife of Pierre Curie (see 1880).

In 1897 she made use of her husband’s discovery of piezoelectricity to measure the intensity of radiation given off by a variety of uranium compounds. She showed that the intensity was always in proportion to the quantity of uranium present.

This demonstrated that the radiation did not come from the compound as a whole, but from the uranium atom specifically. It was an atomic phenomenon and not a molecular one.

200,Alpha Rays and Beta Rays,"['Ernest Rutherford', 'Nickel', 'Paul Sabatier', 'Sabatier', 'Sabatier Sabatier']","['British', 'Greek', 'French']","The radiations given off by uranium were of more than one kind. Some were deflected only slightly in a direction that indicated them to be positively charged. Some were deflected much more sharply in the opposite direction and were therefore negatively charged. Both had to consist of streams of particles, and the particles of the former were clearly the more massive.

The British physicist

Ernest Rutherford (1871— 1937) noted this in 1897. He called the massive, positively charged radiation alpha rays, and the lighter, negatively charged radiation beta rays, after the first two letters of the Greek alphabet. Those names have remained in use ever since.

Nickel as Catalyst

The metal nickel combines with carbon monoxide to form a compound that is liquid at ordinary temperatures and boils at 43°C. In 1897 the French chemist Paul Sabatier (1854-1941) wondered if other volatile nickel compounds could be formed by combining the metal with other gases. He chose ethylene for his attempt, since like carbon monoxide, it has a double bond.

He failed, but found that some of the ethylene had, in the presence of nickel, changed to ethane. The double bond in ethylene had thus added two hydrogen atoms. That happens easily if a metal such as powdered platinum is used as a catalyst. Sabatier had now shown that powdered nickel, which was much cheaper, would do the same.

Sabatier went on to perfect the technique, and nickel catalysis went on eventually to make possible the formation of edible fats, such as margarine and shortenings, from inedible plant oils, such as cottonseed oil.

For this work Sabatier was awarded a share of the Nobel Prize in chemistry in 1912.

200,Mosquitoes and Malaria,"['Smith', 'Ronald Ross', 'Ross', 'Karl Ferdinand Braun', 'Braun']","['British', 'Laveran', 'German']","Smith'’s discovery of the manner in which ticks served to communicate disease (see 1893) turned the minds of pathologists in the direction of stinging insects as possible disease-spreaders.

The British physician Ronald Ross (1857-1932) devoted himself to collecting, feeding, and dissecting mosquitoes until in 1897 he discovered the malarial parasite that had been identified by Laveran (see 1880) in the anopheles mosquito. This meant that malaria might well be fought by wiping out the breeding places of these mosquitoes, by making use of mosquito netting, and so on.

For this, Ross received the Nobel Prize in physiology and medicine in 1902.  Oscilloscope

In 1897 a German physicist, Karl Ferdinand Braun (1850-1918), modified the cathode-ray tube in such a way that the spot of green fluorescence formed by the stream of speeding particles shifted in accordance with the electromagnetic field set up by a varying current.

The device was called an oscilloscope, because the spot could follow and reveal the oscillations of the field. Braun's device was the ancestor of the presentday television screen.

200,Large Refracting Telescope,"['Galileo', 'Clark', 'Sirius', 'Newton']",[],"The first telescope that Galileo used was a refracting telescope, making use of lenses only. In the nearly

three centuries since, such telescopes had grown larger and more elaborate

In 1897 Clark, the discoverer of Sirius’s dim companion (see 1844), supervised the construction of a refracting telescope with a lens 40 inches across. It was the largest and best refractor built up to that time, but it had reached the limits of the art. No larger refractor has been built since then, or is likely to be built. All larger telescopes are of the reflecting variety that Newton invented (see 1668).

1898,Diesel Engine,['Diesel'],"['Otto', 'German', 'Diesel', 'Diesel Diesel']","The four-stroke engine invented by Otto (see 1876) used low-boiling gasoline for fuel and ignited the vapor-air mixture with an electric spark.

A German inventor, Ru-

doll Diesel (1858-1913) tried to

iminate the complexities that resulted from running an electrical system in conju engine. By 1897 he had perfected a Diesel engine that ignited the vapor-air mixture by the heat developed through compression. This allowed him to use higher boiling fuel such as kerosene, which was cheaper and less inflammable (hence safer) than gasoline. However, the compression had to be great, so the Diesel engine had to be considerably larger and heavier than the Otto engine il the higher pressures were to be brought about and maintained. Diesel eng therefore found their use in heavy transport vehicles

1898,Polonium and Radium,"['Marie', 'Pierre Curie', 'Marie Curie', 'Marie Curie Marie Curie']",['Becquerel'],"Marie and Pierre Curie continued to work on the radiations produced by uranium (see 1897).

In 1898 Marie Curie showed that thorium, another heavy metal, also produced radiations, and she coined the term radioactivity for the phenomenon, so that it could be said that both uranium and thorium were radioactive.

She also discovered that although pure uranium compounds were always radioactive only to the extent that uranium was present, some uranium ores produced far more radioactivity than could be accounted for by the uranium present. It seemed to her that the ores must contain other elements (in small quantities or they would have been discovered earlier) that were much more intensely radioactive than uranium,

In July 1898 the Curies detected such an element, which they called polonium after Marie Curie's native land. In December 1898 they detected another, which they called radium

because of its intense radioactivity.

For their work on radioactivity, the Curies shared the Nobel Prize for physics with Becquerel (see 1896) in 1903. For the detection of polonium and radium, Marie Curie (her husband by then being dead) received the Nobel Prize for chemistry in 1911.

"
1898,"Neon, Krypton, and Xenon","['Ramsay', 'Morris William Travers', 'William Hampson']","['Polonium', 'British', 'British Ramsay', 'Greek']","Polonium and radium were not the only elements discovered in 1898. In the previous four years, Ramsay had discovered argon (see 1894) and helium (see 1895). There had to be several more elements in the zero-valence family, and he searched for them with the assistance of a British chemist, Morris William Travers (1872—1961).

A British inventor, William Hampson (1854— 1926), had developed a method for producing liguid air in sizable quantities. He gave some to Ramsay and Travers, who carefully distilled it and, in the argon fraction, discovered neon (from the Greek word for “new”), krypton

(hidden), and xenon (stranger). The new elements were all gases and all zero-valence. The five elements (including helium and argon) were called, as a group, the inert gases, or more recently, the noble gases.

"
1898,Liquid Hydrogen,"['Carl Paul Gottfried', 'Linde']",['German'],"Although nitrogen and other gases had been liquefied twenty years before, hydrogen still remained recalcitrant. In 1895, however, the German chemist Carl Paul Gottfried von Linde (1842-1934) had developed a technique of cooling gases in stages, by expansion, each cooled fraction being returned to cool another sample, which could be cooled still further by expansion, and so on. In this way, Linde could produce commercial quantities of liquid air.

Dewar (see 1889) adopted Linde’s system, improved it, and used it on hydrogen. The result was that in 1898 he liquefied hydrogen at a temperature of only 20° K.

Even so, that did not represent the final victory  over gases. The new group of inert gases remained. Those with the higher atomic weights were easily liquefied, to be sure. Even neon, with the next-to-lowest atomic weight, could be liquefied at 27° K.

Helium, however, with the lowest atomic weight of the inert gases, remained a gas even at liquid-hydrogen temperatures.

1898,Phoebe,"['William Henry Pickering', 'Phoebe', 'Saturn']","['American', 'Saturn', 'Saturn Cronos', 'Greek']","In 1898 the American astronomer William Henry Pickering (1858—1938) discovered a ninth satellite of Saturn, which he named Phoebe, after still another of the siblings of Saturn (Cronos) in the Greek myths. It was far more distant from Saturn than the satellites discovered earlier, and it revolved around the planet in a retrograde direction (clockwise rather than counterclockwise, if viewed from high above Saturn’s north pole), so that it is considered to be a captured asteroid.

1898,Eros,"['Earth', 'Venus', 'Mars', 'Jupiter', 'Gustav Witt', 'Mars Earth', 'Venus Witt', 'Mars Mars', 'Earth Venus', 'Eros']","['Kepler', 'German', 'Venus', 'Greek']","Since the time of Kepler, it had been thought that, except for the Moon, no sizable object approached Earth more closely than the planet Venus, which at its closest can be only 25,000,000 miles away from

us. As for the swarming asteroids, they seemed all to be circling between the orbits of Mars and Jupiter, and none were expected to approach more closely than 35,000,000 miles.

But then, on August 13, 1898, the German astronomer Gustav Witt discovered asteroid number 433. When its orbit was plotted, it proved to be a real stunner. At aphelion (when it is most distant from the Sun), it is well within the asteroid belt. At perihelion, however, it is only 105,000,000 miles from the Sun—well within the orbit of Mars. At its closest to the Earth, the two could be only a little over 14,000,000 miles apart.

Since it approached Earth more closely than Mars or Venus did, Witt gave it the name of the child of Mars and Venus in the Greek myths—Eros. That began the habit of giving masculine names to asteroids whose orbits extend outside the asteroid belt.

Since then, other asteroids have been discovered with orbits that intersect that of Mars. All those that can approach Earth more closely than Venus does are called Earth-grazers. Eros was the first of these to be discovered and is the largest, being at least 15 miles in its longest diameter.

1898,Filtrable Virus,"['Pasteur', 'Dmitri', 'Ivanovsky', 'Ivanovsky Martinus Willem Beijerinck']","['Russian', 'Dutch', 'Latin']","Pasteur had not been able to find a microorganism that caused rabies (see 1885). Rather than suppose there was something wrong with the germ theory of disease, however, he suggested that the causative agent existed but was too small to see even by microscope.

Another disease with no known causative agent was tobacco mosaic disease, so called because a mosaic pattern forms on the leaves of the tobacco plant. It was easier to work with a plant disease than with something as virulent as rabies, and in 1892, a Russian botanist, Dmitri losifovich Ivanovsky (1864— 1920), mashed up infected leaves and passed the fluid through a fine filter that would keep back all bacteria.

The fluid that passed through the filter could still infect healthy tobacco plants with the disease, but Ivanovsky could not bring himself to believe there were causative agents smaller than bacteria and supposed simply that the filters were defective.

In 1898 the Dutch botanist Martinus Willem Beijerinck (1851-1931) did a similar experiment, but he had no hesitation in maintaining that there was a causative agent smaller

than bacteria. He did not know what it might be, so he simply called it a filtrable virus (virus is the Latin word for “poison”).

It turned out that a considerable number of human diseases were caused by viruses, including the common cold, influenza, chickenpox, mumps, and poliomyelitis. Such diseases were not as easily handled as those caused by larger organisms such as bacteria and protozoa.

1898,Mitochondria,['Carl Benda'],"['German', 'Greek']","As microscopes improved, it was clear that the cell

did not consist of a homogeneous fluid but had a complex structure, even outside the nucleus. In 1898 the German histologist Carl Benda (1857-1933) made out tiny bodies in the cytoplasm. He called them mitochondria, from Greek words meaning ‘'threads of cartilage,” which is what he thought they were. They turned out to be far more than that.

words meaning “‘at the kidney”’) are small lumps of tissue above each kidney.

They first came into prominence in 1855, when a Brit-

ish physician, Thomas Addison (1793-1860), showed that the deterioration of the adrenal glands gave rise to a serious condition (known as Addison’s disease to this day).

In 1894 a British physiologist, Edward Albert Sharpey-Schafer (1850— 1935), showed that a substance extracted from the adrenals would raise the blood pressure if injected into an animal’s bloodstream.

An American pharmacologist, John Jacob Abel (1857-1938), was able to study this substance in 1898, and he named it epinephrine (from Greek words meaning “above the kidney”’). Three years later, a Japanese chemist, Jokichi Takamine (1854-1922), working in the United States, isolated the substance in pure, crystalline form. He called it adrenaline. Both names are still used.

Actually epinephrine/ adrenaline was the first hormone to be isolated, but the hormone concept had not yet been elaborated.

nelis Jacobszoon Drebbel (1572-1633), who piloted one in the Thames River between 1620 and 1624. An American inventor, David Bushnell (1742-1824), devised simple submarines that were used unsuccessfully against British ships in harbor during the Revolutionary War and the War of 1812,

It was not till 1898, however, that an American mechanical engineer, Simon Lake (1866—1945), succeeded in devising a submarine that could actually go out to sea. In that year, his submarine Argonaut I sailed from Norfolk, Virginia, to New York. This marked the true beginning of modern submarines.    1899

In 1899 the French chemist AndréLouis Debierne (1874— 1949), a close [riend of the Curies, isolated still another element from the ores. He called it actinium, from a Greek word for “ray,” so that the name was the Greek equivalent of the Latin radium.

1898,Logic and Geometry,"['David Hilbert', 'Again', 'Hilbert']","['German', 'Geometry']","In 1899 the German mathematician David Hilbert (1862—-1943) published

Foundations of Geometry, in which he proposed a set of axioms for geometry that was the most satisfactory vet, He began with points, lines, and planes as undefined concepts. It was not necessary to define them, merely to describe certain properties they possessed. He also used certain relationships, such as between, parallel, and continuous, without defining them. Again, provided the consequences of using those words were clearly set forth, it didn’t matter what they actually meant. Hilbert proved his system of axioms to be self-consistent, and that was crucial.

1900,Solid Hydrogen,[],['Dewar'],"Dewar, who had liquefied hydrogen the year before, took another step toward absolute zero by producing solid hydrogen in 1899. This brought the lowest temperature ever obtained down to 14° K. At this temperature, all known substances but one were solid. The only exception was helium, which even at this temperature remained gaseous.

"
1900,Quanta,"['Kirchhoff', 'Rayleigh', 'Rayleigh Wien', 'Max Karl Ernst Ludwig Planck', 'Planck', 'Planck Planck']","['Wien', 'German']","Kirchhoff had pointed out that a black body (one that absorbed all electromagnetic radiation that fell on it) would radiate at all wavelengths if heated (see 1860). Thus, a hollow body with a small hole in it would absorb all the radiation that entered through the hole, for virtually none of it would be reflected and find its way out again. If such a body was heated, radiation would therefore emerge from the hole at all wavelengths, with very little at the extremes and with a peak at some intermediate value. The higher the temperature, the shorter the wavelength of the peak value.

A number of physicists tried to work out mathematical equations for the distribution of wavelengths in such black body radia-

tion. Rayleigh and Wien (see 1894) both advanced equations in 1900, but Rayleigh'’s worked well only for the long-wavelength half, and Wien's only for the short-wavelength half. Neither one could work out an equation that gave the distribution across the board.

Then a German physicist, Max Karl Ernst Ludwig Planck (1858-1947), produced an equation that did just that. In order to derive that equation, he had to assume that energy was given off not continuously but in discrete pieces, and that the size of the piece was inversely proportional to the wavelength. Thus, since violet light had half the wavelength of red light, violet light would be delivered in pieces that were twice the size, and therefore twice the energy content, of red light.

Planck called the bits

of energy quanta (singular, quantum, a Latin word meaning “how much? worked out the relationship between energy and wavelength (or energy and frequency, since frequency is 1 divided by the wavelength), making use of a very small value called Planck’s constant, which represents the “graininess” of energy. Since Planck’s constant is exceedingly small, energy has a very fine grain indeed, and it is not noticeable in most circumstances, so that the laws of thermodynamics could be deduced as though energy were a continuous fluid without grain. The problem of black body radiation was the first in which the graininess had to be taken into account

There was no evidence, at first, for the existence of quanta, except for the fact that it made the equation for black body radiation

possible. Even Planck himself suspected that quanta might be only a mathematical device that had no physical meaning.

Nevertheless, the quantum theory, as it is now called, proved so fundamental that all physics prior to 1900 is called classical physics and all physics after 1900 modern physics.

For his work, Planck received the Nobel Prize for physics in 1918.

"
1900,Mass Increase,['Lorentz'],['Lorentz'],"Lorentz had maintained that mass increased with velocity (see 1895). It did not seem at the time that this could ever be checked, for the velocities needed to make the change in mass measurable were too huge to deal with in the laboratory.

As physicists began to study the speeding electrons involved in cathode rays, and in other phenomena, however, it turned out that electrons might be moving at respectable fractions of the speed of light— up to 90 percent in some cases. This meant the mass increase ought to be measurable, since fast electrons, becoming more massive than slow ones, would bend less sharply in response to electromagnetic fields. This turned out to be so, and the increase in

mass, measured in 1900 for the first time, matched quite closely the theoretical predictions of Lorentz.

The Lorentz-FitzGerald contraction was borne out, but physicists had to wait five more years before a comprehensive physical theory that explained it was advanced.

"
1900,Beta Particles,['Becquerel'],['Becquerel'],"Becquerel, who had discovered uranium radiations (see 1896) continued to study them. The beta rays were clearly composed of negatively charged beta particles, and from the way these curved in a magnetic field of a particular strength, they seemed to resemble electrons. In 1900, after a close study of the properties of beta particles, Becquerel decided that they were electrons.

Until then, electrons had seemed to be associated only with electric currents, as in the case of cathode rays. Now it seemed they were associated with atoms as well— at least with radioactive atoms.

1900,Gamma Rays,"['Paul Ulrich Villard', 'Becquerel']","['French', 'Greek']","In 1900 the French physicist Paul Ulrich Villard (1860—1934), studying the radiations from uranium that Becquerel had discov-

ered, noted that in addition to alpha rays and beta rays, there was some radiation that was totally unaffected by magnets.

This, it was decided, consisted of electromagnetic radiation. Its properties were very much like those of X rays, but it was even more penetrating and therefore even shorter in wavelength. It came to be called gamma rays, after the third letter of the Greek alphabet.

"
1900,Radon,"['Friedrich Ernst Dorn', 'Curie']",['German'],"A German physicist, Friedrich Ernst Dorn (1848-1916), studying the radium that Curie had discovered (see 1898), found in 1900 that it gave off not only radiations but a gas that was itself radioactive. The gas was called radium emanation at first, but on closer study it turned out to be a noble gas (see 1898), the sixth one, and was named radon.

"
1900,Atomic Change,"['Crookes', 'Becquerel']",['Crookes'],"In 1900 Crookes (see 1861) found that it was possible to treat a solution of uranium compound in such a way that part of it would be removed as an insoluble material. The removed portion was an impurity, the uranium compound itself remaining in solution.  But almost all the radioactivity was in the insoluble impurity and very little in the uranium compound. Crookes suspected that uranium itself might not be radioactive at all.

However, as Becquerel speedily pointed out, the purified uranium compound, which was only slightly radioactive if at all steadily gained in radioactive intensity if allowed to remain standing. It was then suggested that uranium was at least slightly radioactive and that as it gave off its radiations, its atoms were converted into other kinds of atoms, which were much more intensely radioactive than uranium.

This was the first suggestion that radioactivity might represent the spontaneous change of one kind of atom into another. If this was true, it would imply that atoms had structure, and that rearrangement of the still-smaller particles that made up atoms took place in the course of radioactive breakdown.

1900,Electron Emission,"['Edison', 'Owen Willans Richardson']",['British'],"Edison had discovered the Edison effect—that an electric current seemed to jump the gap between the heated filament of an elec-

tric light bulb and a cold metal rod (see 1883).

Beginning in 1900, the British physicist Owen Willans Richardson (1879— 1959) studied the phenomenon and realized that heated metals tended to emit speeding electrons, which carried the electricity. His observation made it possible to apply the Edison effect to the developing electronic technology.

For his work, he received the Nobel Prize in physics in 1928.

1900,Mutations,"['Hugo Marie De Vries', 'Mendel', 'Unknown', 'De Vries', 'Karl Erich Correns', 'Erich Tschermak', 'Mendel Mendel']","['American', 'Netherlands', 'Dutch', 'German', 'Austrian', 'Mendel']","The American evening primrose had been introduced into the Netherlands in the 1880s, and in 1886 a Dutch botanist, Hugo Marie De Vries (1848— 1935), came across a colony of them growing in a clump in a meadow. He could see that some were very different from others, even though it seemed likely that all had grown from a common batch of seeds.

He dug them up, took them to his garden, and bred them separately and together. By 1900 he had evolved the laws of genetics that Mendel had worked out (see 1865).

Unknown to De Vries and to each other, two other botanists were making the same rediscovery. One was a German, Karl

Erich Correns (1864-1933), and the other an Austrian, Erich Tschermak von Seysenegg (1871-1962).

Each of the three independently decided to publish his discovery, and each of the three found, on searching the literature, that he had been anticipated by Mendel. Each of the three (in a remarkable display of scientific ethics) reported Mendel as the discoverer and presented his own work merely as confirmation.

De Vries, however, went beyond Mendel. He had observed that the primroses didn't always breed true, that some characteristics appeared that didn’t seem to exist in earlier generations. He suggested, therefore, that evolution did not always proceed in small, nearly microscopic steps, but sometimes in changes large enough to be clearly visible. He called these visible changes mutations (from a Latin word for “change”), and indeed the concept of mutations now forms an integral and indispensable part of the theory of evolution.

1900,Blood Types,"['Karl Landsteiner', 'Clumped', 'Landsteiner']","['European', 'Austrian', 'Plasma', 'B']","Although the usual eighteenth-century practice was to remove blood from a sick patient, there were occasional physicians who tried

to add blood to patients, taking it from the veins of healthy humans or even from animals. Sometimes it was helpful, but sometimes it hastened death, so that most European nations by the end of the nineteenth century had prohibited such blood transfusion.

In 1900, however, an Austrian physician, Karl Landsteiner (1868—1943), was able to demonstrate some specific properties of human blood. Plasma (the liquid portion of blood) from one donor might clump red cells from person A but not from person B. Serum from another donor might clump red cells from person B but not from person A. Still other samples of plasma might clump both—or neither.

Clumped red cells could block blood vessels and lead to death. Therefore, it was necessary in performing a blood transfusion to know that the blood of the donor would not clump the red cells of the receiver. Landsteiner showed that human blood fell into four classes: O, A, B, and AB. It was always safest if both donor and receiver were in the same class. In an emergency, O blood could be given to any receiver, but A blood could be given only to A and AB receivers, B blood only to B and AB re-

ceivers, and AB blood only to AB receivers. Landsteiner made blood transfusion rational and safe and added an important weapon to the medical armory. For this discovery, he received the Nobel Prize in medicine and physiology in 1930.

1900,Yellow Fever,"['Walter Reed', 'Ross', 'Jesse William Lazear', 'Yellow']","['Yellow', 'New York', 'United States', 'American', 'American Cuba', 'Cuba']","Yellow fever was a terrifying scourge of coastal cities. New York and Philadelphia, for instance, were periodically hit, and many deaths followed.

The Spanish-American War made the United States particularly diseaseconscious, as far more American soldiers died from disease and from tainted meat than died from enemy bullets.

The American military surgeon Walter Reed (1851-1902) was sent to Cuba in 1899 to see if he could do something about yellow fever, He had already showed, in 1897, that it was not caused by a bacterium, as had been earlier proposed.

His studies in Cuba showed that the disease was not transmitted by bodily contact, by clothing, or by bedding. He suspected mosquito carriers, as Ross had shown was the case with malaria (see

1897). The case was proved for yellow fever, too, in 1900, when doctors allowed mosquitoes to sting patients and then themselves. One doctor, Jesse William Lazear (1866—1900), died as a result.

Yellow fever was brought under control by fighting mosquitoes and destroying their breeding grounds. The last yellow fever epidemic in the United States was in New Orleans in 1905.

"
1900,Dreams,"['Dreams', 'Dreams Dreams']","['Freud', 'Dreams']","Dreams had always mystified human beings. Dreaming that dead people were alive helped lead to a belief in the spirit world. Erotic dreams led to belief in incubi and succubi. Dreams seemed to be doorways into a different world, to be messages from the gods, to be revelations of events at a distance or in the future.

All this was dismissed as superstition by rationalists, but Freud (see 1884) gave new meaning to dreams.

In 1900 he published The Interpretation of Dreams. Dreams, he maintained, might represent truths about human beings that they were not willing to accept in their waking hours, so that psychoanalysis might be hastened and  made more effective if the analyst carefully considered the literal and symbolic meaning of dreams.

1900,Tryptophan,"['Frederick Gowland Hopkins', 'Francois Magendie', 'Hopkins']","['British', 'Greek', 'French']","By now, some thirteen different amino acids had been isolated, each of which were among the building blocks of protein molecules. Still another was isolated in 1900 by the British biochemist Frederick Gowland Hopkins (1861—-1947). He called it tryptophan, from Greek words meaning “appearing through trypsin,” because he had obtained it from protein molecules that had been broken down by the digestive enzyme trypsin.

A French physiologist, Francois Magendie (1783— 1855), had shown, in 1815, that animals could not be kept alive if gelatin was the only protein fed them. Hopkins found that tryptophan did not occur in gelatin, and he suggested that tryptophan could not be formed in the body from other substances but had to be present as such in the diet.

All the amino acids that are found as part of protein molecules are essential to life, but only some are essential as such in the diet. It is to these latter that the term essential

amino acids refers. Hopkins originated this concept, and it proved an important finding in the field of dietetics and food chemistry.

"
1900,Free Radicals,"['Moses Gomberg', 'Gomberg', 'Gomberg Ferdinand Adolf', 'Heinrich']","['Organic', 'American', 'Otto', 'German', 'Zeppelin']","Organic chemists find it interesting to try to synthesize compounds of unusual structure. The Russianborn American chemist Moses Gomberg (1866— 1947) tried to attach a carbon atom to four different benzene rings. There is scarcely room around a single carbon atom for four such bulky groupings, and a number of chemists had tried and failed. Gomberg, however, succeeded in forming small quantities of this compound, called tetraphenylmethane.

He next tried to attach six benzene rings to two carbon atoms hooked together, thus forming hexaphenylethane. This he could not do, but he did get a strongly colored compound that did not have the properties to be expected of hexaphenylethane.

Gomberg studied the colored compound carefully and, in 1900, came to the conclusion that he had a half-molecule. The hexaphenylethane tended to break in two and leave him with two single carbon atoms, each with three ben-

zene rings attached—triphenylmethyl.

Ordinarily the carbon atom is attached to four different groups, but in this case it was attached to only three, while the fourth bond was unoccupied. When compounds form, there may be moments when a carbon atom loses a fourth attachment and has not yet gained a substitute attachment, but this usually lasts such a brief time that it isn't noticeable.

Such groupings with a carbon bond unattached are called radicals. Something like triphenylmethyl, which lasts for a perceptible time, is called a free radical. The explanation for the existence of such free radicals was not advanced for over three decades more.

Dirigible Balloons had been in operation for over a century, and it was easy to see that if one could place a steam engine in a balloon's gondola and attach a propeller to it, the balloon might be guided in any desired direction, even dead against the wind. However, steam engines are very heavy, and supporting one by balloon would not be easy.

The coming of Otto's internal-combustion engine (see 1876) offered a much  lighter energy source, but even so it was difficult to force a balloon through the air against air resistance.

It occurred to a German inventor, Ferdinand Adolf August Heinrich von Zeppelin (1838-1917), to streamline a balloon so that it would meet with less air resistance. This could be done by confining it within a cigar-shaped metal envelope. The HallHeroult method had made aluminum cheap (see 1886), and aluminum had the combination of lightness and strength needed to

make such a streamlined balloon feasible.

On July 2, 1900, one of Zeppelin's cigar-shaped vessels rose into the air. Beneath it was a gondola bearing an internal-combustion engine and a propeller. For the first time, an aircraft was not at the merey of the wind but could move in any direction at will. It was called a dirigible balloon; that is, “a balloon that could be directed.” This was soon abbreviated to dirigible, and the device was also sometimes called a zeppelin after its inventor.

Yet Homer, describing the Trojan War, gave Crete an important role, and in the Greek myths, Crete, under its king Minos, was described as dominating Greece in early times.

A British archaeologist, Arthur John Evans (1851— 1941), felt there might be some historical fact in that myth and, beginning in 1894, he engaged in archaeological excavations in Greece. By 1900 he had dug up the site of Knossos, the capital of Crete in Minos’s legendary time. (Evans called it the Minoan civilization after the king.) He showed that a complex and advanced civilization had indeed existed for nearly two thousand years before the Trojan War, and that it had indeed dominated the islands of the Aegean and parts of the Greek mainland for a long period.  1901

He needed a catalyst, Zinc shavings and magnesium shavings did some good but not much. Frankland (see 1852) had reported on zinc combinations with organic compounds using diethyl

ether as the solvent. Grignard tried it with magnesium instead, in 1901, and found he had the catalyst he needed. Magnesium-organic compounds dissolved in diethyl ether are called Grignard reagents and proved extraordinarily useful to organic chemists who were trying to build up relatively complicated compounds. For this work, Grignard shared with Sabatier (see 1897) the Nobel Prize in chemistry in 1912.

Mother and father each contributed one of that pair to the offspring, who in this way inherited characteristics from each parent.

By the time Mendel’s work had been rediscovered by De Vries and others (see 1900), the role of chromosomes in cell division had been worked out by Flemming (see 1882) and their role in the formation of sex cells had been researched by Beneden (see 1883).

In 1902, then, an American geneticist, Walter Stanborough Sutton (1877— 1916), made a suggestion that in hindsight seems obvious. He pointed out that chromosomes were (or contained) the genetic factors Mendel spoke of. He proved to be correct,

the small intestine, How does the pancreas “know”’ that food, requiring digestion, is making its appearance? The natural assumption is that the entering food stimulates a nerve that in turn stimulates the pancreas. The Russian physiologist Ivan Petrovich Pavlov (1849— 1936) suggested that this was So.

Two British physiologists, Ernest Henry Starling (1866—1927) and his brother-in-law, William Maddock Bayliss (1860— 1924), tested the matter. They cut all the nerves leading to the pancreas—yet it still performed on cue.

They then discovered that the lining of the small intestine secreted a substance (which they named secretin) under the influence of stomach acid. It was this secretin that stimulated the pancreatic flow. In short, then, Starling and Bayliss had discovered that it was possible for chemical messages as well as nerve messages to exist in the body.

Eventually other chemical messengers were discovered and Starling suggested they be called hormones, from Greek

words meaning “‘to rouse to activity.” Secretin was the first hormone to be recognized as such, but epinephrine, isolated by Abel (see 1898), turned out to be a hormone, also.

cessfully on diphtheria (see 1883). To his surprise, Richet discovered that if he caused an animal to produce an immune serum to a particular foreign protein (an antigen) and then injected the antigen, the animal died. In 1902 Richet named this phenomenon anaphylaxis, from Greek words meaning ""“overprotection.”

From then on, physicians were warned. Serum therapy had to be conducted in such a way as to prevent the possibility of sensitization, which would produce serum sickness. It came to be understood that people might be sensitized to foreign proteins in the environment—in plant pollen, in dust, in food—and exhibit unpleasant reactions. These reactions came to be called allergies (from Greek words meaning “other work,” because the mechanisms of the body do something other than the work they are supposed to do).

By subjecting uranium and thorium to chemical manipulations and following the fate of the radioactivity, they demonstrated that the two elements broke down in the course of radioactivity into a series of intermediate elements.

1902,Photoelectric Effect and Electrons,"['Hertz', 'Lenard', 'Marconi', 'Earth', 'Arthur Edwin Kennelly', 'Oliver Heaviside']","['England', 'Newfoundland', 'American', 'British']","Hertz had first noted the photoelectric effect—the greater ease which which electric sparks cross small gaps when ultraviolet light falls upon those gaps—fourteen years before (see 1887). Now that electrons were known, the photoelectric effect could be studied more effectively.

Lenard (see 1895) showed in 1902 that the electrical effects produced by light falling upon certain metals were the result of electrons being emitted from the metal surface. He showed that only light of a certain wavelength or shorter could bring about electron emission from a particular metal, and that the crucial wavelength was different for different metals.

Increasing intensity of light of a given wavelength resulted in the emission of a greater number of electrons, but the energy of the individual electrons remained the same. If the wavelength decreased, the electrons emitted had higher energy; if the wavelength increased, the electrons emitted had lower energies. There was no way of explaining this by nineteenth-century physics.  Even unexplained, however, the photoelectric effect made it appear that electrons existed in matter even when electric currents were not involved. The fact that identical electrons were emitted by various metals made it seem that electrons were a constituent of all atoms without exception.

KennellyHeaviside Layer

The fact that Marconi’s message, generated in southwestern England, was picked up in Newfoundland (see 1901) presented a puzzle. Electromagnetic radiation, including radio waves, travels in straight lines. Even if the radio waves were traveling parallel to the ground to begin with, they should have headed off into outer space as the Earth'’s surface curved downward. (Earth is a sphere, after all.) Instead, the signal apparently clung to the neighborhood of Earth’s surface, working its way around the Earth’s spherical curve across the Atlantic Ocean.

A British-born American electrical engineer, Arthur Edwin Kennelly (1861-1939), suggested that there might be a layer of electric charges in the upper atmosphere, which

would serve to reflect radio waves. In that case, the radio waves would bounce between earth and clouds, thus explaining why they clung to the bulge of the Earth.

A British electrical engineer, Oliver Heaviside (1850-1925), independently advanced the same idea, so that the supposed layer of charged particles came to be called the Kennelly-Heaviside layer. It was to be twenty years before these speculations were proved correct.

1902,Stratosphere,['Bort'],"['French', 'Bort', 'Earth', 'Greek']","Ever since balloons had been invented (see 1783), scientists had used them to explore heights that they could otherwise reach only by climbing the highest mountains. However, by the time a balloon was 6 miles in the air, the cold and lack of oxygen could be fatal.

The French meteorologist Léon-Philippe Teisserenc de Bort (1855-1913) therefore took to sending up balloons bearing only instruments that could be read when the balloon returned to Earth.

He found in this way that the temperature of the atmosphere dropped steadily up to a height of about 7 miles. At higher altitudes, the temperature remained

constant as high as he could reach.

In 1902 Teisserenc de Bort suggested that the atmosphere be divided into two parts. The lower part, below the 7-mile mark, had temperature variations and therefore produced winds, clouds, and in short, the weather changes so familiar to us. This would be called the troposphere (from Greek words meaning “sphere of change”). Above it would be the constanttemperature stratosphere (“sphere of layers,” because Teisserenc de Bort felt that constant temperature meant the gases would lie in undisturbed layers). The names have remained with us ever since.

In fact he spent almost twenty years putting together a system of symbolic logic that would serve as the basis of all mathematics, reducing it to complete rigor by minimizing assumptions and proving each step.

In 1902, when the second volume was in galleys,

Frege received a letter from the British mathematician Bertrand Arthur William Russell (1872-1970). The letter contained a question about an apparent self-contradiction in Frege's system and asked Frege to remove it. Frege, after deep thought, realized that his system of logic could not handle the contradiction, so that he found his project worthless at the moment of completion.

This failure was to have important ramifications in mathematics.

1903,Uktramicroscope,"['Thomas Graham', 'Graham', 'John Tyndall', 'Richard Adolf Zsigmondy', 'Zsigmondy']","['Greek', 'Irish', 'German']","Substances such as salt and sugar, which dissolve in water, separate into single ions or molecules of the same order of size as the water molecules among which they are dispersed. Sometimes substances are made up of giant molecules, such as those of proteins, or disperse as clusters of ordinary small molecules, the clusters

being of comparatively large size.

In 1861 the Scottish physical chemist Thomas Graham (1805-1869) noted that small molecules in solution could pass through membranes with fine holes, such as a sheet of parchment. Large molecules or molecular clusters in solution could not. Graham called the former crystalloids, because crystalline solids usually dissolved as small molecules. The latter he called colloids, from the Greek for “'glue,” because a solution of glue contained large molecules (proteins, usually) that did not pass through the parchment.

The Irish physicist John Tyndall (1820-1893) pointed out that light passing through a crystalloidal solution was not affected by the molecules of water or dissolved material. Such solutions were optically clear. The larger molecules or molecular clusters in colloids scattered light, on the other hand, and did so

more effectively for the shorter wavelengths. This is the Tyndall effect.

Tyndall pointed out that dust particles in the air scattered shortwave light particularly, so that the sky was blue and the Sun at setting (when its light passed through a great thickness of dusty air) was red—the long waves being less scattered.

The Austrian-born German chemist Richard Adolf Zsigmondy (1865-1929) took advantage of this scattering of light by colloidal particles in 1902. He sent a beam of light through a colloidal solution and viewed the light scattered at right angles to the beam through a microscope. In this way, colloidal particles, invisible to ordinary microscopes, could be seen, in what Zsigmondy called an ultramicro-

scope.

For his work on colloids with his ultramicroscope, Zsigmondy was awarded the Nobel Prize for chemistry in 1925.

The ‘ American astronomer Sam\ uel Pierpont Langley (1834—1906) made the attempt on three separate occasions between 1897 and 1903 and almost succeeded but not quite.

Then two brothers, Orville (1871-1948) and Wilbur (1867—-1912) Wright took up the task. They made shrewd corrections in design and invented “ailerons,” movable wing tips that enabled the pilot to control the plane. In addition, they built a crude wind tunnel to test their models, and they designed new engines of unprecedented lightness for the power they could deliver.

On December 13, 1903, at Kitty Hawk, North Carolina, Orville Wright made the first powered flight in a | heavier-than-air machine. It remained in the air for al-

most a minute and covered 850 feet. Such devices soon came to be called airplanes.

He wrote of space suits, satellites, and the colonization of the solar system. He was the first to suggest the possibility of a space station.

It seemed natural to suppose, then, that the heart, beating rhythmically, might give rise to rhythmic electric po-

tentials. Perhaps a departure from the natural rhythm might be used to diagnose pathological conditions before they could be discovered in any

other way. The problem was to detect the small currents with sufficient accuracy.

In 1903 a Dutch physiologist, Willem Einthoven (1860-1927), developed the first string galvanometer. This consisted of a delicate conducting thread stretched across a magnetic field. A current flowing through the thread would cause it to deviate at right angles to the direction of the magnetic lines of force. The delicacy of the device was sulficient to make it possible to record the varying electrical potentials of the heart.

The result was an electrocardiogram. The abbreviation is EKG because in German -cardio- is spelled with a k. For the development of electrocardiography, Einthoven was awarded the Nobel Prize for medicine and physiology in 1924,

1904,Electronic Rectifier,['John Ambrose Fleming'],"['British', 'United States']","A British electrical engineer, John Ambrose Fleming (1849-1945), studied the Edison effect on a hot filament and a cold plate enclosed in an evacuated glass vessel and separated by a gap. He noted that the electric current only flowed across the gap if the hot filament was the negative electrode (the cathode) and the cold plate was the positive electrode (the anode). In that case, electrons poured into the hot filament and were driven off by the heat. If the current was reversed and electrons poured into the cold plate,

there was insufficient energy to send them flying outward.

If an alternating current was sent through the vessel, the anode and cathode changed place many times a second, and there was a spurt of electrons each time the filament was a cathode but nothing when it was an anode. The current went in as an alternating current but came flowing out in only one direction, as a direct current, even if the flow was in little gushes.

In this way, the vessel containing the filament and plate acted as an electronic rectifier, because it let electricity through in only one direction. Fleming called it

a valve, which is descriptive. In the United States, however, it was for some reason called a tube, which is not descriptive. Because it contains two electrodes, it can also be called a diode.

Fleming's rectifier was the first of a long line of radio tubes (so called because they became most familiar to the general public in radios) that made electronic devices work.

1904,Atomic Structure,['Thomson'],[],"With the discovery of the electron and its emission from many different metals by way of the photoelectric effect, there was no use in  continuing to pretend that the atom was a featureless, indivisible particle. It had to have a structure involving electrons, and the first to speculate on that structure was Thomson, who had discovered the electron (see 1897).

In 1904 he suggested that the atom was positively charged electricity in which negatively charged electrons were embedded (like raisins in a pound cake) in just sufficient quantity to neutralize the positive charge. Naturally, under stress, such as that produced by electric currents or light, the electrons could be jarred loose from the atom.

The suggestion was interesting but quickly proved inadequate. However, it did set people to thinking seriously about atomic structure.

1904,Coenzyme,"['Buchner', 'Arthur Harden', 'Harden', 'Harden Harden']",['British'],"Once Buchner had shown that yeast enzyme could be extracted from yeast and still be active (see 1896), it became a popular substance for experimentation. In 1904 the British biochemist Arthur Harden (1865—1940) placed an extract of yeast in a bag made of a semipermeable membrane (see 1748) in order to dialyze the extract and re-

move any small molecules that might be present.

Harden found to his surprise that when he did this, the material left behind in the bag lost its activity—it no longer fermented sugar. Did the enzyme have so small a molecular size that it passed through the semipermeable membrane? No, for the material outside the bag showed no activity either. However, if the material outside the bag was poured back into the bag, the combined mixture showed enzyme activity.

Harden concluded that an enzyme might consist of two parts, a large part that could not go through the semipermeable membrane and a small part that could and was so loosely held that it easily broke away and did go through the membrane,

The material that remained inside the bag, if it was boiled, did not regain activity when the material outside the bag was added. If the material outside the bag was boiled, it could still restore activity if added to unboiled material inside the bag. The conclusion was that the large molecule was a protein, since protein molecules are routinely destroyed by boiling. The small molecule was not.

Harden called the small molecule a coenzyme, and the name came to be applied to any nonprotein structure of relatively small size that proves essential to the activity of an enzyme. Not all enzymes require coenzymes, but coenzymes, when they do exist, eventually explained a great deal about the workings of enzymes and the requirements of diet.

1904,Organic Tracers,"['Franz Knoop', 'Knoop', 'Knoop Fatty', 'Knoop Knoop', 'Ideally']",['German'],"The body is a “black box.""” We know what goes in, in the way of food and air; we know what comes out, in the way of waste products. But what happens in between? All the changes from beginning to end are referred to as metabolism. Those changes that are hidden inside the body are called intermediary metabolism.

In 1904 a German biochemist, Franz Knoop (1875—1946), tried an ingenious trick that he thought might give some hint of what went on inside the body. He attached benzene rings to the long carbon chains of the fatty acids that make up fats. The benzene ring is not easily destroyed in the body, and Knoop expected it to show up in the urine.

Knoop found that if the

fatty acids had an even number of carbon atoms, the waste product was a benzene ring attached to a two-carbon fragment. Fatty acids with an odd number of carbon atoms produced a benzene ring attached to a one-carbon fragment. From this, Knoop decided that fatty acids were broken down in the body by having two-carbon fragments snipped off, one after the other, to the point where the next snip would involve a benzene ring. They were probably also built up two carbons at a time, so that the fatty acids that occur naturally in living things always have even numbers of carbon atoms. (Those with odd numbers that Knoop worked with were synthesized in the laboratory.) The benzene ring acts like a label attached to the molecule, one that allows the final fragment of the molecule to be identified. It is considered a fracer, because it enables scientists to trace the route of a particular compound as it works its way through intermediary metabolism. Of course the benzene ring is not a natural component of the fatty acids, and there was always the chance that the presence of this unnatural grouping might distort the workings of intermediary metabo-

lism. Ideally, a tracer should be perfectly natural and yet perfectly identifiable at the same time. That seemed too much to ask for, but such tracers were eventually found.

In 1904, for instance, a molecule named novocaine, or procaine, was found, with a structure something like part of a cocaine molecule. It acted as a local anesthetic but was much safer to use than cocaine, so that it became highly important to dentists.

Chemists weren't always so lucky. In 1898 a modified molecule of morphine was found to be even more effective as a painreliever than morphine itself. After a few years, it was recognized to be even more dangerous and addictive. It was heroin.

The Dutch astronomer Jacobus Cornelis Kapteyn (1851-1922) found out differently. Observing numerous stars, he was able to conclude by 1904 that there were two huge streams of stars moving in opposite directions; three-fifths of the stars were in one, and twofifths in the other, The reason for this wasn't clear, but at least it showed that there was order to the movement of the many millions of stars that made up the Milky Way Galaxy.

The next year he discovered  a seventh, even smaller, satellite, only 50 miles across. Both circled Jupiter at average distances of 7,000,000 miles or so, far outside Jupi-

The work of FitzGerald (see 1892) and Lorentz (see 1895) got rid of the difficulty in a way, but the notion of decrease of distance and increase of mass seemed to hang in the air without an overall physical theory for support

The German-born physicist Albert Einstein (1879—

1955) supplied that in 1905.

He began with the assumption that the speed of light in a vacuum would always be the same, regardless of the motion of the light source relative to the observer. This was what Michelson and Morley had observed, but Einstein maintained that he was unaware of the MichelsonMorley results when he worked out his theory From this assumption it was possible to deduce length contraction and

mass increase with veloeity. It was also possible to deduce that the speed of light in a vacuum was an absolute speed limit and that the rate of time-flow would decrease with velocity.

thing as ""absolute space” or “absolute time,” since both depend on velocity and therefore have meaning only relative to the viewer. Nevertheless, despite this absence of absolutes, the laws of physics still held for all “frames of reference.” In particular, Maxwell's equations (see 1865) still held, though the much older and more revered laws of motion as worked out by Newton had to be modified.

The theory is special, because it confines itself to the special case of objects that are moving at constant velocity. Under those conditions, the theory does not take into account the effect of gravitational interactions, which are everywhere present and which force accelerations on motion.

Einstein's view of the Universe seemed to go against common sense, but that was only because the average person deals with a Universe of small distances and small velocities. Under those conditions, Newton's theories hold almost perfectly. In fact, Einstein’s equations reduce to Newton’s under such conditions. However, where large distances and large velocities are involved, Einstein’s equations hold and Newton’s do not.

In the eight decades

since special relativity was advanced, endless tests and observations have upheld it completely. No divergences between reality and the Einsteinian view have been found.

Mass-Energy

Another consequence of Einstein's theory of special relativity (see above) is that mass must be viewed as a highly concentrated form of energy. Einstein’s equation representing this is the famous e = mc?, where e is energy, m is mass, and ¢ is the speed of light. The speed of light is so huge that to square it and multiply it by even a small amount of mass is to represent a large amount of energy (1 gram of mass equals 900 billion billion ergs of energy),

Whenever any process gives off energy, it loses a little mass; when it absorbs energy, it gains a little mass. The amount of mass lost or gained under ordinary conditions is so minute it had never been detected. That is why Lavoisier could consider mass conserved independently of energy (see 1769) and Helmholtz could consider energy conserved independently of mass (see 1847).

With the study of radioactivity, much larger energy changes per unit mass

were involved, as Pierre Curie had found (see 1901). Mass-energy equivalence could then be measured and was found to be precisely as Einstein's theory required it to be. The law of conservation of energy was thus extended and made more precise by the inclusion of mass as one more form of energy. The law of conservation of mass became obsolete, or rather, was included in what is sometimes known as the law of conservation of massenergy.

1905,Photoelectric Effect and Quanta,"['Einstein', 'Einstein Einstein', 'Newton', 'Huygens']","['Lenard', 'Planck']","In 1905 the photoelectric effect, as observed by Lenard (see 1902), was combined with quantum theory (see 1900) by Einstein.

He showed that if light consisted of quanta, with energies proportional to frequency (inversely proportional to wavelength), then the atoms in a metal surface could only absorb intact quanta. Furthermore, long-wavelength quanta would not supply enough energy to eject an electron from the metal, no matter how intense the light might be. But as wavelength grew shorter, energy quanta grew larger, and a point would be reached where  the energy was just sufficient to eject an electron. The shorter the wavelength beyond that, the more energetic the ejected electron would be and the more speedily it would travel. Since some metals may hold electrons more firmly than others, the critical wavelength must be shorter in some cases than in others.

Einstein’s analysis had several consequences.

1. It explained the photeelectric effect completely. There have not had to be any extensions or additions to the explanation since.

2. It made use of quantum theory to explain a phenomenon unexplainable otherwise, and a phenomenon moreover that had not been in Planck’s mind when he worked out the theory. If quantum theory were simply a mathematical device needed to make black-body radiation come out right, it wouldn't be likely to be applicable without modification to an altogether different phenomenon. Einstein's work therefore established quantum theory as legitimate and not merely a mathematical trick.

3. It showed that light could be treated as particles in some respects. Newton's particles and Huygens's waves (see 1678) were thus combined into a

whole that was far more complex and useful than could have been imagined on the basis of seventeenthcentury knowledge. The particle aspects of light, and of electromagnetic radiation generally, are referred to nowadays as photons.

It was for this work on the photoelectric effect (not on his still greater discoveries in connection with relativity) that Einstein gained a Nobel Prize in physics in 15217

1905,Brownian Motion and Atomic Size,"['Brown', 'Einstein', 'Einstein Einstein']","['Brownian', 'Swedish']","Brownian motion had remained somewhat of a puzzle since Brown had discovered it (see 1827). In 1902 the Swedish chemist Theodor Svedberg (1884— 1971) had suggested that the unequal bombardment of small particles by molecules from all sides impelled them to move randomly, this way and that.

Einstein, in 1905, analyzed the possibility of molecular bombardment thoroughly. He reasoned that any sizable object immersed in water (or any fluid) is bombarded from all sides, and surely more from one side at one moment and more from an-

other side at another moment. However, the countless trillions of molecules involved means that any small differences will be so small as to be indetectable.

If we consider a smaller and smaller object, the total number of molecules striking it at a given moment will be smaller, and little deviations will loom larger. By the time objects approach the microscopic in size, an additional molecule from this side or that should be sufficient to give it a noticeable push in this direction or that.

Einstein worked out an equation to describe Brownian motion, one from which it was possible to work out the size of molecules and of the atoms making them up, provided one found a way to measure certain other variables that occur in the equation.

It was not long before Einstein’s equation was put to good use.

1905,Color and Stellar Luminosity,"['Ejnar Hertzsprung', 'Hertzsprung']",['Danish'],"We all know that some stars are brighter than others; astronomers measure that brightness as maguitude. A star can appear bright for either of two reasons. It may radiate a large

amount of light (be of high luminosity), or it may be unusually close to us so that it appears bright even though it has low luminosity.

The Danish astronomer Ejnar Hertzsprung (1873— 1967) suggested that if a star's distance were known, one could calculate what magnitude it would have if it were some standard distance away. The distance chosen was 10 parsecs, or 32.6 light-years. The brightness of the star at that distance would then be its absolute magnitude. Thus, if our Sun were 10 parsecs away from us, it would seem to have a magnitude of 4.86 (a rather dim star), and that would be its absolute magnitude.

In studying the absolute magnitude of various stars, Hertzsprung could calculate their relative luminosities. In 1905 he noticed that there were two kinds of red stars: red stars with very high luminosity (which we now call red giants) and red stars with very low luminosity (which we now call red dwarfs).

The most interesting aspect of the findings was that there were no red stars of intermediate luminosity. Hertzsprung's report did not atiract much attention at first (he published it in a journal of photography),

but it represented the first step toward understanding the evolution of stars.

1905,Planetesimal Hypothesis,"['Laplace', 'Jupiter', 'Thomas Chrowder Chamberlin', 'Forest Ray Moulton', 'Chamberlin']",['American'],"Laplace’s nebular hypothesis of the origin of the Solar System (see 1796) had held sway for a century, even though astronomers had grown steadily more dubious about it. It turned out that most of the angular momentum in the Solar System was concentrated in the planets. (Jupiter alone has 60 percent of all the angular momentum in the Solar System because of its rapid rotation and the whirling of its major satellites.) There seemed no way in which the Solar System could have been formed by the slow condensation of a vast nebula without virtually all the angular momentum ending up at the core —in the body that became the Sun.

Despite this concern, no alternate hypothesis was advanced till the American geologist Thomas Chrowder Chamberlin (1843-1928) and the American astronomer Forest Ray Moulton (1872-1952) came along with one.

Chamberlin had been working on it since 1900 and, in 1905, he and Moul-

ton advanced the suggestion that the Solar System began when the Sun, already in existence, passed near another star. The gravitational influence of each star tore gouts of matter out of the other, and the gravitational pulls of the stars as they separated

gave those gouts of matter a sidewise yank so that they became planets with high angular momentum.

In the process of planet formation, the gouts of solar matter condensed into small solid pieces called planetesimals, and these came together little by little to form planets. This planetesimal hypothesis retained a certain popularity for nearly half a century.

If it were true, it would mean that there were very few planetary systems in the Universe, since the close approach of two stars is an excessively rare phenomenon.

1905,Metabolic Intermediates,"['Harden', 'Harden Harden']",['Harden'],"Harden, who had demonstrated the existence of coenzymes the year before (see 1904), continued to study the behavior of yeast enzyme on the fermentation of glucose. The enzyme breaks down glucose rapidly at first and produces

carbon dioxide, but as time goes on, the level of activity drops off. The natural assumption was that the enzyme broke down with time.

In 1905, however, Harden showed that this could not be so. If he added inorganic phosphate to the solution, the enzyme went back to work as hard as ever. This was a strange finding, for neither the sugar being fermented, nor the alcohol and carbon dioxide produced, nor the enzyme itself contained phosphorus.

Since the inorganic phosphate disappeared, Harden searched for some organic phosphate formed from it, which he located in the form of a sugar molecule to which two phosphate groups had become attached. This sugar phosphate was formed in the course of fermentation; then, after other reactions had taken place, the phosphate groups were removed again. The sugar phosphate was a metabolic intermediate. Harden was the first to isolate such a metabolic intermediate, but other biochemists were soon hot on the trail of such things.

Harden was also the first to indicate the important role that phosphate groups play in metabolism. For this work, he was

awarded a share of the Nobel Prize in chemistry in 1929.

1905,Hormones,[],[],"Starling, who had shared in the discovery of secretin (see 1902), suggested the name hormone in 1905. He also suggested that other hormones would be found to exist and that they were produced by various small glands in the body. In this he proved to be quite correct.

1905,Linkage of Characteristics,"['Mendel', 'Sutton', 'Mendel Bateson']",[],"When Mendel had studied his pea plants (see 1865), he had followed the course of seven characteristics and found them all to be inherited independently. It was natural to suppose, therefore, that every characteristic had its own factors, which all reached the fertilized egg cell independently. ‘When Sutton pointed out that the chromosomes were Mendel’s factors, however (see 1902), there was a problem: there weren't enough different chromosomes to account for all inherited characteristics. Bateson, who first applied the laws of heredity to animals (see 1902), pointed out that indeed not

all characteristics were independently inherited— some were transmitted together—so it might be supposed that a single chromosome contained more than one factor, perhaps many more than one factor. It might be that Mendel, by pure chance, had chosen seven factors that were each on a different chromosome.

The thought that a chromosome was not a factor but a collection of factors was a crucial one in the development of genetics. (It was Bateson, incidentally, who introduced the term genetics.)

1905,High Pressure,['Percy Williams Bridgman'],['American'],"Quite early, human beings learned how to produce temperatures considerably higher than normal. Producing high pressures was a more difficult task.

The American physicist Percy Williams Bridgman (1882—-1961), while a doctoral student, wanted to work with high pressures but found his equipment inadequate. In 1905, therefore, he turned to the problem of devising better high-pressure apparatus. He designed seals that squeezed more tightly together as the pressure increased so that there would be no leakage, and he

quickly attained pressures equal to 20,000 atmospheres (128 tons to the square inch).

This opened up the realm of truly high pressures to investigation.

1905,Intelligence Quotient,"['Alfred Binet', 'Binet']","['French', 'Paris']","While abnormal psychological phenomena have long interested physicians and scientists, the normal manifestations of the mind were what interested the French psychologist Alfred Binet (1857—1911).

He strove to devise

tests that would measure the ability of the human mind to think and reason, independently of learning and education in one field or another.

To do this, he asked children to name objects, follow commands, rearrange disordered things, copy designs, and so on. In 1905 he and his associates published the first batteries of tests designed to measure intelligence.

Standards were set empirically. If a particular test was passed by some 70 percent or so of the nine-yearolds in the Paris school system, then it represented the

nine-year-old level of intelligence.

The phrase intelligence quotient (often abbreviated 1Q) became popular. It represents the ratio of the mental age to the chronological age, with 100 considered average. Thus, a six-year-old who can pass a ten-yearold’s test has an IQ of 10/6 X 100, or 167.

Binet's initial efforts gave rise to batteries of tests designed to measure personalities, attitudes, aptitudes, and potentialities as well as intelligence— and their value is almost certainly overestimated.  1906

1905,Radio Waves and Sound,['Reginald Aubrey Fessenden'],"['Radio', 'American', 'Massachusetts']","Radio communication first came into use only as a wireless telegraph, forming the dots and dashes of the Morse code in appropriate bursts of radio waves.

It occurred to the Canadian-born American physicist Reginald Aubrey Fessenden (1866—1932) to send out a continuous signal with an amplitude (the height of the waves) varying in such a way as to follow the irregularities of sound waves. The radio wave was said to have amplitude modulation (AM) imposed on it.

At the receiving end, the modulation could be reconverted into sound waves, with the result that you could use a radio for speaking and hearing thanks to modulated radio waves the same way you could use a telephone for speaking and hearing thanks to modulated electric currents.

On December 24, 1906, the first such message was sent out from the Massachusetts coast, and wireless receivers picked up music.

1905,Triode,"['Lee De Forest', 'Radio', 'Fessenden']",['American'],"The rectifying diode worked out by Fleming (see 1904) was a useful tool but limited in its range. That range was extended in 1906 by the American inventor Lee De Forest (1873-1961). He inserted a third element, called a grid, into the tube to make it a triode (three electrodes).

The grid is an electrode with holes in it, so that electrons can move from the hot filament through the holes of the grid to the plate. Even a weak charge placed on the grid can have a relatively enormous effect on the electron current. It can increase the intensity of the current if the grid is slightly positively charged, since it then attracts electrons from the heated filament; and it can decrease the intensity if slightly negatively charged, since it then repels electrons. By placing a small varying charge on the grid, you get a much larger variation in the electron flow.

A triode therefore acts as an amplifier, and it can be modified to perform a great variety of tasks. Radio became more than

ever adapted to the transmission of sound through Fessenden's modulation (see above).

"
1905,Trojan Asteroids,"['Wolf', 'Wolf Jupiter', 'Jupiter', 'Wolf Achilles', 'Homer', 'Iliad']","['Lagrange', 'Witt', 'Trojan']","By 1906, no fewer than 587 asteroids had been spotted (thanks to Wolf’s photographic technique—see 1891) and had their orbits calculated.

In 1906 Wolf discovered an asteroid that moved unusually slowly and must therefore be unusually distant. In fact it moved in Jupiter’s orbit at the outer extreme of the asteroid belt, keeping step with Jupiter at a distance of 60 degrees.

This meant that the Sun, Jupiter, and the new asteroid were located at the vertices of a vast equilateral triangle. Lagrange (see 1788) had shown back in 1772 that such an arrangement was gravitationally stable, but this was the first case of such a gravitational triangle that had been actually found in space.

Wolf named the asteroid Achilles, after the hero of Homer’s Iliad, the tale of

the Trojan War. In giving an asteroid with an unusual orbit a masculine name, he followed the precedent of Witt (see 1898).

Other asteroids were eventually discovered that accompanied Achilles in its triangular position, and still others at a point 60 degrees from Jupiter in the other direction, so that there were two equilateral triangles adjacent to each other. All were named after various heroes of the Trojan War, so that they could be lumped together as the Trojan asteroids. The position at the third apex of a triangle where the other two are occupied by larger bodies is now called the Trojan position.

"
1905,Alpha Particles,"['Later Rutherford', 'Rutherford', 'Characteristic X Rays', 'Charles Glover Barkla', 'Barkla']","['German', 'British']","By now it was understood that beta rays were streams of speeding electrons (beta particles), while gamma rays were electromagnetic radiation of still shorter wavelength and higher frequency than X rays, The nature of the alpha particles that made up the alpha rays remained to be determined.

In 1906 Rutherford (see 1897), working with a German assistant, Johannes Hans Wilhelm Geiger (1882—1945), managed to determine the ratio of the electric charge to the mass

in the case of the alpha particles. This ratio turned out to be equal to that in a helium atom from which two electrons had been removed.

Later Rutherford fired alpha particles at a double wall of glass with a vacuum between. The alpha particles had energy enough to penetrate the first partition but, in the process of penetration, lost so much energy that they were unable to penetrate the second. They therefore remained in the vacuum between, and after enough had accumulated, Rutherford found that the thin gas that had appeared in the vacuum was indeed helium, judging from the spectrum.

Alpha particles and helium were thus related, but not identical. After all, streams of helium atoms would not penetrate glass.

Characteristic X Rays

X rays had been discovered eleven years earlier and were still of profound interest to physicists. The British physicist Charles Glover Barkla (1877—-1944) studied the manner in which X rays were scattered by gases and found that the higher the molecular weight of the gas, the greater the scatter-

ing of the X rays. From this he deduced, in 1904, that the more massive the atoms and molecules, the more charged particles they contained, since it was the charged particles that did the scattering. This was the first indication of a connection between the number of charged particles in an atom and its position in the periodic table.

He further showed, from the manner of scattering, that X rays were transverse waves like light, not longitudinal waves like sound, This was the final proof that they were examples of electromagnetic radiation.

In 1906 Barkla went on to something still more important. He showed that when X rays were scattered by particular elements, they produced a beam with a particular degree of penetration. The higher the atomic weight of an element, the more penetrating the characteristic X rays they produced. He went on to describe two types of such X rays: the more penetrating he called K radiation and the less penetrating he called L radiation.

At the time it was difficult to know what to make of this, but before long, characteristic X rays were to be important in rationalizing the periodic table.  For his work on X rays, Barkla was awarded the Nobel Prize in physics in 1917.

1905,Third Law of Thermodynamics,"['Dewar', 'Walther Hermann Nernst', 'Nernst']",['German'],"By now, temperatures as low as 14 degrees above absolute zero had been reached with Dewar’s solid hydrogen (see 1898). It seemed that the race to reach absolute zero might be soon completed.

In 1906, however, the German physical chemist Walther Hermann Nernst (1864—1941) advanced thermodynamic reasons for supposing that absolute zero could not be reached by any technique. He proposed that, like the speed of light in a vacuum, absolute zero was a limit that could be approached more and more closely but never actually reached. This is sometimes called the third law of thermodynamics, and for this Nernst was awarded the Nobel Prize in chemistry in 1920.

Hopkins (see 1900) was convinced that various organic compounds were present in the diet that were essential to life but needed only in tiny quantities. In 1906 he made this point in a lecture and suggested that scurvy and rickets were two diseases that arose through the lack of trace substances.

When these trace substances became known as vitamins a few years later, Hopkins was given credit for having helped give rise to the vitamin concept, so that he and Eijkman shared the Nobel Prize in medicine and physiology in 1929.

1905,Magnesium and Chlorophyll,"['Pelletier', 'Richard Willstatter', 'Willstatter']",['German'],"Ever since Pelletier discovered chlorophyll (see 1817), it had been understood that the substance was of the utmost importance. After all, it brought about the production of food and oxygen on which animal life, including human beings, subsisted. The chemical structure of chlorophyll was therefore of devouring interest to biochemists, but it was still poorly understood for all that.

The German chemist Richard Willstatter (1872— 1942), however, managed

to supply a key item of information about chlorophyll structure in 1906. He showed that each chlorophyll molecule contained a magnesium atom, held in much the same way that an iron atom was held by hemoglobin.

For this and for other work on planet pigments, Willstatter was awarded the Nobel Prize for chemistry in 1915.

1905,Chromatography,"['Mikhail Semenovich Tsvett', 'Tsvett', 'Chromatography']","['Russian', 'Greek']","The Russian botanist Mikhail Semenovich Tsvett (1872—-1919) worked with plant pigments, which are made up of a large number of rather similar organic compounds, difficult to separate into individual substances that can be studied singly. (This is a difficulty that frequently arises in biochemistry.)

In 1906 Tsvett found a convenient means of separation. He let a solution of a mixture of the pigments trickle down a tube of powdered aluminum oxide. The different substances in the pigment mixture held onto the surface of the powder particles but with different degrees of strength. As the mixture was washed downward, the substances began to separate, those holding with less strength being washed down farther.

If the tube of alumi num oxide was long enough, the substances in the mixture would be completely separated by the bottom of the column, and they would be washed out individually. The separation could be judged by the appearance of different shades of color on the columpn, so the technique was called chromatography, from Greek words meaning “writing in color.” The name was retained even in the case of mixtures of colorless substances. Chromatography, modified in many ways, became one of the most important techniques for the study of complex mixtures.

1907,Radioactivity and Earth,"['Clarence Edward Dutton', 'Earth', 'Earth Dutton', 'Atomic Change', 'Radioactive Series', 'Bertram Borden Boltwood', 'Hutton', 'Earth Boltwood']",['American'],"In 1906 the American geologist Clarence Edward Dutton (1841-1912) suggested that pockets of radioactivity in the Earth's crust delivered enough heat over time to activate volcanic action.

This was the beginning of the understanding that radioactivity added substantial heat to the Earth’s crust, enough to balance that lost by radiation, so that any attempt to judge the Earth’s age by calculating the time it took Earth to “cool down” from an ini-

tial high temperature was far off base. Earth could be billions of years old and still retain a heated interior.

Dutton also developed methods for determining the depth of earthquake origins and the velocity with which earthquake waves traveled through the Earth. This opened the way for a technique that finally offered strong evidence concerning the physical and chemical nature of the Earth’s deep interior.

® o Radioactive

. Dating Once it was understood that radioactivity involved the change of uranium or thorium to some other ra-

dioactive atom, which then broke down into still another, and so on (see 1900, Atomic Change, and 1902, Radioactive Series), the question that naturally arose was, Where did it all end?

The American chemist Bertram Borden Boltwood (1870-1927) was convinced that lead was the final product of the radioactive series that began with uranium and thorium. As early as 1905 he had noted that lead  was always present in uranium and thorium ores. In 1907 he pointed out that from the quantity of lead in uranium ores and from the known rate of uranium disintegration, it might be possible to determine with reasonable accuracy how long a portion of the Earth’s crust had been solid and had existed essentially undisturbed.

It had been about a century and a quarter since Hutton had said that he saw no sign of a beginning to Earth’s history (see 1785), but now at last radioactive dating looked like a technique that might yield such a sign. Boltwood's suggestion has born fruit ever since.

Up to this point, thirteen elements had been isolated from the rare earth minerals, which might have exhausted the supply, but there turned out to be room for another. In 1907 the French chemist Georges Urbain (1872-1938) discovered a fourteenth and named it lutetium, from an old name for the Roman town that had stood on the site of what is now Paris.

1907,Synthetic Peptides,['Fischer'],['Greek'],"It was well known that protein molecules were built up out of amino acids, but it was not known in just what manner those amino acids connected with each other. It seemed most likely that the amino group of one amino acid combined with the acid group of another, but that was not certain.

In 1907, however, Fischer, who had determined the structure of sugar molecules (see 1884), combined amino acids by chemical techniques that insured a combination between the amino group of one amino acid and the acid group of the next. He continued this until he had built up a chain consisting of eighteen amino acids.

He compared such a chain with those resulting from the breakdown of protein molecules by digestive enzymes. The fragments of a protein molecule so obtained are called peptides, from the Greek word for “to digest.” Fischer found that his synthetic peptides matched the properties of the natural peptides obtained from protein in all important ways. Indeed, the synthetic peptides could also be broken down by digestive enzymes.

The basic structure of the protein molecule was thus known. What remained was to determine the precise order of amino acids in given protein molecules, but that was not to happen for another halfcentury.

1907,Chemotherapy,"['Paul Ehrlich', 'Ehrlich', 'Trypan', 'Trypan Ehrlich']","['German', 'Flemming']","The medieval alchemists had attempted to cure disease by the use of various chemicals. They were not truly successhul (except occasionally by accident), because they did not know the

. cause of disease and had no

way of testing particular chemicals in a rational manner before using them. Their techniques were largely abandoned, therefore.

The German bacteriologist Paul Ehrlich (1854— 1915) returned to the notion of chemical cures (he coined the word chemotherapy in this connection) on a much more knowledgeable basis. It was understood, thanks to the work of Flemming (see 1882), that synthetic dyes could combine with some parts of cells and not others and could more markedly affect some cells than ethers. It occurred to Ehrlich that if a dye could be found that combined with some pathogenic organism but not

with human cells, it would be a “magic bullet” that could kill the pathogen while leaving the human patient largely unaffected.

By 1907 he had located a dye called Trypan red that combined with and killed trypanosomes, a type of protozoa that caused sleeping sickness. Trypan red was therefore a possible cure for the disease.

This development of chemotherapy earned Ehrlich a share of the Nobel Prize in physiology and medicine in 1908.

However, animals are much harder to work with on the whole than plants are.

In 1907, however, the American geneticist Thomas Hunt Morgan (1866—-1945) began to use a tiny insect called Drosophila, or fruit fly. They have only four chromosome pairs in each cell, are simple to feed, and breed readily and copiously at brief intervals.

In studying them, Morgan found that there were characteristics that were linked and inherited to-

gether, but that the linkage was not necessarily permanent, Every once in a while, two characteristics that had previously been inherited together were suddenly inherited independently. He was able to correlate this with the fact that chromosomes sometimes interchanged parts so that two characteristics ordinarily on the same chromosome came to be on different chromosomes.

Fruit fly research greatly hastened the pace at which knowledge of genetic mechanisms increased. For his work with them, Morgan was awarded the Nobel Prize for medicine and physiology in 1933.

In this way, it might be possible to study the growth, development, and functioning of cells, as well as changes in their organization. Eventually, this technique offered a method for the cultivation and study of microorganisms that would not grow on grosser, simpler media.

The first to culture tissues successfully was an

American zoologist, Ross Granville Harrison (1870— 1959). He cultivated tadpole tissue and found that nerve fibers grew from it. He was able to study the protoplasmic movements within the fibers, and this served as the foundation for later studies on nerve physiology.

1908,Conditioned Response,"['Thus', 'Einstein', 'Einstein Hermann Minkowski', 'Tinze']","['Pavlov', 'German', 'Space']","Salivation at the sight of food is an unconditioned response. It is brought about by the construction of the nerve network with which the organism is born. In 1907 Pavlov (see 1902) began an attempt to see if he could impose a new pattern upon such inborn ones,

Thus, a hungry dog that is shown food will salivate. If a bell is made to ring every time the dog is shown food, the dog will eventually salivate when the bell rings even when food is not shown. The dog has associated the sound of the bell with the sight of food and reacts to the first as though it were the second. This is a conditioned response.

Studies of the conditioned response led to the thought that a good part of learning and of the development of behavor is the  result of conditioned responses of all sorts picked up in the course of life.

Space-Time

Einstein's theory of special relativity (see 1905) forced many physicists to reconsider their view of the Universe. It was clear from Einstein's work that an ordinary three-dimensional view of the Universe was insufficient.

The Russian-born German mathematician Hermann Minkowski (1864— 1909) published Tinze and Space in 1907. In it he demonstrated that relativity made it necessary to take time into account as a kind of fourth dimension (treated mathematically somewhat differently from the three spatial dimensions). Neither space nor time had existed separately, in Minkowski's

view, so that the Universe consisted of a fused spacetime

Einstein adopted this notion as he continued to work on his theories. He was trying to extend them to accelerated motion in order to take gravitational interactions into account.

For the first time, the approximate size of atoms could be deduced from an actual observation. Atoms, it turned out, are about a hundred-millionth of a centimeter in diameter. In other words, 250,000,000 of them, lined up side by side, would stretch about an inch.

This was the final demonstration of the real existence of atoms. They were not merely a convenient hypothesis designed to make chemical calculations easier.

In 1908 the Dutch physicist Heike Kamerlingh Onnes (1853-1926) set about the task of liquetying helium. He built an elaborate device that would cool helium intensively by means of evaporating liguid hydrogen. When the helium had reached a very low temperature under compressed conditions, it would be allowed to expand so that it would cool still further.

In this way, liquid helium was finally collected in a flask set within a larger flask of liquid hydrogen, which was in turn contained in a still larger flask

of liquid air—so that the liquid helium would gain heat and vaporize only very slowly.

It turned out that helium liquefied at a temperature of only 4 degrees above absolute zero. By allowing some of it to evaporate, Kamerlingh Onnes reached a temperature of only 0.8 degrees above absolute zero, but even then he could not solidify it.

For his liquefaction of helium, Kamerlingh Onnes was awarded the Nobel Prize in physics in 1913.

His labors were made easier by the invention of a device to detect and, eventually, record such particles.

The invention was that of his assistant, Geiger (see 1906), who in 1908 produced the first rather primitive version of his device. Essentially, it was a cylinder containing a gas under a high electric potential, but one not quite high enough to overcome the resistance of the gas and set up a spark of discharge.

If a high-energy sub-

atomic particle entered, it would rip some of the electrons off a gas molecule, and what was left of the molecule would be a positively charged ion, which would be pulled toward the negatively charged cathode with great energy. In the process, as a result of collisions, the ion would produce further ions, each of which would do the same. In short, a single subatomic particle, on entering, would set off an avalanche of ionization, producing a momentary electric discharge, which could be arranged to make a clicking sound. The clicking of such a Geiger counter gives us information that our senses cannot give us.

Apparently it lacked some essential components of life, and like a virus, could only grow inside a cell, where it could make use of the cellular machinery to eke out its own deficiencies.

These agents, which came to be called rickettsia, in honor of the discoverer, were therefore intermediate between viruses and bacteria.

1908,Assembly Line,"['Henry Ford', 'Ford']",['American'],"During the first twenty years of its existence, the automobile had been improved greatly and manu-

factured in greater numbers. It remained very largely a toy of the rich, however, rather as yachts are today.

The man who changed that was the American industrialist Henry Ford (1863—1947). He had built his first automobile in 1893 and started a car-manufacturing company in 1899. His aim was to produce cars in quantity (mass production) and to make them cheaply enough to put them within reach of middle-class Americans.

His key innovation came in 1908, when he thought of dividing the manufacture of cars into steps, each of which could be performed simply by a single worker. He then placed the future car on a moving belt that brought it to different workers in succession, each of whom performed the assigned task over and over, with all necessary tools and parts within reach. What started at one end of the assembly line was a mere skeleton of a car, What rolled off the other end was a complete, functioning automobile, including a gasoline supply so that it could be driven away.

Ford produced a series of models identified by letters of the alphabet and finally considered the Model T suitable for mass-produc-

tion. It cost only $950 to begin with, but the price dropped in succeeding years, eventually reaching a low of $290. For the first time, the average man could afford to buy a car, and the automobile age— still in full swing today— began.

1908,Haber Process,"['Hellriegel', 'Great Britain', 'Fritz Haber', 'Syphilis Ehrlich', 'Ehrlich', 'Ehrlich Syphilis', 'Arsphenamine']","['Nitrogen', 'Germany', 'British', 'Chilean', 'Germany Germany', 'German', 'German Germany', 'England', 'France']","Nitrogen is absolutely essential to life, and also to explosives. Hellriegel had discovered that leguminous plants could fix atmospheric nitrogen and keep soil fertile (see 1886), but that was a slow process and would not suffice for the manufacture of explosives in the quantities that a war economy required. Nitrogen in its most usable form exists in nature as nitrates in the soil. Nitrates are therefore sought after, both for fertilizers and for explosives. Nitrates, however, are uniformly soluble and tend to be leached out of the soil by rainfall. One can therefore expect a reliable source of nitrates to be found chiefly in desert areas such as those in northern Chile. Germany, anticipating possible war with Great Britain, knew that British control of the seas would prevent Chilean nitrates from reaching Germany, reducing Germany's ability  to fight a long war. German chemists were therefore encouraged to find an alternate source for nitrates.

The German chemist Fritz Haber (1868—1934) sought a way of fixing atmospheric nitrogen in the laboratory. He found that if he placed a mixture of nitrogen and hydrogen under high pressure, in the presence of iron as a catalyst, he could manufacture ammonia. From ammonia, it was easy to obtain nitrates. By 1908 he had perfected the method and provided a source of home-grown (so to speak) affordable nitrates.

This Haber process made it possible for Germany to fight long wars— unfortunately.  1909

sge Syphilis Ehrlich had won a Nobel Prize for finding a chemical that would kill trypanosomes and might therefore serve as a cure for sleeping sickness (see 1907). The chemical invelved contained nitrogen, and it occurred to Ehrlich that if the similar but much more poisonous element arsenic were substituted for the nitrogen, it might prove a more effective chemotherapeutic agent.

He tried every organic arsenic compound he could obtain or synthesize, and the 606th was a compound now called arsphenamine. It did not seem unusually promising as an agent against trypanosomes, but in 1909 an assistant of Ehrlich found that it was effective against spirochetes, the agents that caused syphilis.

Syphilis had been a dreaded disease for four centuries, all the more so since it was spread by sexual activity so that it was considered shameful and could not be mentioned in polite society. Naturally, that just multiplied its incidence.

Arsphenamine cut

down the incidence of syphilis by half in England and France over the next five years, but bluenoses were not wanting who thought it a wicked invention because it encouraged “immorality” by lessening the fear of medical consequences.

1908,Typhus,['Nicolle'],"['Typhus', 'Tunis', 'French']","Typhus, a contagious disease with a high mortality rate, periodically struck in epidemic form.

In Tunis, a French physician, Charles-Jean-Henri Nicolle (1866—1936), noted that typhus was very contagious outside the hospital but not inside. Something must happen upon entrance to the hospital, and Nicolle wondered if it might be the fact that patients’ clothes were removed and that they were washed and put into clean hospital garments.

Nicolle decided that the contagious agent must be connected with the old clothes, and he suspected the body louse, which exists everywhere among human beings where the chance for frequent washing of clothes and body does not exist.

By 1909 he had proved the case. The body louse, by biting someone with typhus and then biting someone without it, spread the disease. This meant the disease could be controlled if some practical way could be found of removing the louse, in societies where for one reason or another washing was infrequent. That was not to come for another third of a century.

In 1909 the Russianborn American chemist Phoebus Aaron Theodore Levene (1869—-1940) extracted a sugar from nucleic acid and identified it as ribose. It had a fivecarbon molecule. Not all nucleic acid molecules possessed it, but those that did came to be known as ribose nucleic acid, almost invariably abbreviated as RNA.

The sugar, if any, in the

samples of nucleic acid that did not contain ribose was not identified for another twenty years.

The suggestion was adopted.

1908,Tungsten Wire,"['Edison', 'William David Coolidge', 'Light']",['American'],"When Edison introduced the electric light bulb (see 1879), he used carbon fibers as filaments. These were brittle, hard to handle, and didn't last long. Obviously some sort of metal wire would be better. However, it would have to be of a metal with a high melting point so that it could withstand white-hot temperatures, and such metals were for the most part expensive, hard to draw into wires, or both.

The metal with the highest melting point is tungsten, which melts at about 3410° C. It is not inor-

dinately expensive, but it is brittle. In 1909, however, the American physicist William David Coolidge (18731975) managed to perfect a method of drawing tungsten into fine wires.

As a result, tungsten filaments became universal in light bulbs, radio tubes, and other devices. Light bulbs lasted for considerably longer before having to be replaced, therefore, though further improvements remained to be made.

The real beginning came with the work of a Belgian-born American chemist, Leo Hendrik Baekeland (1863-1944).

It often happened in organic chemistry that hard tarry residues fouled chemical equipment and then could not be removed. Baekeland tried to find some solvent that would remove them. For the purpose, he deliberately reacted phenol with formaldehyde to form such a residue, and then searched for

a solvent. He couldn’t find one.

It occurred to him that if the residue was so resistant to solvents, it might have a useful application in its own right as an inert, strong, and cheap material, so he began to concentrate on forming the resinous mass more efficiently and making it still harder and tougher. By using the proper heat and pressure, he obtained a liquid that solidified and took the shape of the container it was in. Once solid, it was hard, water-resistant, solventresistant, and an electrical insulator. Yet it could be cut without trouble and was easily machined.

In 1909 he brought this substance (which he named Babkelite, after himself) on the market. Bakelite was the first of the thermosetting plastics (one that once set will not soften under heat) and has been useful ever since, It sparked the modern development of plastics.

1908,Mohorovicic Discontinuity,['Andrija'],['Croatian'],"There was an earthquake in the Balkans in 1909, and a Croatian geologist, Andrija Mohorovic¢i¢ (1857—1936), studied the waves that traveled through the Earth’s  crust as a result. He found that waves that penetrated deeper into the Earth arrived sooner than waves traveling along the surface.

Mohorovi¢i¢ maintained that the Earth's outermost crust rested on a layer that was more rigid and in which earthquake waves therefore traveled more quickly. Furthermore, the separation between the two layers did not seem to be gradual but sharp. It was a discontinuity and came to be known as the Mohorovici¢ discontinuity.

This was the first indication that the Earth was composed of more than one layer, with widely different properties.

half centuries before, the North Pole had been a distant goal for explorers, but the ice defeated everyone until the early years of the twentieth century.

The American explorer Robert Edwin Peary (1856— 1920) made it his goal. Beginning in 1886, he began a detailed exploration of Greenland and in 1891 explored its northern coast (relatively ice-free and still called Peary Land in his honor). He proved that Greenland was an island that did not extend to the North Pole, although the northernmost bit of Greenland is closer to the pole than any other land area.

In 1909 Peary organized an elaborate travel party, of which successive members were to turn back at periodic intervals until at the end only Peary and his black associate, Mat-

thew Alexander Henson (1866—1955), reached the North Pole in a final dash on April 6, 1909.

There was some controversy over this. An erstwhile associate of Peary'’s, Frederick Albert Cook (1865—1940), claimed to have reached the Pole in 1908. The controversy has never been settled and perhaps never will be, but the general opinion is that it was Peary who first attained the goal.

1910,Neon Lights,"['Georges Claude', 'De Vries', 'Morgan']","['Erench', 'Ychromosome']","Beginning in 1910, the Erench chemist Georges

Claude (1870-1960) showed that electric discharges through the noble gases could be made to produce

light. Most spectacular was the red light produced in this manner by neon, so that light produced in this

manner by any gas came to be called neon lights.

The fact that tubes filled with neon or other gases could be twisted into any shape—so that they spelled out words, for instance—made it inevitable that they would replace ordinary incandescent bulbs in advertising signs.

Sex-Linked Characteristics

In 1910 Morgan, still working with fruit flies (see 1907), noted a white-eyed male fly among a mass of ordinary red-eyed ones. It was a mutation such as De Vries had observed among plants (see 1900).

Morgan crossed the white-eyed male with a red-eyed female, and all the offspring were red-eyed

(red was dominant). In the next generation, however, there were both red-eyed and white-eyed flies, and all the white-eyed ones were males.

This was the first observation of sex-linked characteristics. It meant that males and females had to be differentiated in chromosome makeup. The way they are is that not all the chromosomes make up perfect pairs. In the case of one of them, the female fruit fly did indeed have a pair (an X chromosome and an X chromosome), but the male had one normal chromeosome and a stub (an X chromosome and a Y chromosome). A white-eye gene on the female X chromosome could be overbalanced by a red-eye gene on the pair, but a white-eye gene on the male X chromo-

some had nothing to balance it on the Ychromosome stub.

The chromosome pairs of male and female human beings show a similar differentiation.

1911,Nuclear Atom,['Rutherford'],[],"For some years, Rutherford had been firing alpha particles at sheets of matter (see 1906), thinking that even if they could penetrate the matter, they might be deflected and scattered by the atoms making it up. From the manner of the deflection, Rutherford hoped to gain some knowledge of atomic structure.

In 1908, for instance, he fired alpha particles at a sheet of gold only 1/50,000 of an inch thick. Most of the alpha particles passed through, unaffected and undeflected, recording themselves on the photographic plate behind.

Since the gold represented a barrier that was two thousand atoms thick, the fact that alpha particles could pass through them all as though there were nothing there seemed to mean that atoms were mostly empty space. Yet some alpha particles were deflected, and struck the photographic plate some distance away from the central spot formed by the

main stream of alpha particles. Some were deflected through quite an angle.

This meant that part of the atom contained considerable mass. From the fact that so few alpha particles were deflected, it could be concluded that the part with the mass must make up a very small fraction of the atom.

By 1911 Rutherford had gathered enough evidence to put forward his theory of the nuclear atom. The atom, it would seem, has virtually all its mass squeezed into a tiny, positively charged atomic nucleus (which we now know is only 1/100,000 the diameter of the atom). The outer regions of the atom contain enough electrons, each with a unit negative charge, to neutralize the nuclear charge and leave the atom as a whole electrically neutral.

This theory was adopted quickly, for it answered major questions. For example, the relationship between alpha particles and helium was now understood. The alpha par-

ticles were helium nuclei, not helium atoms. This accounted for the electric charge of the alpha particle and, thanks to its subatomic size, for its penetrating power.

1911,Cloud Chamber,"['Charles Thomson Rees Wilson', 'Wilson', 'Wilson Wilson']","['Becquerel', 'Scottish']","Since the discovery of radioactivity by Becquerel (see 1896), the use of speeding subatomic particles had been increasing. This made it important to have devices that could yield information concerning them. The Geiger counter (see 1908) could detect their presence, but more was needed.

A Scottish physicist, Charles Thomson Rees Wilson (1869-1959), had been studying clouds and labored to produce small artificial clouds in the laboratory that he could also study

In 1896 he had allowed moist air to expand within a container so that the expansion lowered the temperature and not all the moisture could be retained, the excess coming out as

water droplets to form a tiny cloud. In this way he determined that the presence of dust or of electrically charged ions encouraged the formation of water droplets and therefore of clouds.

It occurred to Wilson eventually that energetic radiation would produce ions as they spread through the atmosphere. If he could prepare air that was dustfree, he could make it so moist that water drops would only be kept from condensing by lack of the dust that would serve as condensation-seeds.

If an energetic particle then passed through the chamber, and if the chamber was expanded, droplets of water would form around the ions produced by the passage of the particle, and not only would the presence of the particle be detected but its route of travel as well. If the cloud chamber was then placed in a magnetic field, the curvature of the path of the particle would indicate the nature of its electric charge and give information concerning its mass. It would also indicate collisions of particles with molecules and with other particles and offer a guide to events that took place before and after the collision.

Wilson perfected his cloud chamber in 1911 and

it quickly became an important adjunct of nuclear research. For this work, Wilson was awarded a Nobel Prize in physics in 1927°

1911,Electron Charge,"['Thomson', 'Raobert Andrews Millikan', 'Millikan', 'Millikan Millikan']",['American'],"The ratio of the electric charge of the electron to its mass had been worked out and compared with that of ordinary ions by Thomson (see 1897). The size of the electric charge in an absolute sense, however, was not known.

The American physicist Raobert Andrews Millikan (1868-1953) tackled the job. Beginning in 1906, he had followed the course of tiny electrically charged water droplets falling through air, under the influence of gravity, against the pull of a charged plate above. The evaporation of the water confused the results, and in 1911 he began to use tiny oil droplets instead.

Every once in a while, such an oil droplet attached itself to an ion, which Millikan produced by passing X rays through the chamber. With the ion added, the effect of the charged plate above was suddenly strengthened and the droplet would fall more slowly or perhaps even rise. The minimum change in motion was due, Millikan

felt, to the addition of a single electronic charge. By balancing the effects of the electromagnetic attraction upward and the gravitational attraction downward, both before and after such an addition, Millikan was able to calculate the charge on a single electron. The figure we now have is sixteen-quintillionths of a coulomb.

For this work, Millikan was awarded the Nobel Prize in physics in 1923.

"
1911,Cosmic Rays,"['Victor Franz Hess', 'Millikan', 'Hess']",['Austrian'],"One way to detect the presence of energetic radiation is by the use of a gold-leaf electroscope. This device consists of two pieces of gold leaf, joined at the upper end, and contained in a sealed jar. They can be electrically charged from the outside, and since both leaves have the same charge, they repel each other, forming an inverted V. Any energetic radiation entering the jar produces ions, which will carry off the electric charge and allow the gold leaves to come together slowly. There seemed no way of keeping the leaves permanently apart, however, even in the absence of any known source of energetic radiation. Some radiation was apparently coming from an unknown source.

An Austrian physicist, Victor Franz Hess (1883— 1964), felt that the source must be somewhere in the ground, so in 1911 he took electroscopes up on balloon flights to get them out of range of the ground radiation.

He made ten flights and observed quite to his astonishment that the gold leaves came together up to eight times as rapidly at considerable heights as they did at ground level. The radiation seemed to be coming from above, after all—to be coming from outer space, from the cosmos generally. Millikan (see above) suggested, therefore, that the radiation be called cosmic rays, a name that stuck.

For his discovery, Hess was awarded a share of the Nobel Prize in physics in 1936.

1911,Superconductivity,['Kamerlingh'],['Onnes'],"Kamerlingh Onnes, having liquefied helium and obtained temperatures of 4 degrees above absolute zero (4° K) and even lower (see 1908), was eager to study the properties of matter at such exceedingly low temperatures.

For instance, it was known that metals tended to lessen their resistance to

an electric current as the temperature went down. It seemed to Kamerlingh Onnes that this lessening must continue all the way down to absolute zero, where it must disappear altogether.

He tested the matter on mercury, and resistance dropped more or less as expected till he reached a temperature of 4.2° K. There, to his surprise, the resistance dropped suddenly to zero.

This phenomenon—the perfect conductivity of an electric current at temperatures close to absolute zero —was called superconductivity. It was soon found that other metals (though not all) also showed the phenomenon, the resistance dropping to zero at some very low temperature that was characteristic for each metal.

mosome would separate them.

Morgan and his assistant, the American geneticist Alfred Henry Sturtevant (1891-1970), investigated the frequency of separation by crossover in an attempt to locate the genes governing particular characteristics on a chromosome. The first such chromosome map was presented in 1911.

He mashed up the tumor and passed it through a filter fine enough to keep out anything larger than a virus. To his surprise, he found that this filtrate was infectious and would produce tumors in

healthy chickens. He published the report in 1911, and the disease came to be called the Rous chicken sarcoma virus. It was the first of a family of tumor viruses.

It was as though there had been a smooth stretch of rock originally, which had cracked, with one side sliding along the other to produce a mismatch. The general feeling was that such faults were produced by earthquakes.

The American geologist Harry Fielding Reid (1859— 1944) studied the San Francisco earthquake and came to the conclusion, in 1911, that the reverse was true. The fault existed first, and the earthquake resulted when pressure upon the fault caused it to slip further.

This was a more difficult objective, for the South Pole was more distant from important population centers, and it was at the center of a landmass, so that it was considerably colder than the North Pole.

The Norwegian explorer Roald Amundsen (1872—1928) had already made his way by sea across the northern border of North America in 1903 (achieving the Northwest Passage at last). Now he prepared for a race to the South Pole.

In October 1911 he set off, with dogs (who could eat meat—and each

other, in case of need), reaching the South Pole on December 14 and returning safely.

The British explorer Robert Falcon Scott (1868— 1912) was also trying to reach the pole, but he didn’t plan his expedition as well. He ran into enormous misfortune, reached the South Pole a month after Amundsen did, and perished with his party on the way back.

Self-Starter

The automobile still had to be started manually by inserting a crank into the front of the car, where

it could grip the rotor

of the engine, forcing it

to turn and “catch.” That took a great effort, and sometimes when the engine caught, the crank began to turn at great speed, pulled out of the cranker’s hand, and broke his arms.

The American inventor Charles Franklin Kettering (1876-1958) invented an electric starter in 1911 that would do the job at the turn of a key. It was used in the 1912 Cadillac and quickly grew popular. With the crank gone, automobiles could be started and driven by far more people, which greatly spread the antomobile way of life.

1912,Cepheid Variables,"['Cepheus', 'Henrietta Swan Leavitt', 'Milky Way', 'Leavitt', 'Cepheid']","['American', 'Cepheid']","There is a group of variable stars in which the rise and fall of brightness follows a distinctive pattern, although the period—the time taken by one rise and fall—varies from star to star. These stars are called Cepheid variables because the first one discovered was in the constellation Cepheus.

The American astronomer Henrietta Swan Leavitt (1868—1921) was interested in Cepheid variables and studied a number of them in the Magellanic Clouds, two large groups of stars that lie beyond the Milky Way (see 1678).

Her observations, beginning in 1904, showed that the brighter the Cepheid, the longer the period. This fact was obscured among the stars nearer to us, because some Cepheids seem dim only because they are quite far away, while others seem bright

only because they are near. In the Magellanic Clouds, however, all the Cepheids are about the same distance from us, so that their apparent brightness reflects their real brightness, or luMInosity.

By 1912 Leavitt had worked out a method for determining the luminosity of a Cepheid variable from its period. Once its luminosity was known, its distance could be calculated from its apparent brightness. What was needed to make this method work was a reliable estimate, by some other method, of the absolute distance of at least one Cepheid variable. This was a knotty problem, for even the nearest Cepheid is too far away for its absolute distance to be determined easily.

Once this was accomplished, however, the Cepheid variables could be used as a yardstick to determine distances far greater than those that could be determined by the method of parallax (see 150 B.C.).

One thing that could be done was to study its spectrum and, from the position of its dark lines, see whether it was approaching us or receding from us. The American astronomer Vesto Melvin Slipher (1875-1969) made the measurement in 1912 and reported that it was approaching Earth at a speed of 125 miles per second.

This did not seem very important at the time, but Slipher went on to determine the radial velocities of other nebulae, and such results led, in the next de-

cade, to a revolution in our notions of the structure of the Universe.

In 1912 the German geologist Alfred Lothar Wegener (1880-1930) proposed that Africa and South America had indeed once formed a single landmass, which had broken in two, and that the two parts had then moved apart in a sort of continental drift.

In fact, he suggested that all the continents had originally formed a single mass (Pangaea, Greek for “all-earth”) surrounded by a continuous ocean (Panthalassa, Greek for “all-sea”).

This large granite mass of Pangaeca had broken into chunks that slowly separated, floating on a basalt ocean-floor, and over hundreds of millions of years, produced the pattern of fragmented continents that we now have.

Unfortunately, the notion of granite floating on basalt did not seem a tenable hypothesis, and on the whole, few people took Wegener's notions seriously at the time.

1912,X-Ray Diffraction,"['Barkla', 'Max Theodor Felix', 'Laue']",['German'],"Once Barkla had shown that X rays were electromagnetic radiation (see 1906), the question arose of what their wavelengths might be. The ordinary way of measuring the wave length of electromagnetic radiation was to pass that radiation through a fine grating. However, to measure very short wavelengths, very fine gratings were required, and no grating fine enough to measure wavelengths as short as those of X rays could be manufactured.

It occurred to a German physicist, Max Theodor Felix von Laue (1879-1960), that it was un-

:gsary to manufacture

-atings; nature had

already done the job. A crystal consisted of layers of atoms that were spaced just as regularly as, but far more closely than, the

ruled scratches of any grating. A beam of X rays aimed at a crystal ought then to be diffracted as ordinary light would be by an ordinary grating. The results would be complicated, because ordinary gratings consist simply of parallel lines, while crystals contain layers of atoms extending in various directions. Still, it could be done.

In 1912 Laue tried the experiment of passing X rays through a crystal of zine sulfide and recording the diffraction pattern on a photographic plate. It worked perfectly. It was clear that such a diffraction pattern could be used to calculate X-ray wavelengths, and that once the wavelengths were known, the technique could be used to study the fine structure of crystals.

For his work on X-ray diffraction, Laue was awarded the Nobel Prize for physics in 1914.

1912,Neon Varieties,"['Goldberg', 'Thomson']",['Thomson'],"Thomson (see 1897) found himself interested in the canal rays that Goldberg

had discovered a quartercentury earlier (see 1886). By 1912 it was clear that they were composed of positively charged subatomic particles, so Thomson called them positive rays. In the light of Rutherford’s nuclear atom (see 1911), the positive rays appeared to be streams of atomic nuclei.

In 1912 Thomson studied the manner in which positive rays were deflected by magnetic and electric fields. He balanced those helds in such a way that particles of different charge-to-mass ratio curved differently and fell in different spots on a photographic plate.

When he deflected streams of neon nuclei, he found to his surprise that they landed on two different spots, as though there were two varieties of neon atom that differed in charge, mass, or both. Observations such as this were soon to introduce new concepts of atomic structure that proved to be of the greatest importance.

1912,Dipole Moments,"['Peter Joseph William Debye', 'Debye', 'Casimir Funk', 'Funk', 'Latin']","['Dutch', 'Hopkins']","Now that it was understood that electrons formed part of atoms, it followed that

when atoms joined to form molecules, electrons ought to be distributed over the various atoms of the molecules.

Such distribution might be symmetrical, so that the molecule was electrically uncharged, or unsymmetrical, so that one part of the molecule might have a surplus of electrons and thus a slight negative charge while another part might have a deficit of electrons and a slight positive charge. These would represent positive and negative poles of the molecules, which would thus be polar molecules, or molecular dipoles.

Naturally, polar molecules and nonpolar molecules would act differently with respect to electric fields. In addition, polar molecules would attract each other, positive toward negative, and therefore have higher melting and boiling points than nonpolar molecules of similar size.

In 1912 a Dutch physical chemist, Peter Joseph William Debye (1884~ 1966), worked out a set of equations that would represent the behavior of such polar molecules. This gave rise to the concept of dipole moments and greatly helped chemists under stand the behavior of molecules.

For this work, Debye was awarded the Nobel Prize for chemistry in 1936.

1913,Isotopes,"['Frederick Soddy', 'Kasimir Fajans', 'Soddy', 'Soddy Soddy']","['British', 'Polish', 'Greek']","During the intense study of radioactive phenomena that had been going on for the previous seventeen years, some forty to fifty different elements had been reported (as judged by differences in radioactive properties—the kinds, intensities, and energies of particles emitted). However, there were only ten to twelve places available for them in the periodic table. Either the periodic table did not apply to radioactive elements or there was something subtle about those elements that had been missed.

The British chemist Frederick Soddy (1877— 1956) worked on the problem. He made clear what is now called the radioactive displacement law. (The Polish chemist Kasimir Fajans [1887—1975] made these same suggestions independently at about the same time.) When an atom gives off an alpha particle, the alpha particle has a positive charge of 2 and a mass of 4. The atom that gave it off therefore has to turn into another atom with a

smaller charge (by 2) on its nucleus and a smaller mass (by 4).

When a beta particle is given off, with a negative charge of 1, the loss of the negative charge is equivalent to the gain of a positive charge. An atom that gives off a beta particle therefore turns into another atom with a larger nuclear charge (by 1). Since an electron has only a tiny mass, the mass of an atom is virtually unchanged in betaparticle emission.

A gamma ray, having neither electric charge nor mass, does not affect the nature of an atom when given off; it merely decreases the atom’s energy content.

By following these changes, Soddy suggested that a given place in the periodic table might be occupied by two or more different substances, distinguishable from each other by their differing radioactive properties. These occupants of the same place would be equal in nuclear charge but different in mass. Soddy called them isotopes, from Greek words meaning “‘same place.”

For his advancement of

the isotope concept, Soddy was awarded the Nobel Prize for chemistry in 1921.

1913,Lead Isotopes,"['Soddy', 'William Richards', 'Richards']",['American'],"Soddy had worked out the isotope concept in connection with radioactive elements (see above), but

these were available in such tiny quantities that atomic weights could not be determined, and the existence of isotopes could not be checked in that way. However, the radioactive displacement law made it clear that uranium and thorium each broke down to a different isotope of lead, and that could be checked.

The American chemist Theodore William Richards (1868-1928) had worked out unprecedentedly accurate methods for determining atomic weights, and he used these methods to determine the atomic weight of lead obtained from ores containing uranium or thorium and those containing neither.

In 1913 Richards found definite variations in the atomic weight of lead, and this strongly supported the isotope concept. For his  work on atomic weights, Richards was awarded the Nobel Prize for chemistry in 1914.

1913,Quantized Atom,"['Rutherford', 'Niels Henrik David Bohr', 'Kirchhoff', 'Johann Jakob Balmer', 'Bohr', 'Bohr Bohr']","['Danish', 'Swiss']","Now that Rutherford had formulated the nuclear atom (see 1911), it was possible to view the hydrogen atom as consisting of a nucleus (bearing a charge of +1) and a single electron (with a charge of —1) circling it.

One could argue that the electron, as it circled the nucleus, in effect oscillated from side to side. This oscillation, according to Maxwell’s equations, should result in electromagnetic radiation. But if this were so, the electron would lose energy as it circled and would spiral into the nucleus.

The Danish physicist Niels Henrik David Bohr (1885-1962) tried to solve this problem by applying quantum theory to the atom. The electron, he decided, could not radiate energy except in intact quanta, each of which represented a large amount of energy on the atomic scale. Consequently the electron, when it radiated, would lose a large packet of en-

ergy and would not spiral into the nucleus gradually but drop very suddenty to a lower orbit nearer the nucleus. It would do this each time it radiated a quantum of energy. Eventually it would reach the lowest orbital state, below which it couldn’t fall, and it would then emit no more energy.

In reverse, if the atom absorbed energy, the electron would suddenly rise to a higher orbit, and this would continue with further absorption of energy until it left the atom altogether, at which time the atom would be ionized, becoming a fragment with a positive charge equal in size to the number of electrons that had been boiled off, so to speak.

As electrons rose to higher orbits and fell to lower orbits, they would radiate only certain wavelengths, and under other conditions, absorb those same wavelengths, as Kirchhoff had shown over half a century before (see 1859).

The presence of many electrons rising and falling in orbits might confuse the issue, but hydrogen, with its single electron, should be easier to handle. Indeed, hydrogen has a simple spectrum, giving off radiation at a series of wavelengths

=

that can be related to each other by a rather simple equation. This equation had been worked out by a Swiss physicist, Johann Jakob Balmer (1825-1898), in 1885. It had not seemed to have much significance at the time, but now Bohr could choose orbits for a hydrogen electron that would yield just those wavelengths that the hydrogen spectrum displayed.

Bohr's suggestion wasn't perfect. There were fine details of the hydrogen spectrum that it couldn’t account for. There was also no explanation of why the electron, when it was in a particular orbit and oscillating back and forth,

did not lose energy. If it couldn't give off an entire quantum, why didn't it stop oscillating?

Bohr's suggestion, however, was the first application of quantum theory to the atom and was enormously important for that reason, The imperfections were gradually removed in succeeding years, and for his work, Bohr was awarded the Nobel Prize for physics in 1922.

1913,Coolidge Tube,"['Whereas', 'Light Bulbs', 'Hot']","['Coolidge', 'American']","Coolidge, who had pioneered the use of tungsten filaments in electric light

bulbs (see 1909), made a further advance involving that metal in 1913: he used a block of tungsten as an anode in a cathode-ray tube to produce X rays. This increased the ease and efficiency with which X rays could be produced. Whereas hitherto X rays had been almost entirely a laboratory phenomenon, the new Coolidge tube made it possible to use them in industry, medicine, and dentistry.

Nitrogen-Filled Light Bulbs

Even with the use of Coolidge’s tungsten filaments (see above), light bulbs were not immortal. The high-melting tungsten very slowly vaporized at the temperatures required to produce adequate light. The filament thinned and eventually broke.

The American chemist Irving Langmuir (1881— 1957) argued that by keeping hot metal in a vacuum, vaporization was encouraged, but the presence of gas pressure would cut down the rate. Naturally, one couldn't use air, for then the tungsten would burn, but why not use pure nitrogen? Nitrogen-filled bulbs did indeed decrease

the rate of evaporation and provide longer-lasting light bulbs.

Eventually, argon was used in place of nitrogen. Hot tungsten reacted slowly even with nitrogen, but not at all with the just about totally inert argon. The use of gas in light bulbs was also a safety measure, If light bulbs were accidentally dropped, the breakage was not as shattering when there was gas pressure inside as when there was a vacuum.

some Cepheid variables. Once he had done this, he could make use of Leavitt's period-luminosity law, worked out the previous year (see 1912), to determine the distances of Cepheids in the Magellanic Clouds and therefore the distance of the Magellanic Clouds themselves. This distance proved to be something over 150,000 light-years.

This was the first distance to be determined for any object lying outside our own Milky Way Galaxy.

1914,Ozonosphere,"['Charles Fabry', 'Elmer Verner McCollum', 'McCollum', 'Lind', 'Leonor Michaelis', 'Maud Lenora Menten', 'Archibald Vivian Hill', 'Otto Meyerhof', 'Hill', 'Meyerhof']","['Earth', 'French', 'American', 'German', 'British', 'German Greek']","Although oxygen is a major component of Earth's atmosphere, the three-atom molecule ozone (see 1840) is not found in more than trace amounts in the air around us. That is just as well, of course, for it is poiSonous.

In 1913, however, the French physicist Charles Fabry (1867—1945) was able to demonstrate the presence of significant quantities of ozone in the upper atmosphere, between heights of 6 and 30 miles. This region is sometimes called the ozonosphere in consequence. There, the ozone is extremely useful, for it absorbs and blocks the more energetic ultravio let light from the Sun, which is dangerous to life, and keeps it from reaching the Earth’s surface.

Vitamins A and B

As research on vitamins continued, it became clear that there were several of them. The American biochemist Elmer Verner McCollum (1879-1967) found, in 1913, that there was some factor essential to life in some fats. It had to be fat-soluble, and this alone had to make its molecular structure considerably different from the trace substance, essential to life, that cured beriberi, since that was watersoluble.

In the absence of any real information about the molecular structure of these compounds, McCollum called them fat-soluble A and water-soluble B. Eventually, this was changed to vitamin A and vitamin B.

The use of letters has persisted, at least to some extent, ever since. For instance, the factor that Lind had unwittingly werked with in curing scurvy (see 1747) came to be called vitamin C and the one that prevented rickets was called vitamin D.

MichaelisMenten Equation

Although catalysts had been known and used for a century (even if we don’t count the prehistoric use of fermentation), the manner of their action remained unknown. In fact there seemed something almost magical about them. How could they hasten a chemical reaction and yet not take part in it themselves? How could enzymes, present in so small a quantity that no chemist knew what their molecular structure might be, so greatly hasten areaction?

The German chemist Leonor Michaelis (1875— 1949) and his assistant Maud Lenora Menten derived an equation that would deseribe the rate at which enzyme-catalyzed reactions took place. In order to do that, they supposed that the enzyme combined with the substance whose reaction it catalyzed and that after the reaction took place the two separated again.

This supposition allowed the Michaelis-Menten equation to be derived, which showed how the rate of reaction varied with the concentration of the sub-

stance undergoing the reaction. It seemed that enzymes and catalysts generally did take part in the reaction. The enzyme (or the catalyst, more usually) offered a surface to which the reactant could attach under circumstances that allowed it to undergo the reaction much more readily. To be metaphorical, the catalyst played the part of a hard flat surface in the writing of a note. It is difficult to write on a piece of paper in the air, but place the paper on a desk and writing is easy. The desk takes no part in the writing, but it does offer an appropriate surface. Catalysts began to lose their mystery.

o Glycolysis

The British physiologist Archibald Vivian Hill (1886— 1977) was particularly interested in the relationship between muscle contraction and heat development. To measure the small and transient heat effects, he made use of thermocouples, which swiftly and delicately recorded heat changes in the form of tiny electric currents. He refined his methods till he could measure a rise of threethousandths of a degree for a few hundredths of a second.

In 1913 he found that heat was not developed nor was oxygen consumed during muscular contraction, but that both took place after contraction when the muscle was at rest.

The German biochemist Otto Meyerhof (1884— 1951) independently demonstrated the same fact in chemical terms. While the muscle is contracting, gly-

cogen disappears and lactic acid appears. Six-carbon units, in other words, are split into three-carbon units without the consumption of oxygen or the development of heat. Eventually, accumulating lactic acid prevents further muscular contraction. (We feel worn out.) After the contraction, lactic acid is oxidized (consuming oxygen and devel-

oping heat), thus paying off the oxygen debt that piled up during the preceding reaction (anaerobic glycolysis, Greek for “‘sugar-splitting without air”).

As a result of this work, Hill and Meyerhof were awarded shares of the Nobel Prize for medicine and physiology in 1922.

1914,Atomic Number,"['Laue', 'Barkla', 'Henry Gwyn Jeffreys Moseley', 'Mendeleyey', 'Moseley', 'Moseley Moseley']",['British'],"Once Laue had shown that X rays could be diffracted by crystals (see 1912) and Barkla had shown that elements could be made to emit characteristic X rays (see 1906), it became possible to measure the wavelengths of those char-

acteristic X rays precisely by crystal diffraction.

This work was done by the British physicist Henry Gwyn Jeffreys Moseley (1887—1915), who completed it in 1914. He showed that the characteristic X rays decreased in wavelength and increased in frequency with the in-

creasing weight of the elements emitting them. This Moseley attributed to the increasing positive charge on the atomic nucleus as the atomic weight of the element increased.

This discovery led to a major improvement of Mendeleyev’s periodic table (see 1869). Mendeleyey had ar ranged the elements in order of increasing atomic weight but had to place some slightly out of order to keep them in their proper families. Moseley showed that if the elements were arranged in order of increasing nuclear charge, no element would have to be placed out of order.

The amount of positive charge on the nucleus was called the atomic number. It was 1 for hydrogen, the smallest atom, and 92 for uranium, the most complex atom then known. For the first time, chemists could now be sure how many new elements remained to be discovered, and where in the periodic table they would fall.

At the time Moseley advanced his atomic number suggestion, only seven numbers between 1 and 92 remained unrepresented by elements. They were numbers 43,61, 72, 75, 85, 87, and 91.

Moseley would undoubtedly have earned a Nobel Prize for physics for this work, but he died in action a year later in World War L.

1914,X-Ray Wavelength,"['Laue', 'William Henry Bragg', 'William Lawrence Bragg', 'Crystals Thirty', 'Arrhenius', 'Sodium', 'James Chadwick']","['British', 'English']","Laue’s discovery of X-ray diffraction by crystals (see 1912) led almost at once to efforts to determine the wavelengths of X rays by this method.

This was accomplished by a father-and-son team of British physicists. William Henry Bragg (1862-1942) and William Lawrence Bragg (1890-1971). They worked out the mathematical details involved in the diffraction and showed how to calculate wavelengths from it.

As a result, the two Braggs were awarded the Nobel Prize for physies in 1915.

lons and Crystals

Thirty years earlier Arrhenius had advanced the notion that electrolytes in solution dissociated into ions (see 1884). The idea was that a substance such as sodium chloride existed in solid form as a molecule, symbolized as NaCl, but on solution split up into the positively charged sodium ion (Na*) and the negatively charged chloride ion (cl).

When the Braggs were

studying X-ray diffraction, however (see above), they found that that phenomenon could best be understood if it was supposed that in a solid crystal of sodium chloride there were no intact molecules, merely sodium ions and chloride ions positioned with geometric regularity.

Sodium chloride and many other compounds did not exist as molecules in the older sense, then, but as arrays of ions held together by electromagnetic interaction.

Beta-Particle Energies

If a particular atom broke down to emit an alpha or beta particle, it would seem that a definite energy source had been broached, and particles of definite energies ought to be given off.

As early as 1904, W. H. Bragg (see above), studying radium, had shown that alpha particles were emitted with several different sharply delineated ranges. Presumably there were several different processes going on within the radium nucleus, and each gave off alpha particles of a particular energy.

In 1914, however, the English physicist James Chadwick (1891-1974)

showed that this was not true of beta particles. They came off in a continuous range of energies, from a sharply defined maximum down to zero. This was a puzzle that was not to be explained for a number of years.

"
1914,Proton,"['Thomson', 'Rutherford', 'Rutherford Prout']",['Greek'],"Thomson felt that positive rays consisted of streams of high-velocity atomic nuclei (see 1912). Rutherford studied them and came to the conclusion, in 1914, that the positive rays involving hydrogen nuclei were the smallest of all and that no smaller positively charged particles existed. He therefore called the hydrogen nucleus a proton (from the Greek word for “first”).

The proton is not the positive analog of the electron, however, even though the size of their electric charge is precisely the same. The proton is a much more massive particle (now known in fact to be 1836.11 times as massive as the electron).

After Rutherford had made his suggestion, it seemed that the massive nucleus at the center of the atom must be made up of protons. (This meant that Prout’s hypothesis that all elements were made up of

hydrogen—see 1815—was in a manner of speaking correct.)

Of course it didn't make too much sense that the atomic nucleus should consist of protons. After all, the protons, being positively charged, would repel each other. The natural suggestion, then, was that electrons were also present in the nucleus and that their negative charges acted as a kind of cement. This seemed all the more logical since radioactive changes caused atoms to eject electrons in the form of beta particles, and these seemed to come from the nucleus.

Furthermore, only in hydrogen were the mass and charge of the nucleus equal. Thus an alpha particle (a helium nucleus) had four times the mass of a proton but a positive charge only twice that of a proton. It seemed logical to explain this by supposing that an alpha particle consisted of four protons plus two electrons. The electrons neutralized the charge of two of the protons without affecting the mass much. The remaining two positive charges on the nucleus were neutralized by the two planetary electrons circling outside the nucleus.

It seemed, then, that all atoms were made up of

equal numbers of protons and electrons, with some of the electrons inside the nucleus and some circling around it.

This picture of the atom seemed simple and satisfactory but proved quite wrong, although the matter wasn't straightened out for sixteen years.

"
1914,Main Sequence,"['Hertzsprung', 'Henry Norris Russell', 'Russell', 'Russell Hertzsprung']",['American'],"Hertzsprung had noted that some red stars were giants and some were dwarfs (see 1905), with nothing in between. Independently, the American astronomer Henry Norris Russell (1877—-1957) noted this in 1914.

Russell also went into greater detail. He plotted the temperatures of stars against their luminosity and obtained a diagonal line that showed that the stars grew steadily dimmer as they grew cooler. This line, which extended from the hot luminous stars to the cool dim ones, was called the Main Sequence, because about 95 percent of the stars, including the red dwarfs, fell upon it. The red giants did not fall on it, because although they were quite cool (that was why they were red), they were very luminous, because of their enormous size.

J  The first thought was that the Main Sequence represented the line of evolution of stars; that they started as large, cool conglomerations of gas (red giants) that condensed and grew hotter till they reached the top of the Main Sequence as the hottest stars there were. They then gradually cooled and grew dimmer, ending as red dwarfs, finally becoming too cool to glow altogether.

This view turned out to be incorrect, but Russell’s diagram, based on observation, was correct. It merely had to be interpreted in better fashion. Giving Hertzsprung credit for priority, it is usually called the Hertzsprung-Russell diagram, or the H-R diagram for short.

From the strength of the companion'’s attraction to Sirius, the companion had to be about the mass of the Sun. At the distance of Sirius, a star with the mass

of the Sun that was as dim as the companion was should be very cool indeed and therefore red in

color. Yet the companion didn't seem to be red, but white.

The American astronomer Walter Sydney Adams (1876—1956) managed to get its spectrum in 1914, despite the blaze of nearby Sirius. The companion turned out to be a hot star, as hot as Sirius and hotter than our Sun. To be our Sun's mass and to be hotter than the Sun, too, the companion should have been blazing out as a first-magnitude star, but it wasn’t. In fact it is too dim to see without a telescope. The only way of explaining that was to suppose that Sirius's companion was a very small star, more nearly the size of the Earth than of the Sun—even though it had the mass of the Sun.

Had the discovery been made a few years earlier, it would have been dismissed as preposterous. However, now that science had accepted Rutherford's nuclear atom (see 1911), it seemed possible that under some conditions atoms might break down and the nuclei approach each other more closely than in ordinary matter. In the case of broken-atom degenerate

matter, densities might easily be a million times that of ordinary matter.

Sirius’s companion (now more commonly known as Sirius B, while Sirius itself is sometimes called Sirius A), being both tiny and white-hot, was called a white dwarf. It was the first of this class to be discovered, but white dwarfs were eventually found to be quite common, though only those relatively close to us can be seen because of their low total luminosity.

Jupiter IX

The tale of Jupiter's satellites did not end with the discovery of Jupiter VI and Jupiter VII (see 1904).

In 1908 the French astronomer Philibert Jacques Melotte discovered Jupiter VIII, which was still farther from Jupiter than VI and VII were. Jupiter VIII circled Jupiter at an average distance of 14,600,000 miles.

Then in 1914 the American astronomer Seth Barnes Nicholson (1891— 1963) discovered Jupiter IX. Its average distance from Jupiter is 14,700,000 miles and it circles Jupiter in two years and one month. No other known satellite anywhere in the Solar

1914,Earth’s Mantle and Core,"['Beno Gutenberg', 'Earthquake', 'Gutenberg']",['American'],"The waves set up by earthquakes apparently did not reach all parts of the Earth's surface even when they were strong enough to be detected everywhere.

There was a shadow zone within which no waves were detectable.

The German-born American geologist Beno Gutenberg (1889-1960), studying this phenomenon, suggested in 1914 that there was a core at the center of the Earth, about 2100 miles in radius, that was markedly different in density and chemical composition from the material outside that radius. Earthquake waves entering the core would be refracted in such a way as to be sent beyond the shadow zone. Based on the fact that transverse waves did not enter the core at all, Gutenberg suggested that the core was liquid.

Thus the Earth is divided into two parts, an

inner core, which (from its high density, and the fact that iron meteorites are common) seems likely to consist of liquid nickel-iron ina 1-to-9 ratio, and an outer mantle made up of rocky material. These two are in about the proportion of yolk to white in an egg, and the outermost crust is about the proportion of the eggshell.

The sharp dividing line between the mantle and the core is called the Gutenberg discontinuity.

the American psychologist John Broadus Watson (1878-1958) developed the thesis that human behavior was explainable in terms of conditioned responses, such as those Pavlov had demon-

strated (see 1907). Watson relegated even heredity to a minor role.

Animals, including the human being, he viewed as intensely complicated machines, which reacted ac-

In 1915 he conducted a dramatic experiment on prisoners in a Mississippi jail. Volunteers (who were promised pardons in return) were placed on a limited diet lacking meat or milk. After six months, they developed pellagra, which was relieved by adding milk and meat to their diet.

During this time Goldberger's study group went to great lengths to try to contract pellagra by contact with the patients, their clothing, and their excretions. They failed. Pellagra was definitely not contagious. Goldberger spoke of a P-P (pellagra-preventive)

Once Starling had advanced the hormone concept (see 1902 and 1905), it was clear that the thyroid must do its work by way of a hormone. It was known that the thyroid contained a characteristic protein called thyroglobulin, which was unique in possessing iodine, an element not till then known to be essential to life,

The American biochemist Edward Calvin Kendall (1886—1972) studied thyroglobulin looking for some simple component that would do the work of the thyroid gland in trace quantities and that would therefore qualify as the hormone

involved. In 1915 he isolated what he called thyroxine. In the course of subsequent years, it turned out to be an iodinecontaining amino acid related to the tyrosine found in proteins. It was the hormorie.

In 1916 he extended this to systems moving relative to each other at any velocity, however changing. This was his general theory of relativity, often shortened to general relativity.

To make this possible, he assumed that inertial mass (mass derived from measurements of acceleration) and gravitational mass (mass derived from measurements of gravitational intensity) were identical. He also assumed that space was curved in the presence of mass, and that gravitation was not a force but merely the result of moving objects following

the shortest possible path in curved space.

He advanced a set of equations to cover all this, equations that allowed grand conclusions to be drawn about the universe as a whole, so that he founded the science of cosmology. Einstein pointed out that Newton’s laws of gravitation produced results quite close to those of general relativity but that there were three kinds of differences that might be measured in order to decide which was a closer approach to reality.

First, Einstein’s theory allowed for a shift in the position of the perihelion of a planetary orbit slightly beyond that which would be expected in a Newtonian Universe. This advance of the perihelion had been discovered by Leverrier in the case of Mercury (see 1846, Vulcan) seventy years earlier. General relativity explained it without having to call upon an intra-Mer-

curian planet, which had never been found. The fact that this effect was already known rather diminished its importance, however.

Second, Einstein showed that light moving upward against a strong gravitational field should show a red shift. This involved something that had not been expected earlier, but even the Sun'’s gravitational field wasn’t intense enough to make the measurement practical. Nothing much could be done with the prediction, therefore.

Third, and most dramatic, Einstein showed that light would be deflected by a gravitational field substantially more than would be expected in a Newtonian Universe, and the difference could be measured. To do so, however, it would be necessary to locate stars in the neighborhood of the Sun during a total eclipse. Their light would have reached Earth  after passing close to the Sun and bending in its path very slightly as it did so, so that each star would be seen a bit farther from the Sun than it really was. This would appear if the same region of the sky was photographed when the Sun was in another part of the sky. However, World War I was raging and there was no way any eclipse expedition could be safely organized. In fact, it was difficult to get word of Einstein’s views out of Germany. So the world had to wait.

1916,Black Holes,"['Einstein', 'Karl Schwarzschild', 'Schwarzschild']","['German', 'Laplace']","After Einstein's equations for general relativity were published, the first to work out solutions for them was a German astronomer, Karl Schwarzschild (1873— 1916). He also calculated the gravitational phenomena in the neighborhood of a star with all its mass concentrated to a point.

In order for an object to move infinitely far from a body as the result of a single initial impulse, that initial impulse must produce a speed that will carry the object away so rapidly that its speed will not decline as quickly as does the gravitational pull (which declines with the square of the increasing distance). In that case, the gravitational pull

will never be intense enough to bring the object to a complete halt. This escape velocity equals 7 miles per second for Earth but only 1.5 miles per second for the Moon.

In general, the escape velocity from an object’s surface increases with the mass of the attracting object and also with its density. Over a century earlier, Laplace (see 1783) had pointed out that if an object was sufficiently massive and dense, even light wouldn’t have sufficient velocity to escape.

Schwarzschild studied the case of a star with a mass compressed more and more strongly till the star’s volume sank to zero, so that the gravitational pull at its surface got higher and higher without limit. Schwarzschild calculated the distance from such a point-mass at which light would barely have the speed to escape. This is the Schwarzschild radius. Once anything approached closer to the star than the Schwarzschild radius, it could never escape again. Not even light could.

Since nothing could escape, not even light, such a star would behave like a bottomless hole in space, so to speak. It would be a black hole, a name given to it half a century later.

1916,Electrons and Chemical Bonds,"['Moseley', 'Richard Wilhelm Heinrich Abegg', 'Gilbert Newton Lewis', 'Lewis', 'Nevil Vincent Sidgwick']","['Barkla', 'German', 'American', 'Langmuir', 'English']","Once Moseley had advanced his notion of atomic numbers (see 1914), it was understood that the neutral atom contained as many electrons in its outskirts as the value of the atomic number. A hydrogen atom had one planetary electron, a uranium atom had ninety-two, and the other elements had numbers in between.

What's more, study of the characteristic X rays of elements, which had been initiated by Barkla (see 1906), gave rise to the notion that the electrons existed in successive shells, Clearly, it was the electrons in the outermost shell that were most exposed and were therefore most capable of being removed, or of being shifted from ene atom to another. The German chemist Richard Wilhelm Heinrich Abegg (1869-1910) had already suggested in 1904, even before the details of electron shells had been worked out, that chemical reactions were the result of electrons being transferred from one atom to another.

An American chemist, Gilbert Newton Lewis (1875-1946), went into the matter in greater detail. He

pointed out in 1916 that the electron arrangements seemed to be particularly stable when the outermost shell contained eight electrons (or two, in the special case of helium). An atom with eight electrons in an outer shell and then one outside that (as in sodium or potassium) would so readily lose that one superfluous electron that it would be a very active element. An atom with seven electrons in its outermost shell (as in chlorine or bromine) would so readily accept an additional one that it would be reactive also And of course, atoms that had eight electrons in their outermost shell (as in the noble gases) or two (as in the special case of helium) would have little or no tendency to lose or gain an electron and so would be chemically inert. Moreover, two chlorine atoms might each contribute an electron to a shared pool, so that each would have eight electrons in its

outermost layer (its own seven plus one of its neighbor’s which it was sharing). Naturally, in order to be able to share electrons, the two atoms would have to remain in close contact, so that chlorine exists as twoatom molecules, and it takes energy to pull those atoms apart.

This sort of reasoning also accounted for other bonds routinely found in organic molecules among carbon, oxygen, hydrogen, and nitrogen atoms. And Lewis showed from a consideration of electron arrangements why various elements had the valences (see 1852) they did and why valence varied regularly over the periodic table.

Langmuir (see 1913) worked out a similar system of chemical bonding independently, and the English chemist Nevil Vincent Sidgwick (1873-1952) soon pointed out that the Lewis-Langmuir notions applied to complicated inorganic molecules as well.

1917,Superheterodyne Receiver,['Edwin Howard Armstrong'],['American'],"Until now, radio operation had been a rather complicated thing that had to be left to radio engineers. In 1916, however, the American radio engineer Edwin Howard Armstrong (1890— 1954) worked out a system for lowering the frequency of electromagnetic waves and then amplifying them. He called this a superheterodyne receiver,

The addition of such devices to radios made them far easier to use. The turn of a dial was all that was needed to get good reception, or to transfer reception from one wavelength to another. It was only after such devices were widely adopted that radios could be operated by anyone, so that they entered the home and became a vehicle for mass entertainment and information.

Einstein, in formulating his general relativity equations, understood that

if he was to have a static Universe, something would have to be added to the equations. He therefore added an arbitrary constant designed to make the equations come out right, so to speak. He later said this was the greatest scientific mistake of his life.

A Dutch astronomer, Willem de Sitter (1872— 1934), however, was content to travel wherever Einstein’s equations took him He pointed out, in 1917, that if the equations were

solved as they stood, the im-

a picture of an expanding universe seemed grotesque, for at the time, nothing about the Universe seemed to give a hint of this expansion, but de Sitter’s suggestion took on a great deal of importance in the next de-

Soddy's isotope concept had been advanced (see 1913), most of the new substances were recognized as isotopes of elements that were already known.

In 1917, however, the German physical chemist Otto Hahn (1879-1968) and a co-worker, Austrian physicist Lise Meitner (1878— 1968), discovered a truly new element that disintegrated into actinium (see 1899). They therefore named the new element protactinium (meaning “before actinium”).

1917,Sonar,"['Pierre', 'Paul Langevin', 'Langevin', 'Langevin Langevin', 'Sonar']","['Curie', 'French', 'German']","Pierre Curie, in discovering piezoelectricity (see 1880), had shown how to produce ultrasonic sound vibrations, These were put to use by the French physicist Paul Langevin (1872—1946). Waves are more easily reflected the shorter their length. Ordinary sound waves are long enough to bend around ordinary obstacles and are not efficiently reflected. The much shorter sound waves of ul-

trasonic vibration can easily be reflected by relatively small objects. The direction from which the reflection is received indicates the direction of the object, and the time it takes between emission and reflection (knowing the speed of sound) gives the distance, or range, of the object.

Since light cannot penetrate large thicknesses of water and ultrasonic vibrations can, the latter can be used to detect underwater objects such as submarines when light is impotent. Since World War I was raging and German submarines were a deadly danger to the Allies, it is not surprising that Langevin worked with that purpose in mind.

Langevin's system of echolocation was called sonar, an acronym (combination of initial letters) of sound navigation and ranging. While Langevin had the technique worked out in 1917, it could not be put into effective use before the end of the war.

Sonar is now used not only for the detection of underwater objects such as submarines and schools of fish, but also to study the conformation of the ocean floor. Sonar utterly revolutionized oceanography.  1918

Since th astronomers had assumed the Sun to be near the center of the Galaxy since the Milky Way encircled us more or less evenly, in a great arc around the sky.

There was one im-

portant asymmetry, how-

ever. Globular clu

These globular clusters

liam Herschel (1792—1871)

Indeed, about one-third of the globular clusters were to be found in the single constellation of Sagittarius, in which the Milky Way rather brighter and richer in stars than it is anywhere

Once the Cepheid y stick ( ) had been worked out by Leavitt and Hertzsprung 1905), i

ame possible to find in the globular and deterr

inces and the dis

tances of the clusters themselves.

This task was undertaken by the American astronomer Harlow Shapley (1885—-1972), making use of the new 100-inch telescope (see 1917). By 1918 he was able to make a three-dimensional model of the globular clusters and could see that they themselves formed a loose sphere around a point in Sagittarius far distant from the Solar System.

Shapley assumed (correctly, as it turned out) that the globular clusters were distributed around the center of the Galaxy. His estimate of the distance to that center was a trifle overlarge, something that was later corrected. We now know that the center of the Galaxy is 30,000 light-years away and that the Galaxy is about 100,000 light-years across. Our Solar System, far from being at the center of the Galaxy, is about 20,000 light-years from one end and 80,000 from the other. Shapley had dethroned the Sun from its position at the center of the Universe, as Copernicus had dethroned the Earth (see 1543).

We cannot see the center of the Galaxy (let alone the far half of the structure), because dark clouds of dust and gas in the Milky

Way obscure the view. We are, indeed, at the center of what we can see—which is not surprising.

With Shapley, astronomers finally got a more or less correct picture of the size of the Galaxy and of our own position in its outskirts. 1t was far larger than anyone had thought—it contained at least 100 billion stars and perhaps twice that number. It is not surprising, then, that astronomers thought our Galaxy and its two attendant and much smaller satellite galaxies, the Magellanic Clouds, made up the Universe.

This seemed large enough, but as it happened, astronomers had not yet even begun to grasp the true size of the Universe.

1917,Spectral Classes,"['Pietro Angelo Secchi', 'Annie Jump Cannon', 'Sirius', 'Al', 'Rigel', 'Proxima Centauri M5']","['Italian', 'American', 'B', 'F', 'G', 'K', 'Arcturus']","Not all stellar spectra are alike. Some resemble the Sun's, but most stars have spectra that are altogether different. The first to point this out was an Italian astronomer, Pietro Angelo Secchi (1818—1878), who in 1867 had divided stellar spectra into four classes. The notion of spectral classes came of age, however, with the work of the American astronomer Annie Jump Cannon (1863— 1941) who in 1918 began the meticulous and time-

consuming task of studying and classifying the spectra of many thousands of stars.

In so doing, she worked up a classification that is still used today. She used a system of letters, planning that there would be a smooth transition from A to B to C and so on. However, as the stars were arranged in order of decreasing surface temperature, the letters fell out of order, and some had to be omitted.

The spectral classes of the main sequence, in order of decreasing temperature, turned out tobe O, B, A, F, G, K, and M.

Each spectral class can be divided into ten subdivisions from 0 to 9, so that our Sun is a G2 star, Sirius is Al, Rigel is BS, Arcturus is K2, Betelgeuse is M2, and Proxima Centauri M5. All this turned out to be useful in dealing with stellar evolution.

1917,Radioactive Tracers,"['Knoop', 'Georg Karl', 'Hevesy', 'Suppose', 'Hevesy Hevesy']",['Hungarianborn'],"Fourteen years before, Knoop had used benzene rings as a tracer in fat metabolism (see 1904). It occurred to the Hungarianborn chemist Georg Karl von Hevesy (1885-1966) that it might be possible to use radioactive atoms as tracers. The advantage  would be that their concentration could be accurately determined even when they were present in trace quantities, thanks to the radiations they emitted.

In 1918 Hevesy decided to make use of a radioactive isotope of lead, formed by uranium breakdown. This radiolead was identical in chemical properties to ordinary stable lead. Suppose, then, he were to add a small quantity of radiolead to lead and use the mixture to produce certain lead compounds.

These lead compounds are only slightly soluble in water, so that one could not measure the concentration of the dissolved stable lead with anything approaching acecuracy. If, however, a lead compound with radiolead added is stirred in water so that a tiny fraction of the molecules dissolve, that same tiny fraction of the molecules containing radio-lead also dissolves. The amount of radio-lead in solution can then be easily and accurately determined, and the percentage of radiolead compound dissolved will be the same as that of the ordinary lead compound.

In later years, Hevesy followed the manner in which plants absorbed and distributed water by spiking it with a tiny quantity

of radiolead compound that he could follow accurately.

As long as radioactive tracing was confined to lead, it could only play a minor role, of course. Nevertheless, Hevesy had pointed out the potential of the technique, and the time was to come when it was to be a superb and essential tool for biochemists and others.

For this, and for other work, Hevesy was awarded the Nobel Prize for chemistry in 1943.

1917,Organizer,"['Hans Spemann', 'Spemann', 'Spemann Spemann']","['German', 'Spemann']","The German zoologist Hans Spemann (1869-1941) was interested in the development of embryos. Thirty years later, it had been shown that if the fertilized ovum of a test animal was divided in two, and if one of the resulting cells was killed with a hot needle, then the remaining cell would evolve into a longitudinal half of an embryo. The act of dividing in two had established the plane of bilateral symmetry.

If, however, a fertilized ovum divided in two and the two resulting cells were separated and each allowed to develop, each would form a complete (though smaller than normal) embryo. (It is this which results in the birth of

identical twins among human beings, for instance.)

To Spemann, the difference between a cell that developed from a divided fertilized ovum and one that developed while attached to a dead partner indicated that the individual cells of an embryo affected each other.

In a series of experiments, Spemann showed that even after an embryo had begun to show definite signs of differentiation, it could still be divided in half, with each half producing a whole embryo. This showed that cells remained plastic until quite late in the game.

Spemann found that an embryo develops according to the nature of neighboring areas. An eyeball develops originally out of brain material and is joined by a lens that develops out of nearby skin. If the eyeball is placed near a distant section of the skin, one that would never in the course of nature develop a lens, it nevertheless begins to develop one.

There were apparently organizers in the embryo that brought about certain developments nearby. For his work, Spemann was awarded the Nobel Prize for medicine and physiology in 1935.  1919

1917,Mass Spectrometer,"['Thomson', 'Soon', 'Soddy', 'Could', 'Thomson Francis William Aston', 'Thomson Aston', 'Aston', 'Aston Aston']",['British'],"Thomson had shown that neon atoms seemed to exist in two different varieties (see 1912). Soon afterward,

Soddy had advanced the isotope concept (see 1913), but it had at first seemed to apply only to radioactive elements and their breakdown products. Could perfectly stable elements also exist in the form of dif-

ferent isotopes? Was that the significance of Thomson’s findings with respect to neon?

The British chemist Francis William Aston (1877—-1945) improved on Thomson's apparatus and  in 1919 developed a mass spectrometer, which could separate ions so delicately that all ions of a particular mass would focus in a fine line on a photographic film. Working with neon ions, Aston showed that there were two lines, one indicating a mass of 20 and the other a mass of 22. From the comparative darkness of the two lines, Aston calculated that the ions of mass 20 were 10 times as numerous as those of 22, If all the ions were lumped together, they would have an average mass of 20.2, and that was indeed the atomic weight of neon. (Later, a third group of neon ions of mass 21, occurring in only a tiny concentration, was discovered.)

Working with chlorine atoms, Aston found again two types of atoms, with masses of 35 and 37, in the ratio of 2 to 1. A weighted average came out to 35.5, which was the atomic weight of chlorine.

The use of the mass spectrograph eventually showed that most stable elements (but not all) consisted of two or more stable isotopes. The atomic nuclei of a particular element all had the same positive electric charge, but the isotopes differed in mass. Each had its own mass number.

For this work, Aston was awarded the Nobel Prize for chemistry in 1922.

1917,Nuclear Reaction,"['Rutherford', 'Rutherford Rutherford', 'Rutherford Lewis']",['Rutherford'],"Rutherford, in his work with alpha-particle bombardments of matter (see 1906), had made gases his target. For instance, when he bombarded hydrogen, he got bright scintillations on a zinc sulfide screen (which gave off a flash of light whenever struck by an energetic subatomic particle). The alpha particles themselves produced scintillations, but the new scintillations, which appeared when hydrogen was present, were particularly bright.

Rutherford decided (correctly) that the alpha particles occasionally struck a hydrogen nucleus (consisting of a single proton) and hurled it forward. It was these speeding protons, he felt, that produced the bright scintillations.

In 1919, when nitrogen was introduced into the cylinder, occasional bright scintillations like those of protons were produced. Rutherford knew that the nitrogen nucleus had a charge of +7, so that it had to contain at least seven

protons. He felt that the alpha particle must knock one of these protons out of the nitrogen nucleus every once in a while.

The number of alphaparticle scintillations produced under these circumstances gradually decreased. Rutherford reasoned that some of the particles must be absorbed by the nitrogen nuclei. If a nitrogen nucleus absorbed an alpha particle with its charge of +2 and lost a proton with its charge of +1, the net change would leave the nitrogen nucleus with a total charge of +8. This is the characteristic charge of an oxygen nucleus.

In short, what Rutherford had done was to combine a helium nucleus (an alpha particle) and a nitrogen nucleus to form a hydrogen nucleus (a proton) and an oxygen nucleus. He had converted one type of atom into another by subatomic bombardment.

Ordinary chemical reactions involve the transfer or sharing of electrons, as Lewis had pointed out (see 1916). Now Rutherford had produced reactions that involved the transfer of particles inside the nucleus. In other words, he had brought about the first humanly engineered nuclear reaction.

1917,Gravitational Deflection of,"['Light Einstein', 'Arthur Stanley Eddington', 'Einstein', 'Brazil']","['London', 'Guinea', 'West Africa', 'Einstein']","e Light Einstein had advanced the theory of general relativity, which among other things predicted that light rays would bend slightly and follow a gently curved path when in a gravitational field (see 1916). The one way of testing that would be to study the stars in the immediate neighborhood of the Sun during a total eclipse, but astronomers had to wait for the end of World War I to make an eclipse expedition feasible.

On May 29, 1919, a solar eclipse was scheduled to take place at just the time when more bright stars would be in the vicinity of the eclipsed Sun than would be there at any other time of the year.

The Royal Astronomical Society of London, under the leadership of Arthur Stanley Eddington (1882—1944), who was a great enthusiast of Einstein’s theories, made ready two expeditions, one to northern Brazil and one to Principe Island in the Gulf of Guinea off the coast of West Africa. The positions of the bright stars near the Sun were measured relative to each other at the time of the eclipse. If light

was bent in its passage near the Sun, those stars would all seem to shift away from the Sun and would appear to be slightly farther apart from each other than they would six months earlier or six months later when they rode high in the midnight sky.

The positions of the stars proved to be in line with what Einstein had predicted, and this was considered a grand verification of general relativity.

However, the measurements were borderline and a trifle uncertain, and none of the tests of general relativity were entirely conclusive for an additional forty years, so that a number of other types of cosmological theories were advanced to compete with that of Einstein. (On the other hand, special relativity was confirmed over and over, and there has been no reasonable doubt concerning it for three-fourths of a century.)

1920,Bee Communication,"['Pavlov', 'Karl', 'Frisch']",['German'],"Pavlov’s conditioned responses (see 1907) could be used to elicit answers from animals about what they sensed.

The Austrian-born German zoologist Karl von

Frisch (1886-1982), for instance, conditioned bees to go to certain locations to pick up nectar, making certain that the location was of a certain color. They would then fly to other places of the same color, since they had been conditioned to react to that color as they would toa food source.

Frisch then changed the color to see what would happen to the conditioning. Thus, if he conditioned the bees to black and then substituted red, they flew to it anyway, indicating that they could not see red—red was black to them. However, if they were conditioned to black and that was changed to ultraviolet (which would still look black to human eyes), the bees no longer flew to it. They could see ultraviolet.

By 1919 Frisch had also interpreted the manner in which the bee communicated its findings to its colleagues of the hive, Having obtained honey from a new source, the returning bee would “dance,” moving round and round or side to side. The number of the evolutions and their speed gave the necessary information about the location of the new source. Frisch also showed that bees could orient themselves in flight by the direc tion of light polarization in the sky.

For this work, Frisch was awarded a share of the Nobel Prize for physiology and medicine in 1973.

1920,Stellar Diameter,['Michelson'],['New York Times'],"Throughout history, stars had been studied only as points of light, and all information about them had to be obtained in ways that required only points

In 1920, however, Michelson, who had first used his interferometer to compare the speed of light in different directions (see 1881), used it for another purpose. He built a 20-foot interferometer and attached it to the new 100inch telescope (see 1917). With it, he could measure light emerging from either side of the star Betelgeuse. (Betelgeuse is a relatively near red giant, so that its diameter was likely to prove more measurable than that of smaller or more distant stars.)

The two rays from the sides of Betelgeuse made a very tiny angle, but from the interference fringes they produced, Michelson

could measure the angle, and from that angle, knowing the distance of Betelgeuse, he could calculate its diameter. He worked it out to be about 260 million miles, or 300 times the width of our Sun.

1920,Novas in Andromeda,"['Shapley', 'Curtis', 'Kant', 'Shapley Curtis']","['Galaxy', 'American', 'Curtis', 'Galaxy Andromeda', 'Shapley']","The Andromeda nebula was a matter of dispute among astronomers in the early decades of the twentieth century. There were some who thought it was a cloud of dust and gas that was part of our own Galaxy (and that the same was true of other nebulas that resembled it). Others pointed out that the spectrum of the Andromeda and other such nebulas was that of starlight and not at all like that of the Orion nebula, which

was clearly a cloud of dust and gas. The Andromeda nebula and others like it might therefore be vast assemblages of stars that were independent galaxies but so far away from us that there was little hope of seeing their stars individually.

The leading exponent of a nearby Andromeda nebula was Shapley, who had worked out the shape and size of the Galaxy and determined the position of the Solar System within it (see 1918). The leading exponent of a far-off Andromeda nebula was the American astronomer Heber Doust Curtis (1872—1942).

Curtis reasoned that, although the Andromeda nebula might be too far away for ordinary stars in it to be made out, unusually bright stars such as novas ought to be visible. He therefore observed the nebula carefully and did see numerous very faint

il  stars that appeared and disappeared as though they were exceedingly faint novas. There were far more novas in the patch of light represented by the Andromeda nebula than there were in any other similarly sized patch of the sky. To Curtis, this meant that the Andromeda nebula contained a vast number of extremely faint stars and that it was an independent Galaxy (as Kant had suggested —see 1755).

In 1920 Curtis and Shapley met in a great debate before the National Academy of Sciences and discussed the matter of Andromeda. Majority opinion among astronomers was on the side of Shapley, but Curtis made an unexpectedly strong showing and won a moral victory. However, the matter could not be decided by debate. It had to await the necessary observations.

The wooden trunk of a tree contains rings that mark annual growth, wide ones in good years, narrow ones in bad years. Since all trees in a region share the same good years and bad vears, all of them have similar tree-ring patterns. These patterns are characteristic and do not ever quite repeat themselves over time. Therefore, if a piece of old weod is placed overlapping the tree-ring pattern of a freshly produced tree stump, you can determine the year in which the old wood was cut by counting rings of the new wood back to where the overlap begins. You can then follow its pattern back farther than you could that of the fresh wood, still

older pieces of wood can be fitted on, and so on.

By 1920, when Douglass convinced himself that such dendrochronology (Greek for “time-telling by trees'’) was a practical way of determining age where wood was concerned, he had traced his tree-ring calendar back for about five thousand years. The technique was particularly useful in dating objects of Native American prehistory.

Slow oscillations in the eccentricity of Earth's orbit and in the tilting of the Earth’s axis, together with the precession of that axis, seemed to suggest a 40,000-year cycle, which could be divided into a Great Spring, Great Summer, Great Au tumn, and Grear Winter, each about 10,000 years long.

Such anemics are pale and easily tired.

The American pathologist George Hoyt Whipple (1878-1976) induced an artificial anemia in dogs by bleeding them, then followed the manner in which new red blood corpuscles were formed. He kept the dogs on various kinds of diets to see what effect would be produced on corpuscle formation and found that, of the various foodstuffs he tried, liver was the most potent in correcting such anemia. This eventually led the way to the cure for a kind of anemia much more dangerous than simple iron-deficiency anemia.

For this reason, Whipple was awarded a share of the Nobel Prize for medicine and physiology in 1934.

1920,Air Masses,"['Vilhelm Friman Koren Bjerknes', 'Jacob Aall Bonnevie Bjerknes']","['Norway', 'Europe']","A father-and-son team of meteorologists, Vilhelm Friman Koren Bjerknes (1862— 1951) and Jacob Aall Bonnevie Bjerknes (1897— 1975), had set up weatherobserving stations all over Norway during World War 1.

By 1920 they had shown that the atmosphere is made up of large air masses and that there is a sharp differentiation in temperature between warm tropical air masses and cold polar air masses. The sharp boundaries between them they called fronts, from an analogy to the battle lines that had so preoccupied Europe in recent years.

This simplified the technique of weather prediction.  1921

1920,Insulin,"['Frederick Grant Banting', 'Charles Herbert Best', 'Best', 'Banting']","['Latin', 'Canadian']","By this time it seemed clear that the serious disease of diabetes mellitus had something to do with the pancreas; removal of the pancreas from experimental animals invariably produced a diabeteslike condition.

Once the hormone concept had been propounded by Starling (see 1902 and 1905), it was easily assumed that some hormone produced by the pancreas exerted control over carbohydrate metabolism. In the absence of the hormone, carbohydrate metabolism went out of control, with the result that glucose built up in the blood and spilled out in the urine. A variety of unpleasant symptoms made themselves manifest —with death as the end.

To be sure, it was well established that the chief function of the pancreas was to produce protein-digesting enzymes, but there were portions of the pancreas that seemed different from the rest. These portions, scattered through the pancreatic background, were the Islets of Langerhans (see 1869). Some sus-

pected that the islets produced the necessary hormone, and there were suggestions that the hormone be called insulin, from the Latin word for “island.”

No one had managed to isolate the hormone from pancreatic tissue, however. This was not surprising, since if insulin were protein in nature (as indeed it turned out to be), the digestive enzymes in the pancreas would digest and destroy it before it could be isolated.

The Canadian physician Frederick Grant Banting (1891—1941) had read that if the pancreatic duct was tied off in a living animal, the pancreatic tissue degenerated. The Islets of Langerhans, however, whose hormone product would not then be discharged through the duct but secreted directly into the bloodstream, were not affected. Then why not attempt to isolate insulin from a degenerated pancreas, in which no digestive enzymes would exist to spoil the extraction?

In 1921 Banting managed to obtain space at the University of Toronto and to get the services of an as-

sistant, the American-born Canadian physiologist Charles Herbert Best (1899-1978). Together Banting and Best tied off the pancreatic ducts in a number of dogs and waited seven weeks for the pancreas to degenerate. They then extracted a solution that quickly stopped the symptoms of diabetes. They had insulin.

As a result, Banting was awarded a share of the Nobel Prize for medicine and physiology in 1923.

1920,Vagusstoffe,"['Otto Loewi', 'Loewi', 'Loewi Dale', 'Loewi Vagusstoffe']","['American', 'Vagusstoffe', 'German']","It was well known by this time that the nerve impulse was electrical in nature. The German-born American pharmacologist Otto Loewi (1873-1961) felt that chemicals were involved, too, especially where the nerve impulse had to jump the tiny gap (or synapse) from one nerve cell to another.

In 1921, working with the nerves attached to a frog’s heart, particularly the vagus nerve, he showed that chemical substances were indeed set free when the nerve was stimulated,

The idea for testing to

see whether the chemical so obtained could be extracted and made to stimulate another heart directly, without the intervention of nerve activity, came to Loewi at 3 A.M. one night. He jotted down notes and went back to sleep but in the morning had forgotten the details and couldn't read his own writing. When the following night the same idea occurred to him, he took no chances. He went to the laboratory and got to work, By 5 A.M. he had proved his point.

Loewi called the substance Vagusstoffe (German for “vagus material”’). Dale, who had discovered acetylcholine a few years before (see 1914), recognized that its effects were similar to those described by Loewi and suggested that Vagusstoffe was acetylcholine. So it was, and Loewi shared the Nobel Prize for medicine and physiology with Dale in 1936.

1920,Rickets,"['McCollum', 'Vitamin C', 'Edward Mellanby']",['British'],"By now McCollum had distinguished between fat-soluble vitamin A and watersoluble vitamin B (see 1913). Vitamin C, the antiscurvy factor, was also water-soluble but had no effect on beriberi and was therefore a substance different from vitamin B.

The disease of rickets, thought to be a vitamin-deficiency disease at this time, was not affected by any of these three vitamins. The British biochemist Edward Mellanby (1884— 1955) undertook to track down some additional vitamin that might be involved.

By 1921 he had located a rickets-inhibiting substance in such animal fats as cod-liver oil, butter, and suet. The vitamin was fatsoluble, but its distribution was not that of vitamin A, and its absence did not produce the symptoms that absence of vitamin A did. Clearly, then, there were two fat-soluble vitamins, and the rickets-inhibiting one was labeled vitamin D.

Also in 1921, other researchers discovered that sunshine had a rickets-inhibiting effect. Sunshine itself couldn’t contain a vitamin, but it might convert some substance in skin into a vitamin. This, in fact, turned out to be the case.

1920,Glutathione,[],"['Hopkins', 'Tryptophan']","In 1921 Hopkins (see 1900, Tryptophan) isolated glutathione from tissues. It is a combination of three amino acids (a tripeptide) and switches easily between a reduced and oxidized state. That is, it can easily be

made either to give up a pair of hydrogen atoms or to take them up again. Hopkins demonstrated this ability on the part of glutathione and argued for its importance in tissue chemistry. First, such compounds can act as protectors for delicate compounds. By giving up their hydrogen atoms readily, they make it unnecessary for other compounds to give up theirs when that loss might do some damage harder to repair. Also, by bouncing back and forth between the two states, glutathione (and other such compounds) can bring about the easy transfer of atomic groupings from one substance to another.

1920,Magnetrons,['Albert Wallace Hull'],['American'],"By this time, many different varieties of radio tubes were being developed. In 1921 the American physicist Albert Wallace Hull (1880-1966) developed a diode (see 1904) that could produce bursts of short radio waves (microwaves) of high intensity. He called it a magnetron, because an external magnet was used to apply a magnetic field to the electrodes inside the tube. In the next decade, tubes of this sort played a key role in the development of radar.

1920,Tetraethyl Lead,['Thomas Midgley'],['American'],"One of the difficulties in automotive engineering was that of getting the gasoline vapors to burn smoothly within the cylinder. If they burned too rapidly, there was too great an explosion and a resulting “knock” in the engine. This was hard on the engine, disturbing to the ear, and wasted energy.

In 1921, however, the American chemist Thomas Midgley, Jr. (1889-1944) discovered that if the compond tetraethyl lead was added to the gasoline, it inhibited the burning just enough to prevent knock. It was an antiknock compound. From that time on, one could speak of “ethyl gas” or of “leaded gasoline.”

A bromine compound was also added to the gasoline, to prevent accumulation of lead in the cylinder. It meant that the relatively volatile compound lead bro-

mide was formed and discharged through the exhaust. This added another factor to the air pollution produced by automobiles.

Those colleagues went on to found psychoanalytic schools of their own and to add refinements to psychoanalytic theory. Thus the Austrian psychiatrist Alfred Adler (1870-1937) had popularized the notion of the inferiority complex in 1911. In 1921 the Swiss psychiatrist Carl Gustav Jung (1875-1961) popularized the concepts of introvert, for a person whose thoughts and interests are directed inward, and extrovert, for a

person whose thoughts and interests are concentrated on other people and the outside world.

In 1921, however, a Swiss psychiatrist, Hermann Rorschach (1884-1922), invented a nonconversational device for diagnosing psychopathological conditions

This involved the use of ten symmetrical inkblots, which patients were asked to interpret—to give their notion of what the abstract images represented. This Rorschach test became well known to the general public, although as with psychoanalytic techniques generally, it is difficult to tell objectively how useful itis.

In 1922 the English archaeologist Leonard Woolley (1880—1960) began his investigations along the course of the lower Euphrates River, particularly at what seemed to be the site of Ur, a very early city mentioned in chapter 11 of Genesis. His excavations introduced moderns to the ancient civilization of Sumeria in what is now southeastern Iraq. Sumeria was probably the first civilization on Earth; it is the Sumerians who invented writing.

Woolley's most startling finding was geological evidence of a great flood that must have spread devastation through Sumeria

about 2800 B.c. It was this flood that gave rise to the flood story in the epic of Gilgamesh (see 2500 B.c.) and to the biblical account of Noah's flood.

Woolley's findings were a great stimulus to the further study of early civilizations.

1922,Tutankhamen'’s Tomb,"['Egypt', 'George Edward Stanhope Molyneux Herbert', 'Earl', 'Howard Carter', 'Lord Carnarvon', 'Tutankhamen', 'Carter', 'Vitamin E', 'Herbert McLean Evans']","['Egyptian', 'Tutankhamen', 'Tutankhamen British', 'Carnarvon', 'Tutankhamen Egyptian', 'Egyptian American']","The ancient Egyptian pharaohs had magnificent burials, and much in the way of gold and other precious materials was interred with them. Every effort was made to keep the tombs from being rifled and the contents stolen, even to the extent of placing the tomb at the center of a solid pyramid.

All efforts failed. All tombs were burglarized— and a good thing, too. If all the gold had remained buried, it would have ruined the economy of the ancient world. The tomb-robbers

did civilization a remarkable favor by restoring the tomb contents to circulation.

By 1000 B.c., the great days of the pharachs were over, and every last tomb was empty—except one. From 1361 to 1352 B.c., the pharaoh ruling over Egypt had been Tutankhamen. He was only about 21 when he died, but he was given the usual sumptuous burial. His grave was at once robbed, but for a wonder, the robbers were caught in the act and forced to return the loot. Perhaps the fact that the grave had been looted had gotten out but the return had been kept quiet. At any rate, no further effort at looting was made for two centuries. Then, while a grave was being excavated for a later pharaoh, the resulting showers of stone chips covered the entrance to Tutankhamen'’s tomb, hiding it so effectively that it came down to the twentieth century intact.  A British archaeological expedition under George Edward Stanhope Molyneux Herbert, Earl of Carnarvon (1866—1923), and Howard Carter (1873— 1939) found the first sign of the entrance to Tutankhamen’s tomb on November 4, 1922. Three days later they reached the sealed burial chamber, and a rich treasure trove of ancient Egyptian artifacts was uncovered. It gave tremendous impetus to Egyptian studies.

It also gave rise to the silly tale of the “Pharaoh’s curse,” when Lord Carnarvon died five months later of an infected mosquito bite complicated by pneumonia, but surely no sane man could believe Tutankhamen had anything to do with it. Carter lived on for seventeen years after opening the tomb.

Vitamin E

Nutritionists were carefully placing rats, guinea pigs, and other animals on limited diets in order to find disorders that could be eliminated by the addition of particular foods to that diet. When diet could correct one disorder without having much effect on other disorders known to be caused by lack of a vitamin, the presence of a new vitamin could be suspected.

In 1922 the American anatomist Herbert McLean Evans (1882—-1971), who four years earlier had determined that human cells contained twenty-four pairs of chromosomes (actually twenty-three, it was later shown), found a limited diet that rendered rats sterile and that could be corrected by fresh lettuce, wheat germ, or dried alfalfa but not by already known vitamins. As a result, it looked as if another vitamin (later known as vitamin E) existed, one that was fat-soluble, as were vitamins A and D.

"
1922,Growth Hormone,[],[],"Evans, the discoverer of vitamin E (see above), also showed in 1922 that an extract of the pituitary gland (which is attached to the lower surface of the brain) served to promote gigaintism in rats, making them grow to a significantly larger size than normal. That indicated the presence of a growth hormone in the pituitary.

it to have bactericidal (bacteria-destroying) properties. [t was the first example of a human enzyme that had such properties, and it represented the as-yet pale dawn of a time when more powerful natural products of this sort would be found.

Origin of Life Darwin, who had advanced his theory of evolution six decades earlier (see 1858), had not taken up the matter of the origin of life. Not enough was known, and the subject was too touchy.

Spontaneous generation (life derived from nonlife) had been disproven by Pasteur (see 1860), but only under present conditions. In earlier times, when life first made its appearance, the Earth’s environment was radically different from what it is today (there was no oxygen in the atmosphere, for instance), and no life existed that might promptly consume the material that represented the first tentative approaches to life.

Even so, there was some reluctance to consider the matter of a naturalistic origin to life, one that did not require the intervention of a Creator. The first person to make a significant study of the matter was a Russian biochemist, Alex-

ander Ivanovich Oparin (1894-1980), who, living under a government that was officially atheist, had no inhibitions in doing so. He began his investigation of the subject in 1922, suggesting that life developed through the slow buildup of organic substances from the simple compounds present in the primordial ocean and atmosphere.

Sitter’s work, however, applied to a Universe empty of matter.

In 1922 the Russian mathematician Alexander Alexandrovich Friedmann (1888—1925) went further. Solving the equations for a Universe containing mass, he showed that it too would naturally expand.  1923

Waves as Particles

Einstein had pointed out that electromagnetic radiation could be viewed as having particle aspects, but it was still necessary to observe phenomena that could best be explained in that way. The shorter the wavelength of electromagnetic radiation, the greater the energy content of the quantum and the more pronounced the particle aspect is likely to be. It would seem a good idea, then, to work with X rays in this respect.

In 1923 the American physicist Arthur Holly Compton (1892-1962) showed that X rays scattered by matter tended to lengthen their waves. This was called the Compton effect.

Compton was able to account for this by presuming that when a quantum of X rays struck an electron, the electron recoiled, subtracting some energy from the quantum and therefore increasing its wavelength. This was a clear demonstration of the particle aspects of an energetic wave, and indeed, it was Compton

who now began to refer to such waves in their particle aspects as photons.

For this work Compton was awarded a share of the Nobel Prize for physics in 1927.

Particles as Waves

Even as Compton was demonstrating that waves showed particle properties (see above), the French physicist Louis-VictorPierre-Raymond de Broglie (1892—-1987) was maintaining that, from theoretical considerations, every particle ought also to have an associated matter-wave and therefore show wave properties.

The wavelength of such matter-waves would be inversely related to the momentum of the particle (that is, its mass times its velocity). A massive particle such as a baseball, or even a proton, would have matter-waves of such ultrashort wavelengths that they would be difficult or impossible to detect. Electrons, however, should have matter-waves with wavelengths similar to those of X rays.

Increasingly, after the

work of Compton and de Broglie, physicists began to take the view that all objects had both wave and particle aspects. Where energy was low (and mass is a form of energy), the wave aspect would predominate, and where energy was high, the particle aspect would predominate.

To be sure, de Broglie's work was strictly theoretical. An actual demonstration of matter-waves would not come for several years, after which de Broglie would be awarded a share of the Nobel Prize for physics in 1929.

Debye-Huckel Equations

When Arrhenius had worked out the theory of electrolytic dissociation (see 1884), it seemed clear that some compounds dissociated only partially on solution. As crystal structure was elucidated by Xray scattering (see 1912), however, it appeared that many compounds existed in totally dissociated form even in crystals. Why, then, should they seem to be only partially dissociated in solution?

Debye, who had developed the notion of dipole moments (see 1912), tackled the problem. He suggested that dissolved electrolytes were indeed completely dissociated in solution but that each positive ion was attended by a cloud of negative ions, while each negative ion was attended by a cloud of positive ions, The two types of ions therefore tended to insulate each other to some extent, and this gave the appearance of incomplete dissociation. Debye, with an assistant, the German chemist Erich Huckel, worked out equations to represent the situation. The Debye-Huckel equations are the key to modern interpretation of the properties of solutions.

Acid-Base Pairs

After the notion of ionic dissociation was established by Arrhenius, an acid came to be defined as a substance that split up to yield hydrogen ions, while a base was one that split up to yield hydroxyl ions (OH;s-). These neutralized each other, because hydrogen ions and hydroxyl ions combined to form neutral water molecules.

The Danish chemist Johannes Nicolaus Bronsted (1879-1947) suggested a

more general definition in 1923. An acid didn’t simply give up a hydrogen ion (which could be viewed as a proton), because as a proton, it could not exist loose in solution. The proton, once it broke free of the acid molecule, must promptly attach itself to another molecule. Therefore, chemists ought to speak of acid-base pairs. Whenever a proton transferred from one molecule to another, the one that gave up the proton was an acid, the one that accepted it was a base. This broadened the concept and made it more useful.

1922,Coenzyme Structure,"['Harden', 'Hans Karl', 'Harden Harden']",['German'],"Harden had shown that the yeast enzyme that fermented sugar had a nonprotein portion, which he called a coenzyme (see 1904). The chemical structure of that coenzyme was unknown, however.

It was not until 1923 that a German chemist, Hans Karl August Simon von Euler-Chelpin (1873— 1964), solved that problem and worked out the structure of Harden's coenzyme. The structure was related to that of the nucleotides that formed the building blocks of nucleic acid mole-

cules, and it received the name of diphosphopyridine nucleotide.

The most interesting thing about the molecule was that a portion of it, when broken off, proved to be the well-known chemical compound nicotinamide, which could easily be changed to nicotinic acid. Both possessed a sixatom ring made up of five carbon atoms and a nitrogen atom. This type of ring did not occur in living tissue except in this coenzyme and in other closely related compounds.

For this work, EulerChelpin was awarded a share (with Harden) of the Nobel Prize for chemistry in 1929.

The still-new 100-inch telescope offered a way of settling the matter. The American astronomer Edwin Powell Hubble (1889-1953) used it in 1923 to study the Andromeda nebula and managed to make out some ordinary stars (not novas) in it. Some of these stars were  Cepheids, which meant that Hubble could determine the distance of the nebula using the technique worked out by Leavitt (see 1912).

Hubble’s calculations showed that the Andromeda nebula was 750,000 light-years away, although eventually this turned out to be a substantial underestimate. Even so, the distance was great enough to indicate that the Andromeda nebula was rnot part of our galaxy but existed far beyond it and must be an independent galaxy. From that time on, it was termed the Andromeda Galaxy, and it came to be understood that the Universe consisted of numerous galaxies, as many as a hundred billion perhaps.

For the first time, the general structure of the Universe came to be understood, and it was realized that its size was far, far greater than had been thought.

1924,Ultracentrifuge,['Svedberg'],"['Swedish', 'Svedberg']","Materials that ordinarily remain in suspension in water, due to the incessant battering of surrounding molecules, can be made to settle out by means of a centrifugal effect. Instruments called centrifuges whirl suspensions and force the suspended material to the side of the vessel away [rom the center of rotation. In this way, red blood corpuscles can be separated from

blood, and cream from milk. (Since cream is less dense than the watery portion of milk, it collects on the inner side of the vessel, closer to the center of rotation.)

Ordinary centrifuges do not produce effects large enough to force colloidal particles smaller than red blood corpuscles or droplets of cream to settle out. But the Swedish chemist The Svedberg (1884-1971) developed an ultracentrifuge in 1923, which spun so quickly it developed effects equivalent to a gravity hundreds of thousands of times normal.

At such high rates of spin, the centrifugal effect can force ordinary protein molecules to settle out, and since mixtures of different types of proteins settle at different rates (the greater the molecular weight, the faster the rate of settling), different proteins can to some extent be separated in this way.

The rate of settling allowed the molecular weights of proteins to be determined with reasonable accuracy, and for this work Svedberg was awarded the Nobel Prize for chemistry in 1926.

In 1924 a small skull that, except for its size, looked human was discovered in a limestone quarry in South Africa. An Australian-born South African anthropologist, Raymond

Arthur Dart (1893-1988), examined it and recognized it as a primitive hominid. He called it Australopithecus, which is Greek for “southern ape.”

It was not an ape, however, for subsequent discoveries of several species of such australopithecines showed that they walked upright and were closer to modern humans than to any apes, modern or past. They are the earliest hominids, as far as we can now tell.

The resulting Bose-Einstein statistics may be used with any of a group of subatomic particles called bosons in Bose's honor. The best-known example of a boson is the photon.

lonosphere

Heaviside and Kennelly had predicted the existence of regions in the upper atmosphere that contained charged ions and that reflected radio waves (see 1902).

Details concerning this  layer were worked out by an English physicist, Edward Victor Appleton (1892—-1965). There was a problem at this time with the fading of radio signals, and Appleton found that this tended to take place at night. He felt it might be due to reflection from the

charged layers in the upper

atmosphere, which might be particularly prominent in the night sky.

If this were so, such reflection might set up interference, since the same radio beam would reach a given spot by two different routes, one direct and the

other by bouncing off the charged layers.

Appleton experimented by using a transmitter and receiver that were about 70 miles apart. He altered the wavelength of the signal and noted when the two beams, direct and reflected, were in phase, so that the signal was strengthened, and out of phase, so that it was weakened. From this he could caleulate the minimum height of refllection. In 1924 he found that the Kennelly-Heaviside layer was some 50 miles high

At dawn, the KennellyHeaviside layer broke up,

1925,Packing Fraction,"['Aston', 'Aston Einstein', 'Harkins', 'Exclusion', 'Sommerfeld', 'Wolfgang Pauli', 'Mendeleyev', 'Pauli']",['American'],"Six years earlier, Aston had used his mass spectrograph to determine the mass and relative occurrence of the isotopes of various stable elements (see 1919). Out of the 257 stable isotopes we now know to exist, he obtained the masses of 212. By 1925 Aston had brought his mass spectrograph to such a pitch of accuracy that he was able to show that the mass numbers of the individual isotopes were actually very slightly different from integers, sometimes a little above, sometimes a little

below. These slight discrepancies occurred because forming the nuclei from the individual subatomic particles that made them up absorbed or produced energy, and this energy was the equivalent of tiny bits of mass lost or gained in accordance with Einstein’s equation relating mass and energy (see 1905, Mass-Energy). The energy change produced by packing together subatomic particles in a nucleus was called the packing fraction. Since it represented the energy binding the particles together, it could also be called the binding energy.

This meant that if one type of nucleus was converted into another kind of nucleus with a tighter packing, mass would be lost and energy produced on a far larger scale per particle than was produced in ordinary chemical reactions involving the outer electrons of an atom.

This made sense out of Harkins’s contention that hydrogen-to-helium conversion would produce a great deal of energy (see 1915) and generalized it to nuclear reactions as a whole.

It also explained the energy of alpha particles. When an atom broke down  radioactively to another atom, comparative packing fractions reduced the total mass somewhat, and this made a certain amount of kinetic energy available for the emerging alpha particles. The alpha particles invariably came out with the energy to be expected of the mass loss.

Beta particles remained puzzling. The maximum energies they possessed were always those to be expected of the mass loss, but there were beta particles that invariably emerged at lesser energies—all the way to zero— and the explanation for that still eluded physicists.

Exclusion °

Principle Bohr and Sommerfeld had worked out the energy levels of the electrons in an atom (see 1913). These could be expressed as quantum numbers, which followed certain simple rules. Three quantum numbers were known at this time.

The Austrian-born American physicist Wolfgang Pauli (1900-1958) considered the matter and felt that there was need for a fourth quantum number, If that were allowed according to certain rules,

then it would be possible to show that no two electrons in a particular system of electrons could have all four quantum numbers alike. In other words, if a particular electron in an atom had one of the four quantum numbers, all the other electrons would be excluded from having that number. This was called the exclusion principle, and it allowed the arrangement of electrons in any atom to be worked out. It also explained why Mendeleyev's periodic table (see 1869) took the form it did.

For the exclusion principle, Pauli was awarded the Nobel Prize for physics in 1945.

1925,Particle Spin,"['Pauli', 'George Eugene Uhlenbeck', 'Samuel Abraham Goudsmit', 'Pauli Eventually']",['Dutch'],"Once Pauli had enunciated the exclusion principle (see above), two Dutch physicists, George Eugene Uhlenbeck (1900-1988) and Samuel Abraham Goudsmit (1902—1978), at once pointed out that the fourth quantum number that Pauli had decided was required could be interpreted neatly as particle spin. Each particle, such as an electron, could spin either clockwise or counterclockwise at a rate that could be expressed as +'2 or — ', Eventually, similar

spins (equal to 2 or some multiple thereof) were found to exist for almost all other particles.

"
1925,Matrix Mechanics,"['Werner Karl Heisenberg', 'Magnetism', 'Absolute Zero', 'Willem Hendrik Keesom', 'William Francis Giauque']","['Bohr', 'German', 'Dutch', 'Debye', 'American']","Beginning with Bohr (see 1913), physicists had tried to interpret spectral lines (which represented energy given off or taken up as electrons passed from one state to another) using images similar to those used for planets circling a star. They spoke of circular orbits, elliptical orbits, tilted orbits, rotation about an axis (particle spin), and so on.

The German physicist Werner Karl Heisenberg (1901-1976) considered all this useless and misleading. He preferred to take the numbers representing the energy level and manipulate them without regard to their pictured significance. In 1925 he developed a form of manipulation called matrix mechanics for the purpose.

Magnetism and Absolute Zero The Dutch physicist Willem Hendrik Keesom (1876~

1956) had managed to reach a temperature of 0.5

P

degrees above absolute zero (0.5° K), but hope of getting lower temperatures by methods such as gas expansion, which had worked till then, seemed over.

In 1925, however, Debye (see 1912) suggested something new. He pointed out that a paramagnetic substance (one that concentrates magnetic lines of force) can be placed almost in contact with liquid helium, separated from it by helium gas, and the temperature of the whole system reduced to about 1° K. If the system is then placed within a magnetic field, the molecules of the paramagnetic substance will line up parallel to the field's lines of force and, in doing so, give off heat. If this heat is removed by further slight evaporation of the surrounding helium, and the magnetic field is then removed, the paramagnetic molecules will immediately fall into a random orientation, absorbing heat as they do so. Since the only source of heat will be the liquid helium, its temperature will consequently drop below 0.5° K.

The same suggestion was made independently, soon afterward, by the American chemist William Francis Giauque (1895— 1982), but it was not until

another decade had passed that the idea was put into practice.

1925,Gravitational Red Shift,"['Einstein', 'Adams', 'Sirius', 'Sirius B', 'Adams Einstein']",[],"Einstein had predicted that light rising against a gravitational field would lose energy so that it would redden slightly (see 1916). The Sun’s gravitational field, though intense,

was not intense enough

to show a measurable effect.

Ten years before, however, W. S. Adams had shown that Sirius’s companion star, Sirius B, was tiny and extraordinarily dense. Its combination of large mass and small size meant it had a gravitational field more than ten thousand times as intense as the Sun's, It should show a gravitational red shift if, in fact, one existed.

In 1925 Adams managed to study the spectrum of the tiny star and detected a red shift close enough to that predicted by Einstein to be considered evidence of the validity of the theory of general relativity. As in the case of the bending starlight, however (see 1919), it was a borderline observation.

They named it rheniwm, after the Latin name of the Rhine river.

Although they didn’t know it at the time, Noddack and Tacke (they were married the next year) had discovered the eighty-first and last element that possessed stable isotopes. Four elements between 1 and 92 now remained to be discovered, atomic numbers 43, 61, 85, and 87. Of these, elements 85 and 87 could be assumed to be radioactive, but there seemed no reason to suppose that elements 43 and 61 were. In fact, Noddack and Tacke announced the discovery of element 43 at the same time as that of rhenium. They called element 43 masurium, after a district in eastern Germany. In the case of this element, however, their observations were mistaken.

An English chemist, Robert Robinson (1886— 1975), was particularly skillful at synthesizing complex molecules, and in 1925 he synthesized morphine. From the methods of the synthesis, he could deduce its exact structure, atom for atom.

A German biochemist, Otto Heinrich Warburg (1883—1970), was studying the cytochromes and noticed that carbon monoxide attached itself to them in the same way that they attached themselves to hemoglobin.

1926,Wave Mechanics,"['Broglie', 'Erwin Schrodinger', 'Bohr', 'Schrédinger', 'Bohr Bohr', 'Heisenberg', 'Schradinger', 'Schrodinger']","['Austrian', 'Schrodinger']","Three years earlier, de Broglie had suggested that particles such as electrons might have wave aspects (see 1923).

In 1926 an Austrian physicist, Erwin Schrodinger (1887—1961), decided that if the electron was viewed as a wave rather than as a particle, Bohr's electron orbits (see 1913 and 1915) might make more sense.

Schrédinger imagined an atom in which the electron could be in any orbit, provided that its matterwaves would extend around that orbit in an integral number of wavelengths. This would produce a standing wave and therefore would not represent an electric charge in oscillation. The electron, as long as it remained in such an orbit, need not radiate light and would not violate the conditions of Maxwell’s equations (see 1865).

Furthermore, the permissible orbits worked out by Bohr and others all involved whole wavelengths, and the lowest orbit was one that involved a single wavelength. In this way, Bohr's suggestions came to make solid sense.

This view of Schrodinger's was called wave mechanics, and it was soon shown to be mathematically equivalent to Heisenberg's matrix mechanics of the year before (see 1925). However, Schradinger’s waves seemed the more attractive idea of the two, because they did offer the mind a picture of the atom.

Schrodinger worked out the mathematical underpinnings of wave mechanics; a key relationship that he presented is known as the Schrodinger wave equation.

For his work on wave mechanics, Schrodinger was awarded a share (along with Dirac—see 1930) of the Nobel Prize for physics in 1933.

He gave electron waves a probabilistic interpretation: the rise and fall of waves could be taken to indicate the rise and fall in probability that the electron behaved as though it was a particle existing at those points in the wave packet.

He also worked on the mathematical basis of such a view. He, Schrodinger, and Heisenberg (see 1925) may be viewed as the inventors of quantum mechanics, which ever since has been used to interpret chemistry and subatomic physics with remarkable success. Quantum mechanics and Einstein's relativity (see 1905 and 1916) are the two great theoretical foundations of twentieth-century physics.

For his work on quantum mechanics, Born was

awarded a share of the Nobel Prize for physics in 1954.

Fermi-Dirac Statistics

Bose and Einstein had worked out the BoseEinstein statistics a year earlier, but the statistics now turned out to hold only for those particles (like the photon) that had spins of integral values: 0, 1, 2, and so on. Particles like the proton and electron had spins of half-values: 2, 1'%, and so on.

Once Pauli had worked out the exclusion principle (see 1925) for particles with half-value spins, it was clear that Bose-Einstein wouldn’t work for particles with such spins. A new set of statistics would therefore have to be worked out.

Taking the lead in working out that problem, in 1926, was an Italian physicist, Enrico Fermi (1901—1954). Dirac (see 1930) also contributed, so that the result is known as the Fermi-Dirac statistics. All particles subject to these statistics, like the proton and electron, are called fermions in honor of Fermi.

1926,Galactic Rotation,"['Kapteyn', 'Bertil Lindblad', 'Jan Hendrik Oort', 'Isaac Newton', 'Robert Hutchings Goddard', 'Goddard']","['Swedish', 'Dutch', 'Chinese', 'Middle Ages', 'American']","Twenty-two years before, Kapteyn had observed that there were two star streams moving in opposite directions (see 1904). In 1926 the Swedish astronomer Bertil Lindblad (1895-1965), analyzing these motions carefully, showed that they were just what would be expected if we viewed the Galaxy as rotating about its center.

Shortly thereafter, the Dutch astronomer Jan Hendrik Oort (b. 1900) came to the same conclusion.

Liquid-Fuel Rockets

The Chinese had made use of rockets in the Middle Ages, and Isaac Newton, with his law of action and reaction (see 1687), had shown that rockets were one way of traveling through outer space. Until the twentieth century, however, rockets had made use of gunpowder as the fuel and had depended on the atmosphere for oxygen.

A crucial change was introduced by the American physicist Robert Hutchings Goddard (1882-1945). He had been interested in

rocketry since his teens, and it occurred to him that a rocket would be more powerful and under better control if it made use of a liquid fuel such as gasoline and carried its own oxidizer in the form of liquid oxygen.

On March 16, 1926, Goddard fired his first liquid-fuel rocket. It was about 4 feet high, 6 inches in diameter, and was held in a frame like a child’s jungle gym. It rose 200 feet into the air. It didn’t seem like much, but that little rocket marked the first step in the expansion of the human range beyond the atmosphere.

1926,Enzyme Crystallization,"['Payen', 'Willstatter', 'James Batcheller Sumner', 'Sumner']",['American'],"Although Payen had isolated an enzyme for the first time nearly a century before (see 1833), scientists still didn’t understand the chemical nature of enzymes.

From the fact that enzyme action could be destroyed by gentle heating, it might be supposed that enzymes were proteins. However, Willstatter (see 1906) had purified enzyme solutions as far as he could while still retaining the enzyme action and had then

tested the solution for protein content and found none. From this he deduced that enzymes were not proteins, but actually the test was not conclusive. Enzymes might be so active that they need be present in only trace amounts to do their work—in amounts too small for Willstatter’s tests to be positive.

The solution might be to prepare more concentrated preparations of enzymes and then test them This was done by the American biochemist James Batcheller Sumner (1887— 1955). In 1926 he was extracting an enzyme from jackbeans, one that catalyzed the breakdown of the waste product urea to ammonia and carbon dioxide. The enzyme was therefore called urease.

In performing his extraction, Sumner found that a number of tiny crys-

tals precipitated out of one of his fractions. He isolated the crystals, dissolved them, and found that not only did they show strong urease activity, but he could not separate the activity from the erystals. He concluded that the crystals were the enzyme. If he was correct, it would be the first time anyone had prepared an enzyme in crystalline form and therefore in relatively pure condition. When he tested the crystals, he found them to be incontrovertibly protein. For this, he was awarded a share of the Nobel Prize for chemistry in 1946.

Recalling that Whipple had found liver to be helpful in treating ordinary anemia (see 1920) and believing that pernicious anemia might be a dietary deficiency disease caused by the lack of some essential vitamin, Minot wondered if this vitamin might be found in liver. He and his assistant, William Parry Murphy (b. 1892), put pernicious anemia patients on a liver diet and by 1926 had demonstrated success. It wasn't pleasant, eating quantities of liver for indefinite periods, but it delayed death.

As a result, Minot and Murphy (along with Whipple) were awarded the Nobel Prize for medicine and physiology in 1934,

"
1927,Uncertainty Principle,"['Planck', 'Heisenberg']","['Heisenberg', 'Planck']","It had always been assumed by scientists that given enough patience, enough delicacy, and the proper instruments, any and all properties of anything observable could be measured to any degree of accuracy. It seemed axiomatic.

In 1927, however, Heisenberg (see 1925) showed that a careful consideration of quantum mechanics proved this to be wrong. One could determine, for instance, the momentum of a subatomic particle to any degree of precision, and the position of a subatomic particle to any degree of precision, but one could not determine both at the same time to any degree of precision. The more closely you determined a particle’'s momentum, the less certain you could be of its position, and vice versa. (The same was true if you tried to determine both the energy content of a particle and the exact time at which you were trying to observe it.) The uncertainty in the

knowledge of momentum multiplied by the uncertainty in the knowledge of position was equal to Planck's constant (see 1900).

Planck’s constant represented, so to speak, the graininess of the Universe. It seemed that if you tried to inspect the Universe very closely indeed, you would come up against the grain and could detect nothing finer than that.

It was rather like trying to magnify a photograph made up of tiny patches of dark and light. Under ordinary conditions, the picture looks smooth and well defined. Magnify it sufficiently, though, and the tiny patches expand till the picture seems to be a chaos of meaningless light and dark. You have reached the limits of magnification and of further information.

Heisenberg had discovered the uncertainty principle. At first glance, it would seem to negate any hope scientists might have of discovering “truth” to the finest detail, but looked at in another way, the uncertainty prineiple is how the Universe works, and its existence as a limitation ex-

plains many facets of the Universe that would be meaningless if that limitation did not exist. For example, to explain why helium doesn't freeze at ordinary pressures, even at absolute zero, requires a line of reasoning in which the uncertainty principle plays an essential part.

It was for this principle that Heisenberg was awarded the Nobel Prize for physics in 1932.

1927,Electron Diffraction,"['De Broglie', 'Clinton Joseph Davisson', 'Davisson', 'Davisson Diffraction', 'George Paget Thomson', 'Thomson', 'Broglie', 'Davisson Thomson']","['American', 'British']","De Broglie had suggested that electrons and indeed all particles had wave aspects (see 1923). No one since, however, had actually caught a particle behaving like a wave.

An American physicist, Clinton Joseph Davisson (1881-1958), however, was studying the reflection of electrons from a metallic nickel target enclosed in a vacuum tube. The tube shattered by accident, and the heated nickel promptly developed a film of oxide that made it useless as a target. To remove the film, Davisson heated the nickel for

an extended period. Once this was done, he found that the reflecting properties of the nickel had changed.

Whereas the target had contained many tiny crystal surfaces before heating, it contained just a few large crystal surfaces afterward. Davisson therefore carried matters to a logical extreme and, in 1927, prepared a single nickel crystal for use as a target.

Once that was done, he found that an electron beam was not only refracted, but also diffracted just as a beam of X rays would be. Diffraction was a characteristic property of waves, so in this way the wave aspect of electrons was detected.

In 1927 the British physicist George Paget Thomson (1892-1975), the son of J. J. Thomson, who had discovered the electron (see 1897), sent a beam of fast electrons through thin gold foil and also demonstrated electron diffraction.

Thus de Broglie's theory was amply confirmed, and for doing so Davisson and Thomson were awarded shares in the Nobel Prize for physics in 1937.

In the California mountains, he surveyed a 22-mile distance between two mountain peaks to an accuracy of less than an inch. He made use of a special eight-sided revolving mirror to reflect a light beam in the fashion used by Foucault (see 1849).

In 1927 he obtained a value of 199,798 kilometers per second for the speed of light. This was only about 6 kilometers per second faster than the figure determined nowadays by much more sophisticated equipment.

1927,Cosmic Egg,"['Friedmann', 'Lemaitre', 'Universe']",['Belgian'],"Friedmann had developed the theoretical concept

of an expanding universe (see 1917), and in 1927 the Belgian astrophysicist Georges-Henri Lemaitre (1894-1966) drew what seemed a natural conclusion.

If the Universe was expanding as time went forward, then if we imagined the situation reversed and looked back in time, we should see the Universe contracting. (It would be as though we had taken a film of the expanding Universe and were running it backward.)

If we looked forward,

the Universe might well expand forever, but if we loock backward, the contraction had to be limited. Eventually, at a point far enough back in time, all the matter of the Universe would be compressed into one relatively small body, which Lemaitre called the cosmic egg.

This cosmic egg apparently exploded in what came to be called the big bang and started the expanding Universe that now exists. Of course, Lemaitre could offer no scientific explanation of where the cosmic egg came from and just how its explosion led to the present Universe. Physicists have been trying to work that out ever since.

In 1927 they took the simplest case, that of the hydrogen molecule. It consisted of two hydrogen atoms, each

contributing its single electron to a shared pair.

It turned out that quantum mechanics explained the properties and behavior of the hydrogen molecule neatly. This was the beginning. Eventually quantum mechanics was applied to every facet of chemistry, greatly advancing our understanding of the subject and making it, to some degree, a branch of physics.

In 1920 he took up a post at the Peking Union Medical College so that

he might investigate the region for hominid remains.

In 1927, in a cave at Cho-K'ou-tien, 25 miles west of Peking, he located a single human molar. From this tooth alone, he deduced the existence of a small-brained hominid, which he called Sinanthropus pekinensis (Greek for “Chinese human of Peking"") and popularly known as Peking man.

Later discoveries showed that Peking man was very similar to Java man, which Dubois had discovered (see 1890). Both are now considered examples

of Homo erectus, a species that preceded Homo sapiens (ourselves and Neanderthal man), and which in turn was preceded by the australopithecines, which Dart had discovered (see 1924).

Naturally the line of descent was not complete. Other discoveries remained to be made.

X Rays and Mutations

Morgan (see 1907) had been working with the fruit fly for two decades, and one of his students was the American biologist Hermann Joseph Muller (18901967).

To make the studies ontruit flies worthwhile, mutations had to occur, and so they did, but randomly and not often enough for Muller. He found, in 1919, that keeping the fruit flies at a higher temperature increased the mutation rate, and he decided that this might be so because at a higher temperature, the molecules in the genes vibrated more strongly and were therefore more likely to undergo spontaneous random change.

If this were so, and if mutations were the result of molecular change, was there something that would bring them about faster than raising the temperature would?

It occurred to him to try X rays. They were more energetic than gentle heat, and if they struck a gene they would certainly affect some atomic group. He made use of X rays, and by 1927 it was quite clear that they worked. The mutation rate went up sharply.

This was not only useful from the standpoint of genetics. It became plain that most X-ray-induced mutations (and indeed, mutations induced in any fashion) were deleterious. This meant that X rays and radioactive radiations had the capacity to harm human beings who worked with them carelessly.

Muller publicized this and subsequently fought for the safe handling of radiation.

M and N Blood Groups

Landsteiner had discovered the A, B, O series of blood groups and demonstrated their importance in blood transfusion (see 1900). He thought it was possible that other blood groups might exist that were not of importance to transfusion but that might still be of inter-

est in studying heredity, distinguishing between geographically separated human groups, determining paternity questions, and so on.

Thus in 1927 Landsteiner and his group discovered blood groups they designed as M, N, and MN.

He was through with it, actually, and was about to discard the dish containing the culture when he noticed that some specks of mold had fallen into it. Around every speck, the bacterial colony had dissolved away for a short distance. Bacteria had died and no new growth had invaded the area.

Fleming isolated the mold and eventually identified it as one called Penicillium notatum, closely related to ordinary bread mold. He decided that it liberated some compound that, at the very least, inhibited growth, and he called the substance penicillin.

Fleming tested the mold on various types of bacteria and found that some were affected and

some were not. Human cells were not affected. He did not go further, and it was to be over a decade before scientists returned to the problem. Nevertheless,

for this discovery, Fleming received a share of the Nobel Prize for medicine and physiology in 1945.

Diels-Alder Reaction

Chemists who specialize in organic synthesis are delighted when they can find a chemical reaction that will put together atoms in some fashion and that will work under a variety of conditions.

In 1928 two German chemists, Otto Paul Hermann Diels (1876—1954) and Kurt Alder (1902— 1958), found a reaction that would join two compounds in such a way as to form a ring of atoms. This was properly a diene synthesis but came to be called the Diels-Alder reaction.

By demonstrating that scattered light had weak components of changed wavelengths, he showed that photons of visible light had particle aspects. Furthermore, the exact wavelengths produced in the scattering depended upon the nature of the molecules doing the scattering. For this reason, Raman spectra proved to be useful in determining some of the fine details of molecular structure.

For his discovery, Raman was awarded the Nobel Prize for physics in 1930. He was the first Asian to win a Nobel Prize.

The principles so developed could then be applied to far more complicated games, such as business or war, and an attempt made to work out the best strategy to beat a competitor or an enemy. Even scientific research can be considered a game, one in which scientists pit their wits against the impersonal Universe.

Since its molecules seemed to have six carbon atoms and since it had the properties of a sugar, Szent-Gyorgyi named it

hexuronic acid. (The hex is from the Greek word for “six"""" and the uronic is a common suffix for sugarrelated compounds.)

After that he measured the radial velocity of other galaxies and found that all but two were receding from us.

The American astronomer Milton La Salle Humason (1891-1972) continued these labors, working with Hubble, who had first proved the Andromeda to be an independent galaxy. Humason measured the radial velocity of many more galaxies and also found that all were receding from us, some at unusually large rates.

Hubble went over all the work carefully and used various methods for estimating the distances of the various galaxies. By 1929 he felt sufficiently confident of his conclusions to announce them. Galaxies, he maintained, receded from us at a rate proportional to their distance from us (Hubble's law).

What is so important about our Galaxy that all the others (except for two of the very closest) should be receding from us, and why should those farther off be receding more quickly than those nearer? The explanation that seemed most logical was that the Universe was expanding in accordance with the suggestion of Friedmann (see 1917), so that the galaxies (or clusters of galaxies) were all receding from each other, and not merely from us. An observer in any galaxy would see the other galaxies receding at a rate proportional to their distance.

With Hubble, then, the expanding Universe ceased being a matter of theory and became an observed fact.

Russell, who had earlier helped work out the matter of the Main Sequence (see 1914), showed that the Sun consisted almost entirely of hydrogen and helium, in a 3-to-1 mass ratio. The most important of the minor components were oxygen, nitrogen, neon, and carbon. (This turned out to be similar to the composition of the Universe as a whole, as nearly as astronomers can determine.)

"
1928,Solar Energy,"['Helmholtz', 'Pierre Curie', 'George Gamow']",['American'],"Three-quarters of a century before, Helmholtz had suggested that the Sun obtained its energy from gravitationally induced shrinkage (see 1853). This had given an impossibly small age for the Earth, but no suitable substitute source of energy had been found until the existence of nuclear energy was demonstrated by Pierre Curie (see 1901). Then it seemed very likely that some sort of nuclear reaction was the solar power source.

In 1929 the Russianborn American physicist George Gamow (1904— 1968) suggested that the nuclear source was the conversion of hydrogen nuclei into helium nuclei, since these two elements made up nearly all the Sun, as Russell had shown (see above). As four hydrogen nuclei had to fuse together to form one helium nucleus, this process was called nuclear fusion, or more specifically, hydrogen fusion.

However, not enough was known about nuclear fusion as yet for Gamow to flesh out his suggestion in detail.

"
1928,Coincidence Counter,"['Walther Wilhelm Georg Franz Bothe', 'Bothe']",['German'],"In 1929 the German physicist Walther Wilhelm Georg Franz Bothe (1891— 1957) devised a new method of studying cosmic rays. He placed two Geiger counters (see 1908) one above the other and set up a circuit that would record an event only if both counters recorded it virtually simultaneously.

This would happen only if a cosmic ray particle, streaking down from above, shot vertically through both counters. Particles coming from some other direction would pass

through one counter and not the other. And particles that were not cosmic rays, though coming from the right direction, would be insufficiently energetic to pass through both.

Such a coincidence counter turned out to be very useful in measuring the shert intervals of time between passage through one counter and the next. These ultrashort intervals were still long enough for events to take place on the subatomic scale. Bothe used this technique to show that the laws of conservation of energy and of momentum were as valid for atoms as for billiard balls.

For his coincidence counters, Bothe was awarded the Nobel Prize for physics in 1954.

1928,Particle Accelerator,"['Rutherford', 'John Douglas Cockeroft', 'Ernest Thomas Sinton Walton', 'Cockeroft', 'Walton', 'Isotopes', 'Atomic Weights Aston']","['British', 'Irish', 'Giauque']","In the quarter-century since the discovery of radioactivity, the most energetic particles easily available to nuclear physicists had been alpha particles. The shorter the halFlife of a particular radioactive isotope, the more energetic the alpha particles they produced. Rutherford used alpha particles to bombard atoms and induce nuclear reactions (see 1906), but even

the most energetic alpha particles could only do so much. Of course, cosmic ray particles were more powerful still, much more powerful, but they were not under scientists’ control.

What was needed was some way of beginning with ordinary nuclear particles, say protons obtained by ionizing hydrogen atoms, and then accelerating them, perhaps by means of an electromagnetic field.

This was first accomplished by the British physicist John Douglas Cockeroft (1897-1967) and his coworker, the Irish physicist Ernest Thomas Sinton Walton (b. 1903). In 1929 they devised a voltage multiplier that would build up high electrical voltages capable of accelerating protons to the point where they contained more energy than the alpha particles occurring in nature.

This was the first particle accelerator (better known to the public for a time as an atoni-smasher). For this work, Cockeroft and Walton were awarded the Nobel Prize for physics in 1951.  Oxygen Isotopes and Atomic Weights

Aston’s work with the isotopes of stable elements (see 1925) had not uncovered them all. In 1929 Giauque (see 1925) found that of every 10,000 oxygen atoms, 9,976 indeed had a mass of 16, which was the atomic weight of oxygen. This very common isotope was therefore called oxygen-16. However, of the remaining 24 atoms, 4 had a mass of 17 and 20 a mass of 18. These were called oxygen-17 and oxygen-18.

This was upsetting news, since oxygen atoms had been used for a century as the standard against which atomic weights could be determined. If oxygen was a mixture of isotopes, with the mixture varying a bit (perhaps) from place to place and from time to time, it wouldn't serve as a standard. There were suggestions that oxygen-16 be used as a standard, even though that meant that all atomic weights would have to be slightly altered. Eventually, the commonest isotope of carbon, carbon-12, was accepted as standard, since this would entail less change in the value of atomic weights generally.

1928,Deoxyribose,['Levene'],[],"Levene had identified the sugar in some molecules of nucleic acid as ribose (see 1909). There were other nucleic acids from which a sugar that was not ribose could be obtained, but it was not till 1929 that Levene could identify that other sugar. It turned out to be deoxyribose, which had a molecule just like that of ribose except for a missing oxygen atom.

That meant that there were two types of nucleic acid: ribosenucleic acid and deoxyribonucleic acid, usually abbreviated as RNA and DNA, respectively. It was DNA that was found in chromosomes.

1928,Heme,"['Hans Fischer', 'Heme', 'Fischer']",['German'],"For ten years the German chemist Hans Fischer (1881—1945) had been puzzling out the structure of heme, the complex molecular group that joined with protein to form hemoglobin. It was heme that supplied blood’s color, that contained the iron atom, and that did the work of picking up oxygen at the lungs and giving it up at the cells.

Heme was not composed of amino acids, as proteins were. It was a nonprotein adjunct of the mole-

cule, which consisted of a porphyrin ring, four small rings of atoms connected into a larger ring. Attached to this ring of rings were eight side chains, four of one kind, two of another, and two of still another.

Once Fischer had the general structure worked out, he realized that the side chains could be arranged in any of fifteen different ways. He organized his students into groups and had them each set about synthesizing a different arrangement. Fischer then checked them all to see which arrangement had the properties of the natural substance.

By 1929 he had the structure of heme worked out to the last of its seventy-five atoms, and for this he was awarded the Nobel Prize for chemistry in 1930.

1928,Estrone,"['Edward Adelbert Doisy', 'Adolf Friedrich Butenandt']","['Males', 'American', 'German', 'Greek']","Males and females of the same species develop differently. The sex organs arise out of similar structures, but though the penis and the clitoris are homologous, they are very different in appearance and function. The male grows a larger larynx, the female larger breasts, the subcutaneous fat distribution and the hair pattern are different in the two sexes, and so on.

It wasn't very difficult to suppose that hormones were involved and that, like the organs whose development they controlled, they were similar but different in the two sexes.

In 1929 the American biochemist Edward Adelbert Doisy (1893-1986) and, working independently, the German chemist Adolf Friedrich Butenandt (b. 1903) isolated a female sex hormone, which came to be called estrone, from the Greek word for “sexual heat.”

1928,Intrinsic Factor,"['Murphy', 'William Bosworth Castle', 'Castle']","['Minot', 'American']","Minot and Murphy had found that some vitamin in liver relieved pernicious anemia (see 1926). The American physiologist William Bosworth Castle (b. 1897) noted that although diet could prevent pernicious anemia from developing in most patients, it did not cure the few who actually developed the disease. He reasoned that, ifa vitamin was involved, those who had trouble absorbing it even when it was present in the diet were the ones who came down with pernicious anemia.

Since patients with pernicious anemia had a characteristic lack of hydrochloric acid in their

gastric juice, Castle suggested, in 1929, that it was some component of normal gastric juice that brought about the absorption of the antipernicious-anemia vitamin. He called that missing component intrinsic factor.

1928,Electroencephalography,"['Einthoven', 'Hans Berger']","['German', 'Greek']","Einthoven had developed methods for detecting the rise and fall of electric potentials involved in the heartbeat and devised the electrocardiogram (see 1903).

The German psychiatrist Hans Berger (1873— 1941) thought the same might be done for the brain. During the 1920s he devised a system of electrodes that, when applied to the skull and connected to an oscillograph, would give a recording of the rhythmic shifting of electric potentials commonly called brain waves.

In 1929 he published his results, describing alpha waves and beta waves. In this way, electroencephalography (Greek for “the writing of brain electricity"") was developed. It offered a technique for the diagnosis of such serious brain disorders as tumors and epi-

lepsy.

He inserted a catheter (a long, thin, flexible rod that was opaque to X rays) into a vein in his own elbow and pushed it along the vein until it reached the heart. This made it possible to study the structure and function of an ailing heart and to make accurate diagnoses without the necessity of exploratory surgery.

The technique was not used clinically for over a decade, but Forssmann was awarded a share of the Nobel Prize for physiology and medicine in 1956.

1930,Child Development,['Jean Piaget'],['Swiss'],"By 1929 the Swiss psychologist Jean Piaget (1896— 1980) had worked out his observations on child development. By observing and asking questions, he

learned much. He also developed what he called conservation tasks: he made changes in simple objects and studied whether children could tell what had  not changed. For instance, if one pours water from a broad low vessel into a tall thin vessel, the height of the liquid increases. This may be taken to imply that there is more water, but

after a certain stage of development the child recognizes that the quantity of water has not changed. Piaget described four phases of mental growth, paralleling the physical

growth taking place, and maintained that all children went through the same phases in the same order.

1930,Pluto,"['Neptune', 'Adams', 'Uranus', 'Neptune Lowell', 'Clyde William Tombaugh', 'Tombaugh', 'Gemini', 'Pluto', 'Percival Lowell', 'Pluto Uranus']","['Leverrier', 'Uranus', 'Neptune', 'Martian', 'American']","Neptune had been discovered by Adams and Leverrier (see 1846) because Uranus was not moving in its orbit exactly as it should, so that the gravitational field of a more distant planet was suspected. Neptune's presence reduced but did not entirely wipe out the discrepancies

in Uranus’s orbit, and some astronomers thought that a still more distant but fairly large planet might exist beyond Neptune.

Lowell, who was so enthusiastic about Martian canals (see 1877), was also enthusiastic about this “Planet X"" and spent much of his time calculating its possible orbit and then searching for it. He died

without having found it, but at Lowell Observatory, which he had founded, the search went on.

The American astronomer Clyde William Tombaugh (b. 1906) continued the search methodically His technique was to take two pictures of the same small part of the sky on two different days. Each of these would show from

50,000 to 400,000 stars. Despite all those stars, the two plates would be identical if the spots of light were stars, and only stars. If the two plates were projected on a screen in rapid alternation, none of the stars would seem to move. If one of the “‘stars” was really a planet, however, one that had moved against the starry background during the interval between photographs, as the plates were alternately thrown upon the screen, that one object would seem to dart back and forth,

On February 18, 1930, Tombaugh found such a flicker in the constellation Gemini. From the smallness of the shift, the object had to be moving very slowly and must therefore lie beyond Neptune. On March 13, 1930, the seventy-fifth anniversary of Lowell’s birth, the discovery was announced. The new planet was named Pluto, first because that god of the nether darkness was appropriate to a planet swinging farthest out from the light of the Sun, and second because the first two letters were the initials of Percival Lowell.

In time, though, Pluto turned out to be a small planet incapable of influencing Uranus’s orbit measurably. The possibility of

another large planet beyond Neptune therefore remains to this day.

1930,Surface Temperature of the Moon,"['Nicholson', 'Jupiter IX', 'Nicholson Edison Pettit', 'Antarctica', 'Earth']",[],"Nicholson, who discovered Jupiter IX (see 1914), also developed sensitive heatmeasuring devices that could determine the surface temperature of an astronomical body such as the Moon from the amount of heat it delivered to the instrument. By using it he could show that the surface temperature of the Moon dropped nearly 200° C during the period of its eclipse by the Earth'’s shadow. The Moon had no ocean or atmosphere to conserve and circulate heat, and its solid body was so poor a heatconductor that the surface lost a great deal of heat before any new supply could work its way upward from the deeper layers.

In 1930 Nicholson and Edison Pettit obtained the first reasonably accurate measurement of the temperature of the lunar surface. As corrected by work since, it seems that the sunlit side of the Moon reaches a maximum temperature of 117° C, which is well above the boiling point of water. The night side of the Moon,

after two weeks without sun, sinks to a temperature, just before dawn, of —169° C, far colder than Antarctica at its coldest.

Since the Moon is at Earth’s average distance from the Sun, we see how fortunate it is that Earth has a faster spin and shorter day, an ocean to conserve heat, and an atmosphere to distribute it.

1930,Coronagraph,['Lyot'],"['Venus', 'French']","For two centuries, astronomers had been traveling the world in order to witness rare astronomical events that were not easily visible in other places and at other times. Examples are the far southern stars, total eclipses of the Sun, and transits of Venus and of Mercury.

One of the rare sights, from the point of view of both beauty and scientific interest, was the Sun's pearly upper atmosphere, or corona, in which helium was first discovered (see 1868).

In 1930 the French astronomer BernardFerdinand Lyot (1897— 1952) devised the coronagraph, a telescope that focused the light of the Sun on an opaque disk, cutting out all scattered light from the atmosphere and from the lens itself. Mounting a

telescope in the clear air of the Pyrenees, Lyot managed to observe the inner corona, at least, of the uneclipsed Sun. This meant that astronomers no longer had to wait for total eclipses to study the corona and its spectrum.

"
1930,Schmidt Camera,['Bernhard Voldemar Schmidt'],"['German', 'Schmidt']","One of the difficulties with the large telescopes of the twentieth century was that they could focus on such a tiny part of the sky. It was like looking at the Universe through a keyhole. Any attempt to enlarge the view resulted in inadmissable distortion.

In 1930 the Estonianborn German optician Bernhard Voldemar Schmidt (1879-1935) devised a special corrector plate, a small glass object with a complicated shape that could be placed near the focus of a spherical mirror. The corrector plate bent the light waves in such a way as to eliminate distortion, so that even wide fields could be enlarged steadily.

An instrument outfitted with such a mirror and corrector plate is called a Schmidt telescope, or, since it is invariably used with a photographic plate rather

than an eye receiving the light, a Schmidt camera. Used in conjunction with a conventional telescope, it can locate the interesting spots, on which the keen peephole of the telescope can then be focused.

"
1930,Interstellar Matter,"['Robert Julius Trumpler', 'Galaxy', 'Shapley']",['American'],"Three centuries earlier, it had come to be understood that there was a vacuum between the astronomical bodies. It was all too easy then to assume that the vacuum was perfect; that there was really nothing at all once one got outside any atmosphere that might be clinging to the immediate surface of a body.

In 1930, however, the Swiss-born American astronomer Robert Julius Trumpler (1886—1956) noted that the light of the more distant globular clusters was dimmer than would be expected from their sizes. The more distant the cluster, the more marked this departure from the expected brightness. What's more, the more distant the cluster, the redder the light.

The easiest way of explaining this was to suppose that space, even far from sizable bodies, was not a perfect vacuum. (In-

deed, a perfect vacuum does not exist and probably cannot exist in the Universe.) There are thin wisps of gas and dust throughout interstellar space, and over vast distances, there is enough of this—of dust, particularly—to dim and redden light. By taking the dimming effect of this interstellar matter into account, the size of the Galaxy was shown to be somewhat smaller than Shapley's toolarge estimates (see 1918).

"
1930,Antimatter,"['Davisson', 'Thomson', 'Paul Adrien Maurice Dirac', 'Dirac', 'Dirac Dirac']",['British'],"The demonstration by Davisson and Thomson that electron waves really existed (see 1927) encouraged the British physicist Paul Adrien Maurice Dirac (1902-1984) to develop the mathematics of electron waves.

From the equations he derived, it seemed to him that electrons and protons (the only two subatomic particles then known) had to exist in two energy states, one positive and one negative. At first Dirac assumed that the electron and proton themselves represented the two energy states and were fundamentally the same particle.

That would have been a great simplification of subatomic physics, but it didn't stand up. The proton  and electron were too different in too many ways, notably in mass.

In 1930 Dirac suggested that both the electron and proton, as known, were in the positive state, but that each could exist in a negative state as well. That is, there should be a particle precisely like the negatively charged electron in every way except that it had a positive electric charge, and there should be a particle precisely like the positively charged proton in every way except that it had a negative electric charge.

These negative-state particles came to be thought of eventually as antiparticles—an antielectron and an antiproton— and it was not difficult to imagine that, just as protons and electrons made up matter, so antiprotons and antielectrons, if they actually existed, would make up antimatter.

Dirac was correct, they did exist, and he was awarded a share (along with Schrodinger—see 1926) of the Nobel Prize for physics in 1933.

"
1930,Cyclotron,"['Ernest Orlando Lawrence', 'Lawrence']","['Walton', 'American']","The particle accelerator developed by Cockeroft and Walton (see 1929) forced particles to travel in a

straight line, faster and faster, thus piling up more and more energy, while being pushed on ahead by a magnetic field. The difficulty with this was that in order to get really high energies, the device had to be inconveniently long.

It seemed to the American physicist Ernest Orlando Lawrence (1901 — 1958) that, instead of pushing the particles ever onward, it might be handier to make them travel in circles, giving them a magnetic-field push each time they came around.

In 1930, therefore, he built a small device in which protons were made to travel between the poles of a large magnet that deflected their paths into cir-

cles. At each turn, they received another push of electric potential. This made them travel faster and therefore in a path that, under the constant force of the magnet, curved less sharply. The path was a sort of spiral that brought them closer and closer to the rim of the instrument. By the time the charged particles finally shot out of the instrument altogether, they had accumulated high energies indeed.

Lawrence called the device a cyclotron, because the particles moved in cycles. His first device was quite small, but it produced more energetic particles than a very long voltage multiplier would have.

For this, Lawrence was awarded the Nobel prize for physics in 1939.

He was defeated by the fact that mechanical methods of the day were, by and large, too coarse to do the work.

By the 1920s, engineers had at their disposal electric currents, together with radio tubes to control those currents. These cut down on the number of moving parts needed and supplied a much more delicate way of controlling the parts of what came to be called a compuiter,

In 1930 the American electrical engineer Vannevar Bush (1890-1974) produced the first machine capable of solving differential equations and the first one that Babbage would have recognized as fulfilling his design. However, Bush's computer was only partly electronic.

urease and shown that one enzyme at least was a pro-

tein (see 1926). He had little reputation in the field, however, and biochemists generally hesitated to accept his results in the face of contrary views by much betterknown biochemists such as Willstatter (see 1906).

In 1930, however, the American biochemist John Howard Northrop (1891— 1987) managed to crystallize, not a rather off-beat enzyme such as urease, but the very well-known digestive enzyme pepsin and showed it to be a protein. That really settled the matter (especially when Northrop went on to crystallize other well-known enzymes as well).

The result was that Northrop was awarded a share (along with Sumner) of the Nobel Prize for chemistry in 1946.

Vitamin A Structure

Vitamins had been known and worked with and used in nutrition and medicine for a third of a century, but they still remained mysterious, because their molecular structure was not known.

In 1930, however, the Swiss chemist Paul Karrer (1889-1971) showed that vitamin A was related to the carotenoids, of which the

most familiar is carotene, the coloring matter of carrots. Other carotenoids are found in sweet potatoes, egg volk, tomatoes, lobster shells, and human skin.

Vitamin A rather resembled half a molecule of carotene. This was finally proved when Karrer eventually synthesized it, which led to a rash of molecular determinations and syntheses of other vitamins, and the mystery (of their structure, at least) was removed.

1931,Freon,"['Thomas Midgley', 'Freon']",['American'],"By now, refrigerators and air-conditioners existed, and general use was made of liquids that could be evaporated and so draw heat from the surrounding environment, thus lowering the temperature, as in the method used for liquefying gases.

The main trouble was that the gases used for the purpose were ammonia and sulfur dioxide, for the most part, and that these had choking odors and were actually poisonous, so that leaks in the system were bound to be uncomfortable and might be dangerous.

It would be ideal if one could find a liquid that was odorless, easily evaporated, nonpoisonous, and stable.

Just such a liquid was  discovered by the American chemist Thomas Midgley, Jr. (see 1921). In 1930 he prepared difluoredichloromethane, with a molecule consisting of a carbon atom to which two chlorine atoms and two fluorine atoms were attached. It had all the properties needed for refrigeration.

It belonged to the class of chlorofluorocarbons, and other molecules of the class had uses too. For example, such liquids could be used in spray cans to force other liquids out in a fine mist.

Trademarked preparations of the liquid, like Freon, rapidly went into use. They made air-condi-

tioners common and, indeed, in developed societies, nearly universal equipment. Eventually

however, the chlorofluorocarbons were found to have dangers that at the time of their discovery could not have been foreseen, and their use is now being increasingly discouraged.

1931,Godel’s Proof,"['Frege', 'Kurt Godel', 'Gadel', 'Godel', 'Godel Heisenberg']",['Austrian'],"Thirty years earlier, Frege had attempted to place all of mathematics on a formal logical basis, making it fully rigorous, and had failed (see 1902). Other, more elaborate attempts followed.

An Austrian mathematician, Kurt Godel (1906— 1978), put a final end to

such schemes in 1931 by advancing what is now called Gadel's proof. He translated the symbols of symbolic logic into numbers in a systematic way and showed that it was always possible to construct a number that could not be arrived at from the other numbers of his system.

What it amounted to was this; Godel showed

that if you began with any set of axioms, there would always be statements within the system governed by those axioms that could be neither proved nor disproved on the basis of those axioms. If the axioms were modified in such a way that the statement could be either proved or disproved, then another statement could be constructed that

could be neither proved nor disproved in the new system, and so on forever,

Godel had thus ended the search for certainty in mathematics by showing that it did not and could not exist, just as Heisenberg had in physics (see 1927).

However, Godel's proof does not affect the nittygritty of ordinary mathematics. Two plus two is still four.

1931,Neutrino,"['Generally', 'Pauli', 'Fermi']",['Italian'],"For over a decade, physicists had been plagued with the problem of beta-particle emission. Beta particles might be fired out of a nucleus with all the energy to be expected from the loss in mass as one nucleus broke down into another. Generally, though, they came out with less energy, and to an unpredictable degree. They sometimes emerged with very little energy, in fact, and some physicists, in despair, felt that the law of conservation of energy simply didn't hold in connection with beta-particle emission.

In 1931, however, Pauli, who had worked out the exclusion principle (see 1925), suggested an explanation that did not violate energy conservation. He suggested that, along with

the electron, another particle was given off, and that

the energy was divided between the electron and the other particle in a random manner.

Since the electron had all the electric charge available, the other particle had to be electrically uncharged, or neutral. Since all the kinetic energy of an electron could be converted into only a tiny quantity of mass, the other particle would have little or no mass.

The next year Fermi, who had devised a mathematical treatment for electron distribution (see 1926), named the other particle the neutrino (Italian for “little neutral one"").

Since it lacked both mass and electric charge, the neutrino was sure to be very difficult to detect, assuming it existed at all, and for a quarter of a century it remained a kind of “ghost particle,” with theoretical reasons for existing but backed by no observational evidence.

217,Deuterium,"['Harold Clayton Urey', 'Urey']","['American', 'Greek']","As more and more stable elements proved to be made up of mixtures of isotopes, there was considerable feeling that even the lightest and simplest of the elements, hydrogen, ought to consist of isotopes. Hydro-

gen has an atomic weight of very close to 1, so that if it did consist of isotopes, hydrogen-1 must be overwhelmingly the most common. Still, there might be very small quantities of hydrogen-2 present.

The American chemist Harold Clayton Urey (1893—-1981) tackled the problem in 1931. He reasoned that hydrogen-2, being the more massive atom, would be less easily evaporated than hydrogen1. If, then, he slowly evaporated a large quantity of liquid hydrogen, the final bit of liquid ought to have a percentage of hydrogen-2 larger than that in the supply he began with.

Now if hydrogen-2 were present, its spectral lines ought to have slightly different wavelengths than those of hydrogen-1, and the ordinary hydrogen spectrum ought to have, accompanying each spectral line, a very faint one nearby— too faint to be sure of.

However, when most of the liquid hydrogen had evaporated, leaving an unusually high concentration of hydrogen-2, the hydrogen-2 lines ought to become more prominent and should be unmistakable.

This turned out to be 50, and Urey announced the discovery at once.

Hydrogen-2 came to be called heavy hydrogen or deuterivom (from the Greek word for “two""). For this discovery, Urey was awarded the Nobel Prize for chemistry in 1934.

217,Resonance,"['London', 'Linus Carl Pauling', 'Pauling']",['American'],"Four years earlier, London had applied quantum mechanics to the electronsharing between hydrogen atoms in the hydrogen molecule. In 1931 the American chemist Linus Carl Pauling (b. 1901) extended this to the electron-sharing in organic compounds generally.

Consider the benzene molecule, for instance. It consists of six carbon atoms in a hexagonal ring, with one hydrogen atom attached to each carbon atom. Such a ring must have single bonds and double bonds in alternation. Double bonds in ordinary organic compounds represent a region of activity where two hydrogen atoms can easily be added. In the case of benzene, however, the double bonds are stable and are difficult to add to. The great stability of the benzene ring was a puzzle. Some suggested that the double bonds switched endlessly, so that any given adjacent pair of atoms were

connected by a single bond and a double bond in rapid alternation.

Pauling showed in 1931, however, that if all the atoms of a molecule were in a single plane (as was true of benzene) and symmetrically placed (as was again true of benzene), then the electron waves would spread out over the carbon atoms generally, so that what connected the carbon atoms was neither an ordinary single bond nor an ordinary double bond but something intermediate between the two. This spreading out of the electrons (resonance) represented a very stable conformation, and any molecule increased in stability where there was an opportunity for resonance.

The concept of resonance helped greatly in explaining the manner of chemical reactions and made them far more predictable. For this, and for his work on chemical structure made possible by the concept of resonance, Pauling was awarded the Nobel Prize for chemistry in 1954,

It is produced by cells of the testicle and stimulates the type of development required to produce the characteristics of the adult male. Butenandt isolated only 15 milligrams of the hormone (a two-thousandth of an ounce), but by delicate microanalytical methods, he was able to make two analyses of the compound.

217,Neoprene,"['Rubber', 'Brazil', 'Julius Arthur Nieuwland', 'Nieuwland']","['Malaya', 'Europe', 'America', 'American']","Rubber had become a vital resource in an age of automobiles. Its use in tires was essential, and it had a myriad of other uses as well. The major producer of rubber was originally Brazil, but production had been transferred to Malaya. The possibility of such a distant source being cut off in time of war or political unrest made it advisable, even imperative, that the industrial nations of Europe and

America devise some sort of synthetic rubber that could be made at home.

One of those involved in the search was a Belgian-born American chemist, Julius Arthur Nieuwland (1878—1936). His researches uncovered the fact that acetylene, a compound with a molecule made up of two carbon’ atoms and two hydrogen atoms, could polymerize; that is, add other atoms onto itself to form a long chain of atoms. At some stage, this chain gained some of the properties of rubber.

Nieuwland found that if, at the four-carbon stage, chlorine atoms were attached, the resulting chain was far more like rubber. By 1931 he had what was called neoprene. This kept essential facets of the American economy rolling later when the rubber supply was indeed cut off.

ican chemist Wallace Hume Carothers (1896— 1937) that an artificial polymer might be prepared that had the properties of silk. He had worked on polymers along with Nieuwland and had helped synthesize neoprene (see above).

Carothers began working with compounds called diamines and dicarboxylic acids. These combine alternately to form the same types of connections that amino acids do. In 1931 Carothers found a polymeric fiber that, after stretching, proved even stronger than silk. It was eventually called nylon, and the time was to come when it would replace silk to a very large extent.

217,Virus Particles,['William Joseph Elford'],"['Beijerinck', 'English']","Since the existence of viruses had first been demonstrated by Beijerinck (see 1898), some forty diseases (including measles, mumps, chickenpox, influenza, smallpox, poliomyelitis, rabies, and the common cold) had been found to

be caused by viruses, but their nature remained a mystery.

In 1931, an English bacteriologist, William Joseph Elford (1900-1952), managed to trap some in filters. He used fine collodion

<1

membranes, graded to keep out smaller and smaller particles. From the fineness of the membrane that could filter out the agents capable of producing a given disease, he could judge the size of that particular virus. He found that viruses were smaller than even the smallest bacteria, but that even the smallest viruses were larger than most molecules. Viruses, in other words, were objects that ranged in size from that of large protein molecules to nearly that of tiny bacteria.

1932,Virus Culture,"['Virus', 'Ernest William Goodpasture', 'Stratospheric Balloons Human', 'Auguste Piccard', 'Piccard']","['American', 'Swiss']","A great deal of the success in dealing with bacterial disease came about because it was possible to grow pure colonies of bacteria in glassware and study them in detail. Virus diseases presented a more intricate puzzle, because viruses would only multiply inside living cells.

In 1931, however, the American pathologist Ernest William Goodpasture (1886—1960) devised a technique for culturing viruses in eggs, which are, after all, living cells. This technique made it possible eventually to develop vaccines for a number of viral diseases, notably poliomyelitis.  Stratospheric Balloons

Human beings had reached heights of up to 6 miles in balleons but had done so

at great peril, for the air is not dense enough at such heights to be thoroughly capable of supporti i 1902). Uncrewed balloons were used to reach greater heights,

This was not satisfactory to the Swiss physicist Auguste Piccard (1884— 1962), who wanted to study the ionosphere and cosmic rays more intimately than the instruments of the day made possible. What had to be done, he felt, was to construct a sealed aluminum gondola within which a normal atmosphere could be maintained however high the balloon climbed.

In 1931, making use of such a sealed gondola, Piccard ascended to a height of nearly 10 miles, half again as high as human beings had ever risen before. This paved the way for other and even higher penetrations of the stratosphere by himself and others. Eventually, heights of nearly 20 miles were achieved.

203,Neutron,"['Uhlenbeck', 'Goudsmit', 'James Chadwick', 'Chadwick', 'Chadwick Heisenberg']","['English', 'Heisenberg']","For twenty years, it had been assumed that the atomic nucleus was made up of protons and electrons, since these were the only two subatomic particles known. Thus the nitrogen nucleus had a mass of 14,

so it must contain fourteen protons. On the other hand, the nitrogen nucleus had an electric charge of +7, whereas fourteen protons would have an electric charge of +14. Therefore, the nucleus must have seven electrons with a charge of —1 each to neu-

tralize the charge of seven of those protons. The net result was that the nitrogen nucleus was theught to be made up of 14 protons and 7 electrons, or 21 particles altogether.

But seven years earlier, when Uhlenbeck and Goudsmit worked out the con

cept of particle spin (see 1925), it had become clear that something was wrong with the proton-electron notion of nuclear structure. Protons and electrons both had a spin of either +'2 or — 4, If twenty-one such spins, or in fact any odd number of such spins, were added up (regardless of the distribution of pluses and minuses), the total spin should be one of the halfintegers: Y2, or 1'%, or 2%, and so on. The actual measured spin of the nitrogen nucleus, however, was an integer. The nucleus, therefore, could not contain an odd number of particles but had to contain an even number. There were other nuclei that shared this anomalous characteristic.

If the proton-electron combination could be counted as a single particle, however, then the nitrogen nucleus would contain seven protons and seven proton-electron combinations, for fourteen particles —an even number.

A proton-electron combination would have the mass of a proton but would carry no electric charge. If such a neutral particle existed, however, it would be difficult to detect, for the various devices for detecting subatomic particles all depended on the electric

charge these particles carried.

In 1930 Bothe, who had devised the coincidence counter (see 1929), became aware of strange radiations emerging from beryllium that had been exposed to bombardment with alpha particles, but he couldn't tell what the radiation consisted of.

In 1932, however, the English physicist James Chadwick (1891-1974) repeated the experiments and maintained that the best way of explaining the observations was to suppose that the alpha particles knocked neutral particles out of the beryllium nucleus. These particles could not be detected directly, since they lacked an electric charge, but they succeeded in knocking protons out of the atomic nuclei in paraffin, and those protons could be detected. A radiation capable of ejecting protons must consist of particles with a mass in the proton range, and a particle possessing the mass of a proton and no charge was just the thing to represent a proton-electron pair and yet be one particle and not two. The new particle was called a neutron, and it proved to be by far the most useful particle for initiating nuclear reactions.

For his discovery of the

neutron, Chadwick was awarded the Nobel Prize for physics in 1935.

ProtonNeutron Nucleus

As soon as the neutron was discovered by Chadwick (see above), Heisenberg (see 1925) pointed out that the atomic nucleus must be made up of protons and neutrons rather than protons and electrons.

Thus the nitrogen nucleus with a charge of +7 must contain seven protons. Since it had a mass of 14, it must also contain seven neutrons. That would mean fourteen particles altogether, and fourteen particles, each with with a spin of +'2 or — ', would add up to a total spin that was an integer no matter how you distributed the pluses and minuses. Given a proton-neutron nucleus, all nuclear spins turned out to match what was expected, and all spin anomalies disappeared.

What's more, the proton-neutron picture clearly explained the existence of isotopes. The nuclei of all atomns of oxygen, for instance, must contain eight protons, but the common oxygen-16 nucleus

must contain eight protons and eight neutrons, the oxygen-17 nucleus eight protons and nine neutrons, and the oxygen-18 nucleus eight protons and ten neutrons. In the case of hydrogen, the hydrogen-1 nucleus must contain a proton only, with the hydrogen-2 nucleus containing one proton and one neutron.

This new view of the nucleus solved the spin problem but introduced a new problem of its own. If the tiny nucleus were filled with protons, all of which were positively charged, there must be an intense repulsion among them. The neutrons, being uncharged, would do nothing te reduce the repulsion. How then account for the fact that the nucleus clings together strongly? (As long as it was thought that electrons existed in the nucleus, they might be viewed as a kind of cement, but that possibility was now gone.)

Heisenberg suggested that exchange forces might exist. In other words, the proton and neutron might exchange particles in such a way that a strong attraction would be produced, since the particles could not be exchanged unless the proton and neutron remained very close to-

gether. It took a few years for this notion to be properly developed.

203,Positron,"['Dirac', 'Carl David Anderson', 'Anderson', 'Anderson Dirac', 'Anderson Anderson']","['American', 'Millikan']","Dirac had predicted, from theoretical considerations, that there must be a particle just like the electron but with a positive charge rather than a negative one (see 1930). However, such an antielectron had not been observed in nature.

The American physicist Carl David Anderson (b. 1905) was working with Millikan (see 1911) on cosmic rays. To carry out his studies, he had devised a cloud chamber (see 1911) with a lead partition running across it. A cosmic ray particle entering an ordinary cloud chamber was so energetic that a magnetic field scarcely managed to deflect it at all, and from the virtually straight-line trace that resulted, not much information about it could be derived. If a lead partition was placed in the chamber, the cosmic ray particle had energy enough to smash through it but lost enough energy in the process to allow it to be easily deflected on the far side of the partition.

In 1932, while conducting research with his lead-partitioned cloud

chambers, Anderson noted tracks emerging from the lead that were clearly electron tracks (experienced researchers could read tracks at a glance). The only peculiarity was that the electron tracks curved in the wrong direction. Anderson had found the positively charged particle that Dirac had predicted—the antielectron. Anderson, however, thought of it as a positive electron and gave it the shortened name of positron, which it has carried ever since.

For his discovery, Anderson was awarded the Nobel Prize for physics in 1936, sharing it with Hess, who had discovered cosmic rays (see 1911).

203,Particle Accelerator and Nuclear Reaction,"['Radio', 'Static', 'Karl Guthe Jansky', 'Jansky', 'Jansky Jansky', 'Shapley']","['Rutherford', 'Cock', 'Walton', 'Space', 'Sagittarius']","The first human-made nuclear reaction had been carried through by Rutherford (see 1919). For the purpose, he had used alpha particles produced naturally by radioactive sources. Other nuclear reactions brought about since then had also made use of such alpha particles.

In 1932, however, Cock

croft and Walton, who had devised the first particle accelerator (see 1929), used protons from such an accelerator to bombard lithium nuclei. This made alpha particles come streaking out of the lithium nuclei.

The lithium nucleus is made up of three protons and four neutrons. When accelerated protons are fired at such a nuclei, a proton will occasionally enter a nucleus, giving it four protons and four neutrons. This instantly breaks up into two alpha particles containing two protons plus two neutrons. In other words: hydrogen + lithium yields helium + helium.

This was the first nuclear reaction produced by human beings as a result of bombardment with artificially accelerated particles. It was to be the first of many.

Radio Waves from Space

As radio came more prominently into use for communication and home entertainment, the problem of static (a crackling interference that made communication uncertain and music unpleasant) cried out for correction. Static had a number of causes, includ-

ing thunderstorms, nearby electric equipment, and aircraft passing overhead.

The Bell Telephone Company, which needed radio for ship-to-shore calls, among other things, set one of its employees, Karl Guthe Jansky (1905— 1950), to exploring the problem.

Jansky detected a new kind of weak static from a source that at first he could not identify. [t came from overhead and moved steadily. At first it seemed to Jansky that it must be the Sun, However, the source gained slightly on the Sun to the extent of 4 minutes a day. This is just the amount by which the vault of the stars gains on the Sun, so that the source must lie beyond the Solar System.

By the spring of 1932, Jansky had decided that the source was in the constellation of Sagittarius, the direction in which Shapley had placed the center of our galaxy (see 1918).

This represented the birth of radio astronomy, in which astronomers learned to receive and interpret radio waves rather than light waves.

Light waves, of course, are easily perceived by the retina of the eye and by photographic film. In 1932, however, perceiving radio

L e

waves with any precision was extremely difficult, for instruments were lacking. Therefore, the development of radio astronomy was delayed for some twenty years.

203,Electron Microscope,"['Davisson', 'Ernst August Friedrich Ruska']","['German', 'Ruska']","Davisson had demonstrated that electrons did indeed have their wave aspects (see 1927). Therefore they might be manipulated in much the same way that light waves were. They might be focused as light waves were in microscopes, for instance.

The sharpness with which tiny objects can be seen varies inversely with the wavelength of the viewing medium. The shorter the wavelength, the smaller the objects that can be made out. Since electron waves have a wavelength equal to that of X rays (but are much easier to focus than X rays), an electron niicroscope should be much more powerful than an ordinary optical microscope.

Electron waves cannot be focused by passing them through lenses, of course, but they can be focused by appropriate magnetic fields. The German electrical engineer Ernst August Friedrich Ruska (1906—

1988) built the first such instrument in 1932. It was a crude affair, to be sure, but it was capable of magnifying four hundred times. It was rapidly improved and became an essential item in the microscopists’ armory.

For his work, Ruska was belatedly awarded a share in the Nobel Prize for physics in 1986.

It was clear that possible chemicals for the purpose lay among the dyes. Some dyes combined with cells and not with others, so surely there should be some dyes that combined with germs, killing them in the process, without affecting human cells.

The German biochemist Gerhard Domagk (1895— 1964) conducted systematic tests of new dyes synthesized since the time of Ehrlich to see if he could find something appropriate. One of them was a newly synthesized orange-red compound with the trade name Prontosil. In 1932 Domagk found that injections

of the dye had a powerful curative effect on streptococcus infection in mice.

As it happened, Domagk’s young daughter, Hildegard, had been infected by streptococci following the prick of a needle. When other treatment failed, Domagk injected large quantities of Prontosil. She recovered, and the world had another item in its chemotherapeutic armory. Prontosil was the forerunner of a large number of drugs that would cause many infectious diseases to lose their terrors.

For this discovery, Domagk was awarded the Nobel Prize for medicine and physiology in 1939. (Hitler refused to allow Germans to accept Nobel Prizes, however, because a Peace Prize had been awarded to Carl von Ossietzky [1889-1938], an imprisoned German pacifist. Domagk was therefore not able to aceept his prize formally till 1947.)

six-carbon molecule closely resembling those of the sugars and was named ascorbic acid, from Greek words meaning ‘'no scurvy.” The work of Lind (see 1747) was thus successfully concluded.

Two weeks later, SzentGyorgyi reported that his hexuronic acid (see 1928) was vitamin C, and he was right. This set off a violent and bitter controversy over precedence, which continued throughout the long lives of both men (each lived into his 90s).

Often the chain moved from its starting point back to that same point after a number of steps (forming a cycle), achieving some result with each turn of that cycle.

Thus the German-born British biochemist Hans Adolf Krebs (1900-1981) showed that when the amino acid arginine broke down and was reconstituted, it produced in the process a molecule of urea (so that it was called the urea cycle). Urea is the chief nitrogen-containing waste in mammals generally.

Some substitute for Iceland spar that would be cheaper and easier to work with would have been welcome, but none was known.

To be sure, there were certain organic crystals that behaved as Iceland spar did, but they did not readily produce crystals of the proper size, and the crystals would have been far too fragile to work with in any case.

An American inventor, Edwin Herbert Land (b. 1909), had the idea that a single crystal was not neces-

sary. A myriad of tiny crystals would do if all were oriented in the same direction.

In 1932 he devised methods of aligning the crystals and of then embedding them in clear plastic. When set, this served nicely to keep them from drifting out of alignment and made their fragility irrelevant The result was given the trade name Polaroid, and it quickly replaced Iceland spar in scientific instruments. It also came to be used in automobile windshields and in spectacles.

. . Quinacrine

Malaria, a widespread discase in the tropics and perhaps the most debilitating

disease, on the whole, that was suffered by the human species, had been treated with quinine for three centuries (see 1642). Quinine comes from the bark of a tropical tree, however, and the supply to the industrial nations might easily be cut off in wartime. The search was on for a substitute

The first satisfactory substitute to be found was quin

crine (also called Atabrin), first developed in Germany and established as a successful antimalarial in 1932. When net too many years afterward, war did indeed disrupt the quinine supply, the existence of quinacrine made it possible for troaps to operate in tropical regions.

o Synthetic Vitamin C King and Szent-Gyérgyi had succeeded in determining the molecular structure of vitamin C (see 1932).

In 1933 the Polish-born Swiss chemist Tadeus Reichstein (b. 1897) succeeded in synthesizing the vitamin. Eventually other vitamins were analyzed and then synthesized. This meant that it was no longer necessary to obtain small quantities of vitamins from huge quantities of foodstuff. Instead they could be synthesized in the laboratory by the pound and even by the ton. Nor were the synthetic vitamins in any way different from the natural ones.

The ability to synthesize vitamins led to the development and popularity of vitamin pills, and when these became available at affordable prices, the nutritional problem of vitamins in the diet was diminished or even abolished.

The English chemist Walter Norman Haworth (1883—1950) independently synthesized vitamin C not long after Reichstein did,

and it was Haworth who gave the vitamin the name of ascorbic acid. For Haworth’s work on sugars generally, he was awarded a share in the Nobel Prize for chemistry in 1937,

1934,Molecular Beams,"['Maxwell', 'Otto Stern', 'Stern', 'Stern Absolute Zero Debye', 'Giauque', 'Giauque Giaugque']",['American'],"If gases are allowed to escape from a container through a tiny hole into a high vacuum, the escaping molecules meet virtually no molecules with which they can collide. They therefore form a tight beam of moving particles. These molecular beams are made up of particles that are neutral but that are themselves made up of charged particles: nuclei and electrons.

As a result, in accordance with Maxwell's equations (see 1865), they ought to behave like tiny magnets.

The German-born American physicist Otto Stern (1888-1969) studied these molecular beams for years and by 1933 had conclusively demonstrated that they did behave like magnets and in ways, moreover, that also supported

quantum mechanics. Furthermore, Stern showed that the molecular beams possessed wave aspects.

For his work on molecular beams, Stern was awarded the Nobel Prize for physics in 1943.

Approach to Absolute Zero

Debye and Giauque had suggested a way of approaching absolute zero more closely by using magnetic techniques (see 1925).

In 1933 Giauque managed to turn theory into practice. He imposed a magnetic field on gadolinium sulfate, then let it retreat into disorder on the removal of the field. The retreat into disorder required heat and absorbed it from the surrounding helium. In this way he lowered its temperature to 0.25 degrees above absolute zero. By the end of a year, others using the same technique had reached 0.0185° K.

For this and for later work on ultracold temperatures, Giaugque was awarded the Nobel Prize for chemistry in 1949.

"
1934,Neutron Bombardment,"['Chadwick', 'Fermi']",['Fermi'],"As soon as Chadwick had discovered the neutron (see 1932), it was clear that it would be an extremely useful tool for the bombardment of nuclei. Protons and alpha particles, being positively charged, are repelled by the positively charged nuclei, and much of their energy must be expanded in overcoming this repulsion. Neutrons, being uncharged, can drift into a nucleus even when low in energy.

When a neutron is absorbed by the nucleus of a

particular atom, the new nucleus may be unstable and may emit a beta particle, which by subtracting a negative charge converts a neutron in the nucleus into a proton. The net result is that the nucleus ends up with one proton more than it started with, which makes it an element that is one higher in atomic number.

In 1934 it occurred to Fermi (see 1926 and 1931) that it would be particularly interesting to bombard uranium atoms with neutrons and perhaps form atoms with an atomic number of 93, which are not known in nature.

The results of the bombardment turned out to be confusing, and the confusion was not straightened out for five years—but then with portentous results. For his work on neutron bombardment generally, Fermi was awarded the Nobel Prize for physics in 1938.

"
1934,Weak Interaction,"['Pauli', 'Fermi', 'Rutherford', 'Frédéric JoliotCurie', 'Iréne', 'Marie Curie', 'Curies']","['French', 'Pierre']","Pauli had suggested that every time a beta particle was emitted by a nucleus, a neutrino (without charge or mass) was also emitted (see 1931).

In 1934 Fermi worked

out the theoretical basis on which the two particles were formed. He showed that there was an interaction involved in connection with neutrinos that was like an electromagnetic interaction but much weaker. It therefore came to be called the weak interaction. (It was stronger than the gravitational interaction, however.)

The electromagnetic interaction and the gravitational interaction decreased in intensity with the square of the distance. This was a rather slow decrease, so that both interactions could make themselves felt over long distances. (This was particularly true of the gravitational interaction, which was purely attractive, whereas the electromagnetic interaction had attractive and repulsive components that tended to cancel each other.)

The weak interaction, however, fell off so rapidly with distance that it was confined entirely to distances the size of an atomic nucleus or less. It might therefore have been called the nuclear interaction were it not that another interaction of small range was soon discovered.

o Artificial

Radioactivity Ever since Rutherford had brought about nuclear reactions by bombardment with subatomic particles (see 1919), physicists had been inducing more and more such reactions,

In 1934 the French physicists Frédéric JoliotCurie (1900-1958) and Iréne Joliot-Curie (1897— 1956), his wife, who was also the daughter of Pierre and Marie Curie (see 1897), were bombarding aluminum atoms with alpha particles.

In the process of the bombardment, the nucleus of the aluminum atom would absorb an alpha particle and give off a proton. The aluminum nucleus contains thirteen protons and fourteen neutrons, so that it is aluminum-27. By taking up an alpha particle (two protons and two neutrons) and then giving up a proton, it ended up with fourteen protons and sixteen neutrons, so that it was silicon-30, which occurs in nature.

However, after the bombardment ceased, so that alpha particles were no longer absorbed and protons were no longer given off, another form of radiation continued. The Joliot-

Curies investigated and decided that in some cases the aluminum nucleus, after absorbing the alpha particle, gave off a neutron. The result was a net gain of two protons and one neutron, for a total of fifteen protons and fifteen neutrons, which made it phosphorus-30.

Phosphorus-30, however, does not occur in nature, and it is radioactive, breaking down with a halflife of just under 3 minutes (which is why it doesn’t occur in nature). In breaking down, it gives off a stream of positrons (particles that had been discovered by Anderson—see 1932). Each escaping positron converts a proton to a neutron, so that phosphorus-30 becomes stable silicon-30.

The Joliot-Curies were thus the first to observe radioactive breakdowns that emitted positrons and were the first to produce a radioactive isotope of an ordinarily stable element. This is called artificial radioactivity, since it comes about as the result of bombardment of nuclei in the laboratory. Eventually it turned out that every element that possessed one or more stable types of nuclei could also possess radioactive nuclei (radioisotopes).

For the discovery of ar tificial radioactivity, the Joliot-Curies were awarded the Nobel Prize for chemistry in 1935.

However, light travels more slowly when passing through matter, and the decrease in speed is more marked as the index of refraction of the transparent medium increases. In water, light travels at 224,900 kilometers per second, and only 124,000 kilometers per second in diamond. The speed of light is even a bit below maximum when it is passing through air.

A rapidly moving particle can never travel faster than the speed of light in a vacuum, but it can travel faster than light does in water, let us say. And if the particle is moving extremely close to the speed of light in a vacuum, it may move faster in air than light does. When particles move faster than light in some medium other than a vacuum, they leave a wake of light trailing behind.

A Soviet physicist, Pavel Alekseyevich Cherenkov (b. 1904), was the first to observe this wake of radiation, which came to be called Cherenkov radiation as a result. The reason for the wake was explained by the Russian physicists Igor Yevgenyevich Tamm (1895-1971) and Ilya Mikhaylovich Frank (b. 1908).

From the angle at which Cherenkov radiation is emitted, the speed of ultrafast particles can be calculated, and for this finding, Cherenkov, Tamm, and Frank were awarded the Nobel Prize for physics in 1958.

Since then, three and a quarter centuries had passed without such a bright nova being seen. To be sure, from time to time new stars had been seen that were fairly bright and that qualified as novas, but none had attained a brightness surpassing that of Jupiter, or even Venus, as the novas of Tycho and Kepler had.

In 1885 a nova had appeared in the Andromeda nebula that had attained a brightness of magnitude 7, almost bright enough to see

s 7

with the unaided eye, but this had not been made much of at the time. When Hubble, however, showed that the Andromeda nebula was really a far distant galaxy (see 1923), the brightness of the 1885 nova had to be reassessed. To be nearly visible to the unaided eye from the vast distance of the Andromeda galaxy, it had to be enormously more luminous than the run-of-the-mill novas that had been seen since Kepler's time.

The Swiss astronomer Fritz Zwicky (1898-1974) pointed this out in 1934 and suggested that novas such as those Tycho and Kepler had seen and the one in the Andromeda galaxy were supernovas. Since Kepler's time, none had been seen in our own galaxy, but Zwicky, watching other galaxies, spotted a number. Since a supernova shines at its peak with a brilliance about equal to the total light of an average galaxy, a supernova can be seen as far as a galaxy can.

1934,Neutron Stars,['Zwicky'],['Zwicky'],"It seemed reasonable that when a star used up its nuclear fuel, its center would cool down. Without fierce central heat to keep its huge body bloated, it might collapse to a white dwarf

Zwicky (see above) suggested that in the case of supernovas, collapse might be extreme. After expending its energy, a supernova might collapse under its own gravitational pull till its subatomic particles (protons and electrons) were crushed together to form neutrons and the neutrons were forced into contact.

Such a neutron star might possess all the mass of a full-sized star and yet be only 8 miles across. Naturally, a neutron star would be difficult to detect, and it was not until thirtyfive years after Zwicky's suggestion that the detection was accomplished.

For this he shared the Nobel Prize for chemistry in 1939 with Butenandt. Meanwhile, also in 1934, Butenandt isolated progesterone, a female sex

hormone of vital importance to the chemical mechanisms involved in pregnancy. Butenandt, like Domagk (see 1932, Prontosil), could not accept the Nobel Prize because of Hitler’s ruling. It was not until 1949 that he could accept it formally.

Naturally they could not go very deep or stay very long.

Later they could stay underwater for extended periods in caissons or diving suits, but only at the cost of having the air they breathed compressed to the pressure of the surrounding water. This limited the depth to which they could penetrate and the time they could remain.

At high pressures, nitrogen dissolves in the blood and bubbles out when the pressure is relieved, causing the bends, or caisson disease, which results in agonizing pain and sometimes paralysis and death. To prevent this, pressure has to be released very slowly, a procedure first

suggested in 1878 by the French physiologist Paul Bert (1833—1886).

To achieve real depth for indefinite periods, it was clearly necessary to provide a sealed gondola capable of maintaining an interior at ordinary pressures, as Piccard had done for high-altitude balloons (see 1931). The task was more difficult at sea, for in the heights the difference between inside and outside pressure was less than one atmosphere, while in the depths the sea pressed in with many atmospheres of pressure.

The American naturalist Charles William Beebe (1877—-1962) devised the necessary steel vessel. It had thick quartz windows and was a sphere (at the suggestion of President Roosevelt) rather than a cylinder for greater strength.

In 1934 Beebe used this bathysphere (Greek for ""“sphere of the deep”) to descend to a record depth of 3,028 feet, nearly threefifths of a mile.

Nevertheless, it was not till 1935 that uranium was found to consist of two isotopes in its natural state. The common form had a nucleus made up of 92 protons and 146 neutrons, so that it was uranium-238. In 1935 the Canadian-born American physicist Arthur Jeffrey Dempster (1886—1950) showed that there was also another isotope, making up only 1 out of 140 uranium atoms, that had a nucleus

containing 92 protons and 143 neutrons, so that it was uranium-235.

There was no way of telling at the time of its discovery how enormously important uranium-235 was, but the demonstration came within a few

1934,Isotopic Tracers,"['Hevesy', 'Rudolf Schoenheimer', 'Schoenheimer']","['Urey', 'Deuterium', 'German']","Hevesy had first used radioactive atoms as tracers in biochemical work (see 1918). However, he had used radioactive lead, and lead is not a natural component of tissue, so that its presence might well have interrupted the natural flow of chemical reactions there

Since then, however, it had been found that ele-

ments that were not radioactive were also made up of isotopes. In particular, the four most common and important elements of tissue each existed also as an isotope that was relatively rare, quite stable, and capable of being differentiated from the common isotope. Thus there was carbon-13, which was 8.5 percent more massive than the ¢ mon carbon-12; nitrogen15,7.1 percent more massive than the common nitrogen-14; oxygen-18, 12.5 percent more massive than

the easier it was to analvz

for the unusual isotope, so that hydrogen-2, discovered by Urey (see 1931, Deuterium), should be particularty useful.

The German biochemist Rudolf Schoenheimer (1898-1941) obtained a quantity of hydrogen-2 from Urey and used it to form fat molecules that contained a considerably higher percentage of hydrogen-2 than would be found in natural fat.

Samples of this isotopeenriched fat were fed to rats. It was assumed that the tissues would not differentiate between the two hydrogen isotopes but would treat hydrogen-2 exactly like hydrogen-1. After a time, a rat could be killed and its body fat analyzed for hydrogen-2, which would have acted as an isotopic tracer, indicating the types of reactions that fat molecules underwent. By 1935 he had achieved surprising results.

For instance, until then it had been believed that the fat stores of an organism were usually immobile, remaining where they were until such time as famine demanded their use. Under ordinary conditions, it was thought, the body would make use of fat obtained from the immediate diet.

However, Schoenheimer found that when iso-

tope-enriched fat was fed to rats, half of what had been fed was to be found in the fat stores. In other words, ingested fat was stored, and stored fat was used. There was a rapid turnover, and body constituents were not static but changed constantly and dynamically.

Schoenheimer later made use of nitrogen-15 to label amino acid molecules and show that there was constant action there, too— molecules rapidly changing and shifting even though the overall movement might be small.

1934,Crystalline Viruses,"['Wendell Meredith Stanley', 'Stanley', 'Sumner']","['Sumner', 'Northrop', 'American']","The first enzyme had been crystallized by Sumner (see 1926), and other enzymes had been crystallized since by Northrop and others (see 1930), so that the mystery of the chemical nature of enzymes was removed. The American biochemist Wendell Meredith Stanley (1904—1971) thought similar techniques might clarify some of the mysteries of virus structure. He prepared a quantity of tobacco mosaic virus (the first virus to be recognized as such by Beijerinck—see 1898) by growing tobacco and infecting it. He then mashed up the infected

leaves and put the mash through the usual procedures used by chemists to extract proteins and crystallize them, since he felt that viruses were probably protein in nature.

In 1935 he obtained fine needlelike crystals, which he isolated and found to possess all the infective properties of the virus in high concentration.

This raised problems, since it had always been thought that crystals were a form of matter characteristic of nonliving atoms and molecules, and since viruses could multiply, they had been thought to be living. The answer, quickly arrived at, was that crystallization was not a dividing line between life and nonlife, and that viruses were so simple a life form that they could crystallize.

As a result of this work, Stanley was awarded a share of the Nobel Prize for chemistry in 1946, along with Sumner and Northrop.

1934,Strong Interaction,"['Heisenberg', 'Fermi', 'Hideki Yukawa', 'Fermi Yukawa', 'Yukawa']",['Japanese'],"Heisenberg had tried to explain why the nucleus remained intact despite the repulsion between protons by supposing the existence of exchange forces (see

1932, Proton-Neutron Nucleus). Fermi had made use of that concept in working out his theory of the weak interaction (see 1934).

The Japanese physicist Hideki Yukawa (1907— 1981) used the ideas of Heisenberg and Fermi to build up a theory that would explain the nucleus. There had to be a shortrange force like that of the weak interaction, one that could be felt only within the nucleus. This shortrange force would have to be much stronger than the weak interaction and indeed much stronger than the electromagnetic interaction in order to overcome proton repulsion. For that reason, it came to be called the strong interaction.

Yukawa worked out his mathematical treatment in 1935. He showed that in order for the nucleus to exist, protons and neutrons had to exchange a particle possessing mass. The shorter the range of the force, the more massive the particle. He calculated that the particle exchanged ought to be about two hundred times as massive as an electron, or one-ninth as massive as a proton. Such intermediate-sized particles were unknown at the time, but eventually they were discovered. Yukawa was then awarded the

Nobel Prize for physics, in 1949. He was the first Japanese to win a Nobel Prize.

Prontosil had a fairly complicated molecule, however, and there was a reasonable hope that some smaller fraction of that molecule might have the same desirable properties but be easier to synthesize and so more available in quantity.

In 1935 Domagk managed to break up the molecule of Prontosil into several fragments, one of which was sulfanilamide, a compound already well known to organic chemists. Sulfanilamide turned out to have very pronounced antibacterial properties.

This heralded the synthesis of a whole family of similar compounds, collectively called the sulfa drugs, which were used to combat infections of various kinds.

made up of carbon and nitrogen molecules. They came to be labeled vitamin B-1 (which cured beriberi), vitamin B-2, and so on. The whole was the B-vitamin complex.

These letter-number combinations turned out to be unsatisfactory, however, because some reported vitamins turned out to be false alarms and others were simply not given such combination names. The B vitamins therefore came to be known by chemical names. Thus vitamin B-1 came to be called thiamin, vitamin B-2 riboflavin, and so on.

Karrer, who had determined the structure of vitamin A (see 1930), synthesized riboflavin in 1935 and presented the final proof of its structure. For this work, he was awarded a share of the Nobel Prize for chemistry in 1937.

1934,Cortisone,"['Edward Calvin Kendall', 'Kendall']","['Takamine', 'Epinephrine', 'Latin', 'American']","The first hormone to be isolated was adrenaline. It had been obtained by Takamine (see 1898, Epinephrine) from the adrenal glands. The adrenals consist of two parts, however, which turned out to be two different glands. The inner part, or medulla (the Latin word for “core”), is what manufactures adrenaline.  The outside part, which wraps about the medulla, is the cortex (from a Latin word for ""'bark”). It too manufactures hormones.

The American biochemist Edward Calvin Kendall (1886—1972) isolated no fewer than twenty-eight different cortical hormones, or corticoids, of which four showed effects on laboratory animals. He named the corticoids by letter, and the four effective ones were Compound A, Compound B, Compound E, and Compound F.

Of these, Compound E, which Kendall isolated in 1935, proved the most useful. It came to be called cortisone and was widely used as an anti-inflammatory drug.

For his work on corticoids, Kendall was awarded a share of the Nobel Prize for medicine and physiology in 1950.

He therefore called it prostaglandin. Prostaglandin and related compounds referred to collectively as the prostaglandins have since been

found in other tissues and have proved to have a wide variety of physiologic effects on the body.

1934,Radar,"['Langevin', 'Robert Alexander WatsonWatt']","['Fizeau', 'Scottish']","To send out a beam of light and record the time it took to be reflected back across a given distance had first been used to determine the speed of light by Fizeau (see 1849). Once the speed of

light was determined with good accuracy, the time it took for a beam of light to strike an object and return could be made to yield both the direction and the distance of the reflecting object. Such a scheme, making use of ultrasonic sound, had been used by Langevin in devising sonar (see 1917).

The use of light for such a purpose is impracti-

cal, because light is too easily stopped by obstacles and too easily absorbed and scattered by mist, dust, and fog. Radio waves are much more penetrating, but those most commonly used in communication are so long that they bend around obstacles rather than being reflected. However, if the shortest radio waves (microwaves) are used, they are reflected by moderately sizable objects and are sufficiently penetrating to pass through cloud and fog.

The Scottish physicist Robert Alexander WatsonWatt (1892-1973) worked on devices for the emission of microwaves and for the detection of the reflected beam. By 1935 he could use his device to follow the path of an airplane by the microwave reflections it sent back.

The system was called radio detection and ranging, abbreviated to ra. d. a. r., or radar. This development was to prove of life-anddeath importance in just a few years.

1934,Imprinting,"['Konrad Lorenz', 'Lorenz']",['German'],"In 1935 the Austrian-born German zoologist Konrad Lorenz (1903—1989), a student of bird behavior, described imprinting. He showed that at a certain critical point in early life, soon after hatching, young birds learned to follow a moving object, usually their mother, who was sure to be in the neighborhood after all. If this for some reason was not the case, the hatchlings would follow some other adult bird or a human being or even a pulled inanimate object

Once imprinting had taken place, it affected their behavior to some extent all their lives.

Lorenz thus established the science of ethology, the study of animal behavior in natural environments, and initiated the study of how learned behavior in very early life affected later events. For his work on animal behavior, he was awarded a share in the Nobel Prize for physiology and medicine in 1973.

This scale measured the extent of Earth movement by a series of numbers, each one of which represented a movement ten times as great as the number before. The damage done rises even faster than the extent of movement. The strongest earthquakes so far recorded have reached 8.9 on the Richter scale.

In 1936 the Hungarianborn American physicist Eugene Paul Wigner (b. 1902) worked out the mathematics that governed the manner in which neutrons were absorbed by atomic nuclei. It showed how the likelihood of neutron absorption varied with the energy of the neutron. It also introduced the concept of nuclear cross section: the greater the cross section of a particular type of nucleus, the greater the likelihood of its absorbing a neutron.

For this and other work, Wigner was awarded a share of the Nobel Prize for physics in 1963.

The American chemist Robert Runnels Williams (1886—1965) brought this work to fruition. He had isolated about a third of an ounce of the vitamin from a ton of rice polishings, and this was enough to enable him to determine its molecular structure. In 1936 he synthesized thiamine—the final proof that his structure was correct.

It was then no longer necessary to work with huge quantities of rice polishings. Thiamine by the ton could be prepared in the laboratory.

organs or tissues alive by means of perfusion; that is, by passing blood or blood substitutes continuously through the tissues by way of its own blood vessels. He kept a piece of embryonic chicken heart alive and growing (it had to be periodically trimmed) for over thirty-four years—much longer than the normal life expectancy of a chicken— before the experiment was deliberately terminated.

In 1936, to make the process more efficient, Carrel put into use a perfusion pump that Lindbergh (see 1927) had helped him design. It drove the blood and was germ-proof. It was called an artificial heart, though it was not the kind of artificial heart that could substitute for the natural one in the human chest.

1937,Technetium,"['Noddack', 'Emilio Gino Segré', 'Fermi', 'Segré', 'Segre', 'Robert Oppenheimer', 'Segre Noddack']","['Ltalian', 'Urey', 'Deuterium', 'American', 'Greek']","By now, only four gaps remained in the periodic table of elements between number 1 (hydrogen) and number 92 (uranium). They were numbers 43, 61, 85, and 87. Noddack and his colleagues, who had discovered rhenium (see 1925),

thought they had also discovered number 43, but it turned out they were mistaken.

The Ltalian physicist Emilio Gino Segré (1905—1989) tackled the problem in a different way. Thinking the chances small that he could find the element in the Earth's crust, he won-

dered if he might not manufacture it. After all, Fermi had been bombarding elements with neutrons to produce elements higher by one atomic number (see 1934). If Segré bombarded molybdenum (element 42), might he not then manufacture detectable quantities of element 43?

In 1937 Segre bombarded molybdenum with deuterons, the atomic nuclei of hydrogen-2, which had been discovered by Urey (see 1931, Deuterium). A deuteron consists of one proton and one neutromn, rather loosely bound. If such a particle approached a nucleus, the positive charge of the nucleus would repel the positively charged proton, breaking it from the neutron and deflecting it away. The uncharged neutron, unaffected, would strike the nucleus.

It was an American physicist, Robert Oppenheimer (1904-1967), who had demonstrated that deuteron bombardment was equivalent to neutron bembardment. Why not use neutrons in the first place? Because the deuteron, carrying an electric charge, could be accelerated in a cyclotron and made very energetic. A neutron by itself could not.

Segre analyzed the bombarded molybdenum and did indeed isolate very small quantities of an element that, from its chemical properties, could be seen to be number 43. It was the first element to be indisputably formed in the laboratory, rather than discovered in nature, so it was

named technetium, from the Greek word for “artificial.”

As it turned out, no technetium isotope was stable; all were radioactive. It is, indeed, the simplest element to have no stable isotopes. The most nearly stable isotope, technetium97, has a half-life of 2,600,000 years. That is not a long enough half-life for it to have endured in the soil since the formation of the Earth. It is for that reason that it was never detected in the soil, and why Noddack had to be mistaken.

1937,Muon,"['Anderson', 'Earth', 'Yukawa', 'Strong', 'Anderson Yukawa']",['Greek'],"Anderson, who had discovered the positron as a result of studying cosmic ray bombardment of atoms within Earth'’s atmosphere (see 1932), was still investigating such bombardments. In the process, he discovered the track of a particle that, from its curvature in the magnetic field, appeared to be more massive than an electron but less massive than a proton.

By 1937 there was no doubt about it, for the same phenomenon had been observed by others as well. It seemed to be the type of particle that Yukawa had postulated (see 1935, Strong Interaction), when

trying to work out what held protons and neutrons together in the atomic nucleus.

The new particle was called a mesotron, from a Greek word for “intermediate,” and this was eventually shortened to meson. Once it was found that there were different varieties of these intermediate particles, different mesons had to be identified and differentiated in some way. Anderson’s meson was therefore called a mumeson, mu being a Greek letter equivalent to our m.

It turned out, however, that the mu-meson was not the particle Yukawa had postulated. It showed no tendency to interact with nuclei, and Yukawa's particles would have had to. Its name was therefore contracted further to muon, since it was not a meson in the sense that other intermediate-sized particles were.

1937,Electrophoresis,"['Arne Wilhelm Kaurin Tiselius', 'Failure', 'Tiselius']",['Swedish'],"Proteins carry electric charges here and there on their large molecules, some positive, some negative. If an electric field is imposed on a solution of proteins, those with a positive charge outweighing the negative charge will travel

toward the cathode, and those with a negative charge outweighing the positive charge will travel toward the anode. The rate at which a protein molecule will travel in either direction depends on how great the overall charge is and, to some extent, on the pattern of the charges over the molecular surface. Enough variation exists so that every protein molecule travels at a different speed. A technique that takes advantage of this to separate and isolate protein components of a mixture is called electrophoresis.

A Swedish biochemist, Arne Wilhelm Kaurin Tiselius (1902—-1971), developed the technique in 1937. He devised a special tube in the form of a rectangular U within which the proteins could move and separate. The Tiselius tube consisted of portions fitted together at specially ground joints, which could be separated to isolate one of a mixture of proteins in a particular chamber.

In addition, by the use of proper cylindrical lenses, it was possible to follow the process of separation by observing changes in the refraction of light passing through the suspension. These changes could be photographed, and the re-

sulting wavelike pattern could be used to calculate the quantity of each protein present in the mixture. Failure to separate a mixture into components by electrophoresis was good evidence of the purity of a protein preparation, particularly if there continued to be no separation when the acidity of the solution was changed.

For his work on electrophoresis, Tiselius was awarded the Nobel Prize for chemistry in 1948.

The Canadian physicist James Hillier (b. 1915) accomplished this feat. His microscope could magnify seven thousand times, whereas the best optical microscope could only manage a magnification of two thousand times.

Eventually, Hillier and others devised electron microscopes with still further capabilities, until magnifications of two million times became possible.

Field-Emission Microscope

A magnifying device even more impressive than the ¢lectron microscope, although of only limited use, is the field-emission microscope, first devised in 1937 by the German-born American physicist Erwin Wilhelm Mueller (1911-1977).

This involves a very fine needle tip in a high vacuum. The tip can be made to emit electrons that shoot outward in diverging straight lines and strike a fluorescent screen. What appears on the screen, then, is a vastly magnified picture of the needle tip.

Eventually, the image of single atoms could be made out.

In 1937, however, an American radio engineer, Grote Reber (b. 1911), built the first radio telescope in his back yard. It was a para

bolic reflector 31 feet in diameter, and the radio waves he received could be reflected to a focus so that their intensity could be measured.

In this way, Reber discovered points in the sky that emitted radio waves more strongly than did the general background, and he was the first to prepare a radio map of the sky. Naturally, Reber’s work was primitive compared to what was to come in succeeding decades, but for several years he was the only radio astronomer in the world.

Virus Nucleic Acid Stanley had succeeded in crystallizing tobacco mosaic virus and proving that it was protein in nature (see 1935). The question was whether the virus was entirely protein. Viruses are indisputably living, and if they consisted only of protein, it would follow that protein molecules (if sufficiently complex) were the essence of life. Everything else, even simpler proteins, would be merely auxiliary material.

In 1937, however, a British plant pathologist, Frederick Charles Bawden

(b. 1908), was able to show that tobacco mosaic virus contained, in addition to protein, a small quantity of ribonucleic acid (RNA). Eventually, viruses generally were found to contain cither RNA or DNA, which means they are nucleoprotein rather than merely protein.

The fact that chromosomes are also nucleoproteins (containing DNA) makes it seem that viruses are chromosomes “on the loose”"" and that it is nucleoprotein that is the essence

of life.

Szent-Gyorgyi (see 1928, Hexuronic Acid) had found that any of four different four-carbon acids, if added to tissue slices, stimulated oxygen uptake. He suspected that they must play some role in carbohydrate metabolism. Beginning in 1937, the German-born British biochemist Hans Adolf Krebs (1900-1981) found two sixcarbon acids, including the familiar citric acid, that

also played a role. He worked out the details of a cycle that began and ended with citric acid. Sugar molecules entered the cycle, and carbon dioxide molecules emerged at the other end, along with several pairs of hydrogen atoms that, through another chain of reactions including cytochromes (see 1924), were united with oxygen to yield the energy used by the body.

This citric acid cycle is often called the Krebs cycle in honor of its discoverer, and for this work, Krebs was awarded a share of the Nobel Prize for physiology and medicine in 1953.

1937,Niacin,"['Goldberger', 'Conrad Arnold Elvehjem', 'Harden', 'Animals', 'Elvehjem']",['American'],"Goldberger had shown that pellagra was a vitamin-deficiency disease (see 1915). A disease of dogs called blacktongue was the canine equivalent of pellagra.

In 1937 the American biochemist Conrad Arnold Elvehjem (1901-1962) considered the problem. EulerChelpin had shown that Harden'’s coenzyme included nicotinamide (see 1923). The enzyme wouldn’t work without the coenzyme, and the coenzyme wouldn’t work without the nicotinamide portion. Human beings,

dogs, and other animals can manufacture all parts of the coenzyme from simpler substances—except the nicotinamide. That has to be present in the diet. Since enzymes are needed in trace quantities only, so are coenzymes, and so, in this case, is nicotinamide, Animals can risk depending on the diet for something needed in so small a quantity. Plants can make nicotinamide out of simpler substances.

But suppose the diet lacks even the trace quantities of nicotinamide that are needed? In that case, the enzyme won'’t work, carbohydrate metabolism will proceed limpingly or not at all, and serious symptoms will arise.

Nicotinic acid is simpler than nicotinamide and is easily converted to nicotinamide in mammalian tissue. Elvehjem therefore added a very small quantity of nicotinic acid to the diet of a dog with blacktongue, and it improved markedly and very quickly. It was at once apparent that nicotinic acid and nicotinamide were the vitamins that prevented pellagra, or cured it if it occurred.

Because physicians didn't want the lay public to confuse nicotinic acid with nicotine (a poisonous

alkaloid) and assume there were vitamins in cigarettes, they used the names niacin and niacinamide for nicotinic acid and nicotinamide.

It turned out that other vitamins also worked because they were essential parts of coenzymes, parts that could not be manufactured in the body, were needed only in trace amounts, and could be picked up ready-made from the diet.

Soon after Darwin, Mendel had developed the laws of genetics (see 1865), and some decades later, De Vries had shown the existence of mutations (see 1900). It seemed possible that mutations provided the variations that allowed natural selection to function as a mechanism for producing evolutionary changes. The exact rationale of this was not quite understood, however.

In 1937 the Russianborn American geneticist Theodosius Dobzhansky (1900-1975), who worked with fruit flies after the fashion of Morgan (see 1927), published a book entitled Genetics and the Origin of Species in which mutation and evolution were neatly joined together. As a result, evolution was understood on a molecular level as well as on an organismic level.  1938

The result would be what was eventually called a television screen.

The first practical television camera was constructed in 1938 by the Russian-born American engineer Vladimir Kosma Zworykin (1889-1982). He called it an iconoscope. The rear of the iconoscope was coated with a large number of tiny cesium-silver droplets. Each emitted electrons as a light beam scanned it, in proportion to the brightness of the light.

This technique he called xerography (from Greek words meaning ""dry writing,” since no ink was used), and his first successtul attempt came on October 22, 1938.

It took years to secure a patent and interest a corporation in the process. Eventually, though, the process led to the modern technique of photocopying, which has virtually eliminated the mimeograph machine and greatly reduced the need for carbon paper.

1937,Ballpoint Pen,"['Ladislao Biro', 'Georg Biro']",['Hungarian'],"In 1938 two Hungarian brothers, Ladislao Biro and Georg Biro, designed a ballpoint pen: ink from an internal reservoir coated a tiny ball at the end of the pen, and the ball rolled, depositing ink on the paper. When the design was sufficiently improved and a high-viscosity ink was de veloped that would not blot, streak, or stain the fingers and that dried almost at once, the ballpoint pen took over. Fountain pens and inkwells became almost obsolete, and even pencils and erasers became less prominent.

1939,Coelacanth,['J. L.'],"['South Africa', 'South African']","Finding a new kind of fossil is exciting enough, but finding a living specimen of a species thought to exist

only as a fossil is far more exciting.

On December 25, 1938, a trawler fishing off South Africa brought up an odd fish about 5 feet long. The oddest thing about it was that its fins were attached to fleshy lobes rather than directly to the body.

A South African zoologist, J. L. B. Smith, who had the chance of examining it, recognized it as a coelacanth, a primitive fish that zoologists thought had

been extinct for seventy million years—to have vanished from the Earth while dinosaurs still existed.

Eventually, other specimens of the fish were obtained as well. What is most interesting about this (from our own viewpoint) is that the coelacanth is a close relative of the kind of fish that, hundreds of millions of years ago, clambered onto land, became amphibious, and thus became our ancestors.

ment number 93, but the re-

sults had been confusing (see 1934).

Hahn and Meitner, who had discovered protactinium (see 1917), were investigating the matter. Among other things, they dissolved the bombarded uranium and added a barium compound. When they precipitated the barium,

they found that a fraction of the radioactivity came down with it.

This was what they had hoped for. Barium is chemically very like radium, so that anything that precipitated barium would also precipitate radium. In fact, the bombardment of uranium (element number 92) with neutrons mig somehow 1 sion by uranium of fivo

puzzling than ever

In 1938 Meitner, an Austrian national, had to flee the country because, with its annexation by Germany, it became subject to Germany's anti-Semitic laws. She escaped to Sweden.

Hahn, now working with the German chemist Fritz Strassman (1902— 1980), finally began to suspect that the radioactivity could not be separated from the barium because it consisted of a radioactive isotope of that very element. But how could a radioactive isotope of barium have been formed in the neutron bombardment of uranium? The atomic number of barium is 56. For uranium to form barium, the uranium nucleus would have to break in two (something that later came to be called nuclear fission).

Nuclear fission was unheard of, and Hahn hesitated to make such a suggestion. He published his findings in January 1939 but said nothing about fission.

Meitner, in Sweden, thinking about the matter, also came to the conclusion that uranium had undergone nuclear fission and had produced a radioactive isotope of barium, but she decided to advance the possibility publicly. With the help of her nephew, the

physicist Otto Robert Frisch (1904-1979), she prepared a paper dated January 26, 1939, and sent it to the British scientific journal Nature.

Frisch was working for Bohr (see 1913) and told him of the contents of the paper before it was published. Bohr was going to the United States to attend a physics conference in Washington, D.C., on January 26, 1939, and he spread the word there, also before the paper was published.

In the United States, nuclear fission as a result of the neutron bombardment of uranium was quickly confirmed. Bohr had suggested that it was the rare isotope, uranium-235, that underwent fission, and that was confirmed, too.

For his discovery of nuclear fission, Hahn was awarded the Nobel Prize for chemistry in 1944, but it was not until 1946 that he could accept it.

1939,Nuclear Chain Reaction,"['Leo Szilard', 'Szilard', 'Szilard Szilard']","['Chain', 'Hungarianborn', 'German', 'Germany', 'Great Britain', 'American']","Chain reactions are familiar in chemistry. A reaction may produce heat, which encourages further reaction, which produces more heat, and so on. The manner in which a lightning stroke, or a single match, can burn

down an entire forest is an example of a chemical chain reaction. A chemical reaction can also produce a molecular product, which brings about more of the chemical reaction, which produces more of the molecular product, and so on. The formation of polymers is sometimes the result of such a chain reaction.

As early as 1932, it had occurred to the Hungarianborn physicist Leo Szilard (1898—1964) that a nuclear chain reaction was also possible. By that time, atomic nuclei were being bombarded by neutrons, and in some cases, the entry of one neutron into a nucleus meant the ejection of two neutrons. Szilard envisaged the case of a neutron disrupting a nucleus and producing two neutrons, which would disrupt two nuclei, producing four neutrons, which would disrupt four nuclei, and so on. Each disruption would deliver a tiny quantity of energy, but each link in such a nuclear chain reaction would proceed so quickly that the energy produced would mount in a fraction of a second to titanic proportions. The result would be a nuclear bomb, tremendously more powerful than ordinary bombs based on chemical chain reactions.

Szilard was one of

many scientists fleeing Central Europe because of German anti-Semitism, and the brains that Germany thus rejected and the allies absorbed were eventually to prove of inestimable help to the allies. Szilard patented the notion of a nuclear chain reaction and offered it to Great Britain.

The nuclear reactions known in 1932 and for several years afterward were not suitable for nuclear chain reactions, however. It took a fast, energetic neutron to eject two neutrons, but those two ejected neutrons were too slow, too lacking in energy, to continue the chain.

In 1939, however, when Szilard heard of nuclear fission, which was brought about by slow neutrons, he realized that a nuclear chain reaction and a nuclear bomb were finally possible, and he promptly began a campaign to persuade American scientists to keep their researches into such things secret. To a large extent, he succeeded.

1939,Francium,['Marguerite Perey'],['French'],"Only three elements remained undiscovered: numbers 61, 85, and 87. In 1939 the French physicist Marguerite Perey (1909-1975), working with the radioac-

tive element actinium, discovered a type of beta activity that was not quite like that of any known isotope. She tracked it down and found that it resulted from the breakdown of an isotope of element number 87. She named it francium, for her native country.

As it turned out, the most nearly stable isotope of the element is francium223, which has a half-life of only 22 minutes. Of all the elements between 1 and 92, francium is the only one that possesses no isotope with a half-life of as much as half an hour.

1939,Neutron Stars,['Zwicky'],[],"Zwicky had suggested the possible existence of a neutron star (see 1934).

Nevertheless, the matter remained strictly theoretical, for no such object had actually been observed, or would be for another thirty years.

P

studies of molecular beams undertaken by Stern (see 1933) and by Rabi (see 1938).

The Swiss-born American physicist Felix Bloch (1905-1983) worked out methods for determining the magnetic properties of molecules within liquids and solids. From this work, he calculated the magnetic moment of the neutron. This was important, because the neutron is not an electrically charged particle and should therefore have no magnetic field. Yet Bloch demonstrated that it had.

This was the first indication that the neutron might be a composite particle, made up of more fundamental particles that did have electrical charges.

The fact that the neutron had a magnetic moment, incidentally, showed that such a thing as an antineutron could exist, which would have a magnetic field pointed in the direction opposite to that of the neutron.

The magnetic moment of the neutron was independently worked out at about the same time in another way by the American physicist Edward Mills Purcell (b. 1912). As a result, Bloch and Purcell shared the Naobel Prize for physics in 1952.

Vitamin K

A Danish biochemist, Car] Peter Henrik Dam (1895— 1976), fed hens a synthetic diet and noticed that on some diets they developed small hemorrhages under the skin and within the muscles. Vitamin C, which cures some conditions like that, didn't help.

He finally decided that the problem stemmed from lack of some fat-soluble vitamin not yet known, the presence of which was necessary for proper coagulation of the blood. He named it vitamin K (for koagulation, the German spelling of the word).

This was done in 1934, but it was not till 1939 that the American biochemist Edward Adelbert Doisy (1893-1986) worked out the structure of the vitamin and synthesized it. For this work, Dam and Doisy shared the Nobel Prize for medicine and physiology in 1943.

A Russian-born Ameri-

can immunologist, Philip Levine (b. 1900), was studying erythroblastosis fetalis, a disease of fetuses and newborn infants that was marked by severe destruction of the red blood cells. (They were therefore called blue babies.)

Levine noted, in 1939, that the mothers in these

cases lacked a blood compo-

nent called the Rk factor (because it had first been recognized in the blood of rhesus monkeys used as experimental animals). The mothers were Rli-negative, but the fathers were RApositive, which was genetically dominant, so that their offspring were Rhpositive also. However, the fetus’s blood apparently brought about the production of antibodies to the Rh-positive factor in the mother’s blood. These antibodies filtered into the fetus’s blood and destroyed the red corpuscles. Routine testing for Rh factor prepared physicians for this possibility, and the replacement of the infant’s blood supply by new blood reduced the death rate.

Penicillin Fleming had discovered penicillin (see 1928), but

nothing much came of it until 1939. Then an

Australian-born British pathologist, Howard Walter Florey (1898-1968), in collaboration with a Germanborn British pathologist, Ernst Boris Chain (1906— 1979), set about isolating the actual antibacterial agent from the mold.

They reached their goal quickly and the groundwork was laid for penicillin’s use during the dark days of war that were to follow. As a result, Florey, Chain, and Fleming were awarded the Nobel Prize for medicine and physiology in 1945.

1939,Tyrothricin,"['René Jules Dubos', 'Tyrothricin']","['American', 'Bacillus']","Most pathogenic bacteria do not survive well in the soil, which is why burying people who have died of disease does not necessarily keep epidemics going. It is possible to reason that this may be because antibacterial substances are produced by bacteria that do commonly live in the soil and are not pathogenic. (One might suppose that there is an evolutionary benefit for these bacteria in preventing the invasion of other species of bacteria.) The French-born American microbiologist René Jules Dubos (1901-1982) investigated the matter and, in 1939, isolated an antibacterial substance from a bac-

terium called Bacillus brevis. He named it tvrothricin. This was found to be a mixture of several polypeptides (amino acid chains rather smaller than those found in proteins generally).

Tyrothricin was not a very effective antibacterial agent, but it and penicillin ushered in an era characterized by the most powerful weapons against infection the medical profession had yet possessed.

1939,Essential Minerals,"['Paul Hermann Miiller', 'Miller']","['Paris', 'Swiss']","In 1939 Keilin, who had demonstrated the existence of the cytochromes (see 1924), showed that the enzyme carbonic anhydrase contained a small quantity of zinc that was essential to its working. This meant that since the enzyme was essential to life, so was zinc.

A number of elements, usually associated with minerals rather than with life, have since been shown to be essential to life in trace quantities because of their association with enzymes. Included are manganese, molybdenum, and copper. These may be grouped together as essential minerals, or essential trace elements.

DDT

The most serious enemies of humanity, next to pathogenic microorganisms, are the insects. Not only do they carry and spread diseases such as yellow fever, malaria, typhus, and encephalitis, but they also eat crops and make serious inroads into the human food supply. Through the ages, they have been feared and fought, and as knowledge of chemistry grew, poisons had been used to kill them. Unfortunately, the inorganic poisons used, such as Paris green, were deadly to mammals, including human beings.

The Swiss chemist Paul Hermann Miiller (1899— 1965) began a search for organic substances that might be poisonous to insects but not to other forms of life, and that would also be cheap, stable, and without unpleasant odor.

In September 1939 he tried dichlorodiphenyltrichloroethane (of which the common abbreviation is DDT), a compound known to chemists since 1873, and it seemed to fulfill all the requirements. DDT proved exceedingly valuable in the years to come, particularly in fighting lice-spread typhus, so that Miller was awarded the Nobel Prize for medi-

ALY

cine and physiology in 1948.

In time, to be sure, DDT turned out to have its harmful aspects after all, and its use dwindled. Nevertheless, it was the forerunner of a great variety of pesticides that have served humanity.

1939,Helicopter,"['Ivan Sikorsky', 'Sikorsky']","['Greek', 'American', 'Vietnam', 'Afghanistan']","One problem with airplanes is that they must move quickly in order to produce aerodynamic lift under their wings. If they slow up, the lift dwindles and they crash, A device that exerted a force straight upward instead of merely forward as propellers do would eliminate this necessity for speed-born lift.

The obvious solution was a large propeller directly overhead. Since the ends of the propeller would mark out a helix as the vehicle lifted upward, such a device was called a helicopter, from Greek words meaning “helical wing.”

The Russian-born American aeronautical engineer [gor Ivan Sikorsky (1889-1972) had been working with helicopters for thirty years and finally in 1939 produced a satisfactory model. On September 14, a helicopter with Sikorsky himself at the controls flew successfully. The time  was to come when it would

be a primary weapon in wars fought in Vietnam and Afghanistan, to say nothing of its uses in tracking traffic, rescue work, and intra-urban transportation.

1940,Frequency Modulation,"['Radio', 'Marconi']",['Armstrong'],"Static in radio broadcasts was proving a rather intractable problem. Radio transmission for the first forty

years after Marconi’s discovery (see 1901) was carried out by systematically altering the amplitude (the height of the wave) of the carrier signal to match the variation in the amplitude of the sound waves being transmitted. This was called amplitude modulation, or AM.

Unfortunately, thunderstorms and electrical appliances also modulate the amplitude, doing it randomly and producing the irritating noise of static.

In 1939, however, Armstrong, who had invented the superheterodyne receiver (see 1916), devised a method of transmitting a signal by systematically altering the frequency (the length of the wave) of the carrier signal. This was called frequency modulation, or FM. Thunderstorms and electrical appliances have no effect on frequency, so FM transmission is largely static-free. Unfortunately, FM will work only for carrier waves of high frequency, and these cannot be transmitted much beyond the horizon.

Hahn and Meitner had shown that the result was nuclear fission (see 1939). The two were not mutually exclusive, however. It was possible that some uranium nuclei might undergo fis-

sion and others might undergo the kind of changes that would produce element number 93.

In 1940 the American physicists Edwin Mattison McMillan (b. 1907) and Philip Hauge Abelson (b. 1913), studying uranium that had been bombarded with neutrons, detected a beta particle with a halllife of 2.3 days. When they

had tracked this down, they

announced on June 8, 1940,

that they had located traces of element number 93. Since uranium had been named for the planet Uranus (see 1789), the new element, lying bevond uranium, was named neptuniwm, for Neptune, the planet lying beyond Uranus. Since the neptunium isotope that had been located emitted beta particles, it had to gain another unit in atomic number and produce element number  MESE

94, which was named pluionium, for the planet Pluto. In this part of the work, the American physicist Glenn Theodore Seaborg (b. 1912) was prominent.

Neptunium and plutonium were the first of the transuranium elements to be discovered. There would be others.

Seaborg recognized that the transuranium elements were part of a series analogous to the rare earth elements. There were fifteen elements running from lanthanum (number 57) to lutetium (number 71) inclusive (with number 61 still undiscovered), and they were now called the lanthanides after the first member. The second group would be the fifteen elements running from actinium (number 89) to element number 103 inclusive, and they were named the actinides. Six of the actinides were now known, and nine remained to be discovered.

For their work on transuranium elements, McMillan and Seaborg were awarded the Nobel Prize for chemistry in 1951.

"
1940,Uranium Hexafluoride,"['Abelson', 'Uranium']",[],"One of the problems in preparing a nuclear bomb was that only uranium-235

would participate in a slow-neutron nuclear chain reaction, but uranium-238 was present to the extent of 140 atoms for every atom of uranium-235. The uranium238 atoms would absorb neutrons and undergo reactions other than fission, which dampened and even aborted the chain reaction.

It would be necessary to prepare enriched uranium, with a larger percentage of the uranium-235 atoms. Separating two isotopes is difficult, however. If uranium were a gas, which could be made to pass through long narrow passages, or very fine holes, the uranium-235, being lighter by 1.26 percent, would move a little faster, so that the first sample to arrive at the other end would be slightly richer in uranium-235 than the natural element would be. If this was done over and over (gaseous diffusion), satisfactorily enriched uranium would result. But uranium is not a gas.

In 1940 Abelson, who was helping to isolate neptunium (see above), suggested that uranium hexafluoride, with each molecule made up of one uranium atom and six fluorine atoms, was a liquid that was easily evaporated, and the vapors might then be made to pass through tubes or holes.

Uranium hexafluoride containing a uranium-235 atom had a molecular weight of 349 compared to 352 for uranium hexafluoride with a uranium-238 atom. The difference in weight is nearly 1 percent, and that was enough. Gaseous diffusion sufficed to produce enriched uranium.

1940,Astatine,[],['Greek'],"In 1940 Segre, who had isolated technetium (see 1937), bombarded bismuth (element number 83) with alpha particles. If an alpha particle struck the bismuth and remained, or even if a neutron were emitted thereafter, the bismuth would have gained two protons and the result would be the undiscovered element number 85. This was accomplished in 1940, but World War II interrupted, and it wasn't until the war was over that they could confirm their finding.

The new element was quite unstable. Its most long-lived isotope had a hall-life of only 8.3 hours. It was therefore named astatine, from the Greek word for “unstable.” It belonged ta the same group as fluorine, chlorine, bromine, and iodine, which is why it received the -ine ending.

With the discovery of astatine, only one gap remained in the entire peri

odic table from element number 1 (hydrogen) to element number 94 (plutonium), and that was element number 61.

1940,Betatron,['Donald William Kerst'],['American'],"Cyclotrons were used to accelerate protons, which are massive particles and energetic enough to get results even when they are not moving at very high speeds (see 1930).

It might be useful to accelerate electrons, but they are so light that to obtain useful energies they would have to be brought to speeds quite close to that of light. That would introduce a mass increase according to special relativity (see 1905) and cause the accelerating pulse to go out of synchronization, setting a toolow limit on the speeds achieved.

In 1940, however, the American physicist Donald William Kerst (b. 1911) devised an accelerator that whirled the electrons in cir-

cles rather than spirals. This new device, called the betatron (because it accelerated beta particles), made useful electron bombardment possible.

Streptomycin was quite effective against bac-

Fritz Albert Lipmann (1899-1986) showed that there were two kinds of phosphate bonds. In one kind, the loss of the phosphate bond liberated a relatively small quantity of energy; in the other, the loss liberated a relatively large quantity. The latter esters possessed a high-energy phosphate.

In the course of carbohydrate metabolism, phosphate groups are added to sugar molecules forming a low-energy phosphate. The sugar molecule then undergoes the kind of change that concentrates the energy in the phosphate group, so that a high-energy phosphate is formed. These high-energy phosphate groups then serve as the “small change"" of energy. In the simplest terms, food and oxygen combine to form high-energy phosphate bonds, which then deal out energy for all the energyconsuming functions of the body.

The most versatile of the high-energy configurations is a compound called adenosine triphosphate (ATP), each molecule of which contains two highenergy phosphates and which has been found to be concerned with body chemistry at almost every point where energy is required.

Measurement of the parallax had improved with time, but it was always difficult to deal with Mars in this respect, since it showed a small orb in the telescope, which forced a certain ambiguity on the measurement of its exact position.

Nearly a century before, the German astronomer Johann Gottfried Galle (1812—1910) had suggested that the parallax of an asteroid be used for determining the scale of the Solar System and the distance of the Sun, since its size and starlike appearance would make its positioning more accurate. However, asteroids were farther off than Mars and their parallax was correspondingly smaller and harder 1o measure.

But then Eros had been  discovered by Witt (see 1898), and Eros could on occasion approach more closely than any planet.

In 1931 Eros approached within 16,000,000 miles of Earth, and a long, detailed program was set up in advance. Fourteen observatories in nine countries took part under the leadership of the English astronomer Harold Spencer Jones (1890-1960). Seven months were spent on the project, nearly three thousand photographs were taken, and the position of Eros was determined on each.

Ten years of calculation followed, and by 1941 Jones was able to announce that the distance of the Sun was 93,005,000 miles, That was the most accurate determination yet and was probably the best that could be done until methods transcending the aceuracy of parallax determination were devised.

The advantage jet planes had over rockets such as those developed by Goddard (see 1926) was that they traveled through the atmosphere, so they needed to carry only fuel and could make use of the oxygen in the surrounding air as the oxidizer.

Plans for engines that made some use of the jet principle can be traced back to 1921, but the first patent for a jet engine of the type used today was obtained by a British aeronautical engineer, Frank Whittle (b. 1907), in 1930.

Neutrons colliding with the carbon atoms in graphite did not affect the carbon nuclei but bounced off, giving up their energy and moving more slowly as a result, thus increasing their chance of reacting with uranium-235. Making the pile as large as possible made it more likely that neutrons would strike uranium-235 before blundering out of the pile altogether and into the open air. The necessary size was the critical mass. Naturally, the more enriched in uranium-235 the pile was, the smaller the critical mass needed to be.

Cadmium rods were inserted into the pile, because cadmium would soak up neutrons and keep the pile from becoming active prematurely. When the pile was large enough, the cadmium rods were slowly withdrawn and the number of neutrons produced slowly increased. At some point, the increase would reach the level where more were being produced than were being harmlessly consumed by the cadmium. At that time the nuclear chain reaction would begin and the whole thing would go out of control in a moment

What stopped that from happening was that some neutrons didn't come out of the bombarded nuclei at once. In other words, after the pile went critical, there was a slight pause before the delayed neutrons were emitted and everything went awry. During that pause, the cadmium rods could be shoved in again.

At 3:45 p.m. on December 2, 1942, in the squash

court of the University of Chicago, the chain reaction became self-sustaining and was choked off. The atomic age had begun. The atomic pile was the first nuclear reactor.

1942,Biotin,[],"['American', 'Vigneaud']","At this time a new vitamin could only be detected by noting that certain foods or food extracts could correct symptoms that known vitamins would not touch. One such new vitamin was called vitamin H. The American biochemist Vincent du Vigneaud (1901-1978) isolated tiny quantities of vitamin H in reasonably pure form, as judged by its powerful effect on the symptoms it could alleviate, and by 1942 had worked out its rather complicated tworing structure. The compound was now called biotin. It was synthesized and its structure proven.

In 1942 the Italianborn American microbiologist Salvador Edward Luria (b. 1912) managed to get good photographs of bacteriophages. These were unusually large viruses, to be sure, but they were considerably smaller than bacterial cells. Luria showed that the bacteriophage con-

sisted of a rounded head and a thin tail, rather like an extremely small sperm cell. This was the first time a virus had been seen as anything more than a vague dot.

1943,Adrenocorticotrophic Hormone,['Choh Hao Li'],"['American', 'Cortisone']","It was becoming more obvious that the pituitary gland was a particularly important source of protein hormones, some of which activated and controlled other glands, such as the thyroid and the gonads.

In 1943, the Chineseborn American biochemist Choh Hao Li (b. 1913) isolated, from the pituitary, a hormone that stimulated the adrenal cortex, using it to produce and release the cortical hormones (see 1935, Cortisone), This pituitary hormone was named adrenocorticotrophic hormone, a name usually abbreviated ACTH. It had the same effect on the body as cortisone, though more indirectly.

human body. Hoffman modified it to form the diethyl amide of the compound and apparently absorbed some of the substance. He was overcome by strange sensations, vivid fantasies, and brilliant colors. He deliberately swallowed a tiny bit more of the material—and the results were even more weird.

He had clearly suffered from hallucinations, so that lysergic acid diethylamide (usually abbreviated LSD) came to be called a hallucinogen, or a psychedelic drug. Other hallucinogens occur in nature, in certain mushrooms, in peyote cactus, and elsewhere. Even alcohol in sufficient quantities becomes hallucinogenic. Hallucinogens have been widely used in religious ceremonies, presumably because they seem to offer a vision of another world.

LSD was a particularly effective hallucinogen, and in time its use became a fad among young people, which helped fasten the drug culture on America.

In 1943, however, the American astronomer Carl K. Seyfert (1911-1960) detected an odd galaxy with a very bright spot at the center. Other galaxies of the sort have since been observed, and the entire group is known as Seyfert galaxies. Altogether perhaps 1 percent of all galaxies are Seyfert galaxies.

This was the first case of what came to be called active galaxies, those with centers that seem to be the site of activity beyond the normal. Much more remained to be discovered about such galaxies when it became possible to observe them outside the range of visible light.

1944,Aqualungs,[],"['French', 'Germans']","Until now, if you wanted to spend a reasonable period of time under water with sufficient mobility to allow exploration, you needed a diving-suit, which was heavy and required a lifeline.

behaved as adjuncts, like the heme in hemoglobin or the coenzymes in enzymes —though what the function of the nucleic

ic1d adjunct

might be was not known.

Then biochemists

began discovering that nucleic acids were not small molecules after all. Methods of isolating DNA had been so harsh that the molecules were recovered in small fragments. Gentler isolation retrieved larger molecules. It was also noticed that in sperm cells, where chromosomes were condensed to minimum size, the protein portion seemed unusually simple while the DNA seemed present in the usual quantity and complexity. Nevertheless, faith in proteins remained unshaken.

At this time, a Canadian-born American bacteriologist, Oswald Theodore Avery (1877-1955), was working with pneumococci —bacteria that caused pneumonia. Two different strains were grown in the laboratory—one with a smooth coat made up of a complicated carbohydrate molecule and one with a rough surface. The strains were called S (for smooth) and R (for rough).

Clearly the R strain lacked a gene for the formation of the carbohydrate surface. It was possible to prepare an extract from the S strain that contained no cells and was clearly nonliving, which on addition to the R strain would convert it into an S strain. The extract must contain the gene

(or transforming principle) that catalyzed the production of the carbohydrate. But what was the chemical nature of the transforming principle?

In 1944 Avery and his associates purified the transforming principle as far as they could while still leaving it functional and showed that it was DNA in nature and nothing else. There was no protein present. This was the first indication that the genetic material in cells was DNA and not protein. The discovery revolutionized genetics, which now began a quick advance.

Avery's discovery was clearly worthy of a Nobel Prize, but he died too soon to receive one.

In 1944 two British biochemists, Archer John Porter Martin (b. 1910) and Richard Laurence Millington Synge (b. 1914), invented paper chromatography. Instead of dripping the mixture

through a column of absorbent powder, this technique allowed it to creep up a column of absorbent filter paper. The paper could then be turned at right angles and dipped into another solvent, so that if the first did not separate the mixture entirely, the second, working on an already partially separated mixture, would complete the job.

Paper chromatography was faster than ordinary chromatography and worked on mere drops of solution. It was an excellent technique for separating the complex mixtures that were formed when a protein molecule was broken into fragments. For this work, Martin and Synge were awarded the Nobel Prize for chemistry in 1952.

These were molecules in which all the free valences of a carbon chain or ring were occupied by fluorine atoms.

It was possible to develop long chains of carbon atoms with fluorine atoms

attached, which would form polymers something like polyethylene (in which all the carbon valences were attached to hydrogen atoms). Fluorine atoms held much more tightly to the carbon chain than hydrogen atoms did, however. For that reason, long-chain polytetra-fluoroethylene (or Teflon for short) resisted change. It didn’t burn, dissolve, or stick to anything.

In 1944 Teflon was first produced for commercial use as a lining for frying pans. Since material would not stick to it, oil did not need to be used, and the frying pans were easily cleaned after use. Nor was the material in any way toxic.

. Synthesis of Quinine By now the techniques and methods of organic synthesis were so advanced that any organic molecule, no matter how complex, could be synthesized.

Perkin had attempted to synthesize quinine (see 1856) but was bound to fail, since its molecule was too complex for the methods then available.

In 1944, however, the American chemists Robert Burns Woodward (1917 1979) and William von Eg-

gers Doering (b. 1917) began with simple compounds that could be easily synthesized from their constituent elements, and from these they synthesized quinine.

Woodward went on to synthesize other complicated molecules and was eventually awarded the Nobel Prize for chemistry in 1965.

2,4-D

The chemical 2,4-dichlorophenoxyacetic acid (2,4-D for short) was introduced in 1944 and was the first effective chemical herbicide (Latin for “plant killer”). Naturally, killing plant life indiscriminately is not something one would want to do, but 2,4-D is selective in its effects. It does not seriously affect grasses (including the various grains so important to humanity) but prevents the growth of broad-leaved plants, usually regarded as weeds.

1944,New Nebular Hypothesis,"['Laplace', 'Chamberlin', 'Hannes Olof Gosta Alfvén', 'Radio', 'Hendrik Christoffel', 'Jansky', 'Reber', 'Van', 'Hulst']","['Eddington', 'Swedish', 'Hydrogen', 'Europe', 'Dutch', 'Hulst']","For nearly two centuries, astronomers had been trying to work out some reasonable mechanism that would account for the formation of the Solar System. Laplace’s nebular

hypothesis (see 1796) had broken down over the fact that 98 percent of the angular momentum of the Solar System was concentrated in the planets, which made up only 0.1 percent of the total mass of the system.

Chamberlin had advanced the planetesimal theory (see 1905), which required a near collision that would draw out solar matter by gravitational pull and form the planets. Eddington (see 1919), however, showed the interior of stars to be so incredibly hot that matter pulled out of the Sun would simply disperse and not collect into planets.

In 1944 Weizsacker (see 1938) worked out a new version of the nebular hypothesis. He introduced the notion of turbulence in the outer layers of the condensing nebula and showed how, as a result of such turbulence, planets would form in their actual observed orbits, more or less.

Furthermore, the development of magnetohydrodynamics at just about this time, by the Swedish astronomer Hannes Olof Gosta Alfvén (b. 1908), showed how thin gases moved when immersed in magnetic fields and how they could carry energy and angular momentum outward. This solved the

problem of the concentration of angular momentum in the planets.

The Weizsacker mechanism, with minor modifications, is now viewed as a likely explanation of the formation of the Solar System.

Radio Waves from Hydrogen

In German-occupied Europe, scientific work could proceed only with extreme difficulty. The Dutch astronomer Hendrik Christoffel van de Hulst (b. 1918) was forced to do what work he could with theoretical notions that required no more in the way of instrumentation than pen and paper.

He considered the behavior of cold hydrogen atoms and worked out how the magnetic fields associated with the proton and the electron in the hydrogen atom were oriented to each other. They could line up in the same direction or in opposite directions. Every once in a while a particular atom could flip from one configuration to another, and in so doing, it would emit a radio wave 21 centimeters in length.

Any single hydrogen atom ought to do this only

once in eleven million years or so on the average, but there were so many such atoms in space that a continuing drizzle of 21-centimeter radiation should be emitted, a drizzle that might be intense enough to be detectable.

Jansky's discovery had shown that radio waves were emitted by objects in the sky (see 1932), but bevond Reber's simple radio telescope (see 1937) there was nothing with which to observe such radio waves in any detail. Van de Hulst's calculations had to wait for corroboration.

Seaborg devoted himself to the task of preparing such elements by bombarding the massive atoms already known with subatomic particles.

In 1944, by bombarding plutonium with neutrons and alpha particles, Seaborg and his associates prepared americium, with an atomic number of 95, and curivm, with an atomic number of 96. The former

was named for America and the latter for the Curies (see 1897).

V-2

Since Goddard flew the first liquid-fueled rocket (see 1926), his work had been taken most seriously in Germany, where a group of 870 enthusiasts, including Wernher von Braun (see 1942), had begun experimenting with rockets in 1930.

Hitler favored such work for military use, and in 1936 von Braun headed a research project for the purpose of developing military rockets. In 1942 the first true missile, carrying its own fuel and oxygen, was shot off and reached a height of 60 miles.

On September 7, 1944, such missiles, called V-2s, with the V standing for vergeltung (vengeance), were first fired at London. (The V-1 had been a pilotless airplane wired with explosives, not nearly as damaging as the V-2.)

In all, 4,300 V-2s were fired; 1,230 hit London. Casualties included 2,511 dead and 5,869 seriously wounded. These missiles were armed with only chemical explosives, however, and came too late in the war to save Germany.  1945

1944,Nuclear Fission Bomb,[],"['Alamogordo', 'New Mexico']","For a nuclear chain reaction to take place (see 1939), it is necessary to accumulate enough fissile material (uranium-235 or an appropriate plutonium isotope manufactured from uranium-238) to bring about an explosion. The amount of fissile material has to be large enough (the critical mass) for enough of the neutrons produced to strike other nuclei before wandering out into open air.

If two pieces of fissile

material, each below the critical mass and therefore nonexploding, are fired into each other to form a single piece above the critical mass, any stray neutron (and there are always some around) will start the chain reaction and the material will explode in a fraction of a second.

By mid-1945 enough fissile material had been collected to carry through a test. On July 16, 1945, at a site 60 miles northwest of the town of Alamogordo, New Mexico, a nuclear fission bomb (popularly called an atomic bomb, or

1 A-bomb) made of pluto-

They could gain no further energy.

In 1945 McMillan (see 1940) worked out a method for synchronizing the magnetic field in such a way that the alternations of the magnetic field slowed and kept time with the mass increase of the particles. With such a synchrocyclotron, particle energies far in excess of 20 MeV could be reached, and it became possible to look to the day when particle accelerators might produce particles with energies in the range of cosmic ray particles.

The synchrocyclotron was independently devised at about the same time by the Soviet physicist Vladimir Iosifovich Veksler (1907—1966).

The Late 20th Century (1946—1993)

In the period after World War II, new knowledge and new technology empowered individuals in ways that could have been the stuff of science fiction only decades earlier. The Space Age began in 1957 with the launch by the Soviet Union of the satellite Sputnik I. When the Soviets sent up the Moon probe Lunik I in 1959, for the first time in history a human-made object rested on the surface of another world. U.S. astronaut Neil Alden Armstrong was the first human being to set foot on any werld other than Earth when in 1969 he stepped onto the surface of the Moon. The first human-made object was placed in orbit around another planet in 1971 when Mariner 9 arrived at Mars during a dust storm. The same year the Soviet Union placed in orbit the prototype of a space station. Even as space opened to scientists, so did our planet and the makeup of the human body. In 1953 two American physicists described the crust of Earth as divided into tightly joined plates—six large ones and numerous smaller ones—along the boundaries of which earthquake activ-

ity and volcanoes are concentrated. The study of plate tectonics revolutionized geology. Some of the most dramatic scientific advances in the late twentieth century have been in genetics. In 1944 Oswald Theodore Avery had shown that deoxyribonucleic acid (DNA)—not protein—made up the genes of the chromosomes. Then in 1953 Francis Crick and James Dewey Watson, using data and X-ray photographs from earlier studies, suggested that DNA was arranged as a double helix and that it underwent replication without changing its structure except for occasional mutations. Further steps toward working out the genetic code took place over the next decade, and other techniques led to the beginning of genetic engineering. Many of the medical therapies that we now take for granted were developed since 1945. Organ transplants, artificial organs, and other supports and surgical therapies for organs were developed starting in the mid-1950s. The first successful kidney transplant took place in 1954, and coronary medicine began to make dramatic advances in

1953, as the first workable heart-lung machine made it possible to perform openheart surgery without endangering the patient’s life. Perhaps nothing altered the way Americans worked and communicated during this period as much as the computer, which began to be mass-produced and used in industry during the early 1950s. The most important technological advance of the century was almost certainly the transistor, a small, rugged device that transmitted current more efficiently than radio tubes. By 1975 microchip circuitry had become so small that personal computers began to be used not only by science and business but by the general public as well. The development of the personal computer and of fiber-optic technology as the optimal means of conducting sound waves was seen to have enormous potential for communications. The twentieth century is closing with a vision of enormous channels of information—visual, factual, aural—flowing into offices, schools, homes, and even personal devices that could potentially link us all together in a vast communications network.  1946

ENIAC

Bush had devised a computer that made use of radio tubes as electronic switches in addition to the usual mechanical parts (see 1930).

The obvious next step was to make an entirely electronic computer, with no moving mechanical parts at all. This was done by the American engineers John William Mauchly (1907-1980) and John Presper Eckart, Jr. (b. 1919), who devised the first practical electronic digital computer in 1946. It was called ENIAC (electronic numerical integrator and computer).

It was an enormous, energy-guzzling device, weighing 30 tons and taking up 1,500 square feet of space. Though it was a wonder of its time, ENIAC was retired some nine years after it had been set up. It was by then hopelessly obsolete, for its descendants were growing steadily smaller, cheaper, more efficient, and much more capable.

Microwave Reflection from the Moon

Thanks to radar, it was possible to detect microwave reflections from airplanes, and from the reflections to calculate the distance and direction of the airplanes. In principle, there was no reason this could not be done for an astronomical body.

In 1946 a Hungarian scientist, Zoltan Lajos Bay, sent a beam of microwaves to the Moon and detected the reflection. The time it took for the reflection to return could be used to determine the distance of the Moon at the time of reflection with far greater precision than had ever been possible before.

1944,Nuclear Magnetic Resonance,"['Felix Bloch', 'Edward Mills Purcell']",['American'],"It is possible for chemical substances to absorb certain frequencies of microwave radiation when those substances are in a strong, steady, and homogeneous magnetic field. The frequen-

cies that are absorbed depend on the magnetic properties of the atoms involved.

In particular, atomic nuclei act as tiny spinning magnets, and these can be lined up in a magnetic field, to strengthen the microwave absorption. The Swiss-born American physicist Felix Bloch (1905— 1983) and the American physicist Edward Mills Purcell (b. 1912) independently developed this technique in 1946, and for it they shared the Nobel Prize for physics in 1952,

The technique, named nuclear magnetic resonance (NMR), provided a noninvasive way of studying the interior of living organisms. Since microwaves are far less energetic than X rays, they are correspondingly less likely to do damage to tissues. Then too, X rays are best at detecting massive atoms, of which there are few in the body, while NMR detects light atoms, particularly hydrogen, and these are plentiful in the body.

The use of NMR is growing more common, but because of public fears of the word nuelear (thinking that it implies the existence

of destructive radiation— definitely not so in this case), physicians commonly speak of it simply as magnetic resonance.

1944,Bacterial Genetics,"['Organisms', 'Joshua Lederberg']","['American', 'Tatum']","It had long been customary to think of reproduction in the simplest organisms as essentially simpler than that in multicellular ones. Organisms such as ourselves reproduce by means

of sex and the intermingling of genetic material from male and female. A one-celled organism, however, seems able simply to divide, making use of only its own genetic material. It would seem that evolution should proceed much faster in multicellular than in unicellular organisms over a given number of generations because of this intermingling of genetic material. The shuffling of genes might represent the great biological advantage of sexual reproduction.

In 1946, however, the American geneticist Joshua Lederberg (b. 1925), working with Tatum (see 1941), showed that bacterial reproduction was not entirely asexual. Different strains of bacteria could be crossed in such a way as to make the genetic material intermingle. It was therefore possible for organisms even as simple as bacteria to engage, on occasion, in what is essentially sexual reproduction.

Both showed that the genetic material of different strains of viruses could be combined to form a new strain different from either. This too is a form of sexual reproduction, and for this Delbriick and Hershey received shares of the Nobel Prize for physiology and medicine in 1969.

Cloud-Seeding

The American physicist Vincent Joseph Schaefer (b. 1906) had been working with Langmuir (see 1913) on the phenomenon of icing, particularly in reference to airplanes flying at high altitudes, which could develop layers of ice on their wings that could cause them to crash.

To study the production of ice crystals, Schaefer and Langmuir used a refrigerated box kept well below the freezing point of water. They hoped that in the box, water vapor would condense around dust particles to form ice crystals. It was important, however, to find just the proper types of dust particles to use as seeds for ice formation, and the experiments therefore continued for some time.

In July 1946, during a  heat wave, Schaefer dropped some solid carbon dioxide into the box to cool it more eflectively. Promptly, ice crystals formed and a miniature snowstorm whirled inside the box. Solid carbon dioxide might therefore help in cloud-seeding.

On November 13, 1946, Schaefer was flown by air-

plane over a cloud layer in

western Massachusetts and dumped 6 pounds of pellets of frozen carbon dioxide. A

snowstorm started.

In mild weather, such an artificial snowstorm started at high altitudes would, of course, turn to rain as it fell. Nevertheless, rain-making never became important. In the first

place, it worked only if the proper kinds of clouds were present—in other words, if it was likely to rain in any case. In the second place, rain that might be helpful to some people would invariably be harmful to others, so that to make rain artificially would be to ask for an infinite amount of litigation.

Meanwhile, the English physicist Cecil Frank Powell (1903-1969) had worked out a new method of particle detection. Instead of having particles strike a cloud chamber and then photographing the results, he had the particles strike a photographic emulsion so that the result could be recorded directly.

In 1947 he exposed photographic plates in the Bolivian Andes and picked up evidence of a particle of intermediate mass that was not the one Anderson had discovered. Powell named it the pi-meson, which was

eventually shortened to pion.

Whereas Anderson’s muon had all the properties of an electron except for its greater mass, so that it was a lepton, the pion shared certain properties with the more massive particles and was lumped with them as a hadron. The pion interacted readily with protons and neutrons (as the muon did not) and had all the properties required for it to be Yukawa's predicted particle.

For this work, Powell was awarded the Nobel Prize for physics in 1950.

1947,Carbon-14 Dating,"['Martin David Kamen', 'Willard Frank Libby', 'Libby', 'Libby Nebula', 'Radio Source', 'Jansky', 'John C. Bolton']","['American', 'Egyptian', 'Turin', 'Australian']","Seven years before, Martin David Kamen had discovered carbon-14 and found it to have a surprisingly long half-life, some 5,700 years. In 1947 the American chemist Willard Frank Libby (1908—1980) put the isotope to important use.

It had turned out that cosmic ray bombardment converted some of the nitrogen-14 of the atmosphere into carbon-14. New carbon-14 was formed as old

carbon-14 broke down radioactively, so that an equilibrium was achieved. A given very small quantity of it always remained in the Earth’s atmosphere.

Libby reasoned that plants absorbed carbon dioxide in the course of photosynthesis, so that carbon atoms from the gas found their way into the molecules of plant tissues. This must include a very small quantity of carbon-14, since it was always present in atmospheric carbon dioxide. Despite the fact that this carbon-14 was present in terribly small amounts, its concentration could be determined because the beta particles it liberated could be detected with great precision.

Once a plant died, however, no further carbon-14 would be absorbed, so that what carbon-14 it contained would slowly break down without being replaced. By determining the concentration of carbon-14 in the remains of a once-living plant, the amount of time that had elapsed since the organism had died could be determined with surprising accuracy.

This meant that the age of old samples of wood, parchment, textiles, and so on could be determined, even if they were as old as 45,000 years or so.

This opened the door to judging the age of Egyptian mummies, of wood from structures built in prehistoric times, and of such historic and possibly ancient objects as the Dead Sea scrolls and the Shroud of Turin.

For this, Libby received the Nobel Prize for chemistry in 1960.

Crab Nebula as Radio Source

It had been sixteen years since Jansky first detected radio waves from outer space (see 1932), but only since World War II had techniques been developed that permitted handling of the microwave radiation used in radar. These techniques could now be applied to astronomy.

In 1947 the Australian astronomer John C. Bolton had a radio telescope that was capable of locating a radio source with sufficient precision to associate it with an object that could be identified optically. Thus he found that the third strongest radio source

in the sky was clearly the Crab Nebula, which was the remains of a great supernova explosion (see 1054).

The Crab Nebula was the first optical object discovered to be a radio source, and this was the first indication that radio astronomy might offer a technique for making discoveries that were not apparent from the simple study of visible light itself.

1947,Martian Atmosphere,"['Schiaparelli', 'Mars', 'Gerard Peter Kuiper', 'Mars Mars']","['Mars', 'American', 'Martian', 'Lipmann']","Since Schiaparelli had first detected the “canals” of Mars (see 1877), a feeling had persisted among nonastronomers, and even among some astronomers, that there might be life on Mars.

In 1947, however, the Dutch-born American astronomer Gerard Peter Kuiper (1905-1973) analyzed the reflected infrared light of Mars and reported that the Martian atmosphere seemed to be almost entirely carbon dioxide. There was no sign of nitrogen, oxygen, or water vapor. With that, the notion of an advanced civilization on Mars, or of any but possibly the simplest forms of life, went glimmering.

Coenzyme A

The carbohydrates, fats, and proteins of food, in the course of their metabolism, all break down to an acetyl group, also called a nvo-carbon fragment. This is then built up again to form the substances characteristic of an organism’s own tissues. In 1947 Lipmann (see 1941) was able to isolate a substance that was essential to the transfer of the acetyl group from one compound to another. He called it coenzyme A, where the A stood for acetyl group. The structure of coenzyme A was found to include that of pantothenic acid, one of the B vitamins. Pantothenic acid is essential to life and must be present in our food, because the human body cannot form it within its own tissues, cannot form coenzyme A without it, and cannot run metabolic changes without coenzyme A.

Chloramphenicol attacked many different microorganisms and was the first broad-spectrum antibiotic to be isolated. It was fairly toxic, however, and had to be used carefully.

1947,Holography,"['Suppose', 'Dennis Gabor', 'Gabor']","['Photography', 'British']","Photography had been in existence for over a century (see 1839). It worked by allowing a beam of light to be reflected from an object and fall upon a photographic film. The film recorded a two-dimensional pattern of the reflected beam, but the information was limited by the loss of the third dimension. Suppose, instead, that a beam of light were split in two. One part would strike an object and be reflected with all the irregularities the object would impose on it. The second part would be reflected from a mirror, with no irregularities imposed on it. The two parts would meet at the photographic film, where the interference pattern would be recorded. The film, when developed, would then seem to be blank, but if light were made to pass through the film, it would take on the interference characteristics and produce a three-dimensional image, conveying far

more information than an ordinary photograph. The three-dimensional image would be called a holograph (where the prefix means “the whole thing""—that is, all three dimensions).

This notion was first worked out in 1947 by a Hungarian-born British physicist, Dennis Gabor (1900-1979), but though the theory was sound, it could not be reduced to practice without further advances in optics. Once such advances took place, Gabor was awarded the Nobel Prize for physics, in 1971.

1947,Supersonic Flight,"['Bullets', 'Charles Elwood Yeager']",['American'],"Since the invention of the airplane (see 1903), planes had been going faster and faster, but propellers can only whirl so fast and it seemed that the speed limit for planes was bound to be less than the speed of sound, which is about 740 miles per hour. Once jet planes were devised during World War II (see 1941), however, the possibility of planes moving faster than sound (supersonic flight) arose.

The difficulty is that, at their fastest, air molecules move at the speed of sound. As long as a plane moves at a lesser speed, the air molecules ahead will move easily out of the way. At the speed of sound or beyond, the air molecules cannot move out of the way before being overtaken. They pile up ahead of the plane, which thus flies into compressed air.

This was viewed, dramatically, as flying into a wall, and people began to speak of a sound barrier. Actually, there is no such thing. Bullets and shells can move faster than sound, as can the tip of a bullwhip. As air piles up, it eventually slips to one side  and expands again, making a noise called a sonic boom The crack of a bullwhip is a miniature sonic b

does set up vibrations and in a plane, hownd in o o attain and exceed the sy sound, a plane must be carefully engineered to withstand those stresses. On October 14, 1947, the American test pilot Charles Elwood Yeager, flying an X-1 rocket plane,

1948,Transistor,"['William Bradford Shockley', 'Walter Houser Brattain', 'John Bardeen', 'Shockley', 'John Robinson Pierce', 'Peter Carl Goldmark']","['American', 'American American']","When radio was in its infancy, crystals were used as rectifiers, allowing alternating current to pass in only one direction. These were unreliable, however, and such crystal sets were quickly replaced by sets containing radio tubes (see 1904), which had now been in use in various electronic instruments, including the new computers, for over forty years.

Radio tubes have to be large enough to enclose a vacuum, however. They are fragile, spring leaks, and frequently have to be replaced. They are also energy-hungry, and one must wait for the filament to heat up before the machine starts working.

In 1948 three physicists, William Bradford Shockley (b. 1910), Walter Houser Brattain (1902~ 1987), and John Bardeen (b. 1908)—all American, though Shockley was British-born—discovered a new kind of crystal. It consisted chiefly of germanium, which conducted an electric current less well than metals but better than such insulators as glass and rub-

ber. Germanium—and silicon, which ina few years replaced germanium, since silicon was both cheaper and better—were considered examples of semiconductors.

If traces of certain impurities were added to the semiconductor, the crystal could serve as a rectifier or as an amplifier. It could, in short, perform any function that tubes could.

These semiconductors were solid (hence solid-state devices) and required no vacuum, so that they could be made quite small. They were rugged, so that they almost never needed replacing. They used very little energy, and they required no heating, so that they began working at once. A fellow worker, the American electrical engineer John Robinson Pierce (b. 1910), suggested that the device be called a rransistor, because it transmitted current across a resistor.

With time, transistors replaced tubes completely. Transistors and the improvements that followed may well prove to be the most significant technological advance of the rwentieth century.

Long-Playing Records

Until now, records had revolved at the rate of 78 times a minute. In 1948 the Hungarian-born American physicist Peter Carl Goldmark (1906—1977) developed a record that turned only 335 times a minute. Between that and narrowing the track, or needle groove, six times more music could be placed on a single record than had been possible earlier. An entire symphony could now fit on one record.

To shoot down an attacking airplane, one must know the speed and direction of the plane's movements, the speed and direction of the wind, the speed of the projectile aimed at the airplane, and other factors as well. To do all this accurately and well, computers were needed that were far better than those available at the time.

Weiner grew interested in working out the mathematical basis of the communication of information and of the control of a system in the light of such communication. By 1948 he had summarized his work in a book entitled Cybernetics. This was the first important book devoted to computer control,

1948,Nuclear Structure,"['Maria', 'Johannes Hans Daniel Jensen', 'Jensen']","['American', 'German']","The chemical properties of atoms depend on the arrangement of their electrons into shells. This is what makes the periodic table of the elements work (see 1916).

The nuclear properties of atoms must depend on the arrangement of the protons and neutrons in the nuclei. They, too, might be arranged in shells, but if so, this would be more difficult to determine than in the case of the outer electrons.

The German-born American physicist Maria Goeppert-Mayer (1906— 1972) tried to work out the nature of the nuclear shells [rom the nuclear properties that had been observed for different atoms. She showed that nuclei that contained 2, 8, 20, 50, 82, or 126 protons or neutrons would be more stable than

their neighbors in the periodic table. These were called shell numbers, or more dramatically but less scientifically, magic numbers. If 28 or 40 protons or neutrons were present, some stability resulted, and these were called semimagic numbers.

Goeppert-Mayer advanced her notions in 1948, at about the same time a German physicist, Johannes Hans Daniel Jensen (1907-1973), advanced the same views. As a result, Goeppert-Mayer and Jensen received shares of the Nobel Prize for physics in 1963.

This theory was called quantum electrodynamics, and it proved so successful that it has been used as a model for the attempted working out of equations

governing the behavior of particles subjected to the

In 1948 Gamow (see 1929) considered the consequences of this explosion (which he called the big bang) in far greater detail. He was the first to attempt to work out how the chemical elements were formed in the aftermath of the explosion.

He also predicted that the big bang had resulted in a vast surge of energy, and that the Universe had cooled off as it expanded until it was now, on the average, just a few degrees above absolute zero. As a result, there should be a background of microwave radiation coming equally from all parts of the sky, with a wavelength suitable to a universe at such a temperature.  Miranda

For almost a century, Uranus had been known to have four satellites. In 1948, however, Kuiper, who had described the atmosphere of Mars (see 1947), located a fifth Uranian satellite. It was smaller than the other four and closer to Uranus. Since three of the satellites had been named for spirits from Shakespeare's plays—Oberon and Titania from A Midsummer Night's Dream and Ariel from The Tempest —Kuiper named the new satellite Miranda, alter the heroine of The Tempest. Miranda was the first satellite to be named after a human being rather than a god, a goddess, or a spirit, although it was a fictional human being, to be sure.

Nucleic AcidBase Balance

It was now known that nucleic acids were large and very complex molecules, especially since Avery had shown that deoxyribonucleic acid (DNA) and not protein was the carrier of physical characteristics (see 1944). It was DNA, in short, that made up the genes of the chromosomes. The question was: Just what was it about the struc-

ture of nucleic acids that made it possible for them to carry the vast amount of information that genes must carry in order to make human eggs develop into human beings and grasshopper eggs into grasshoppers, without the reverse ever happening?

Part of the structure of DNA was known to be four different bases. Two of them (adenine and guanine) were purines with a two-ring molecule, and two of them (cytosine and thymine) were pyrimidines with a one-ring molecule.

The Austrian-born American biochemist Erwin Chargaff (b. 1905) broke down nucleic acid molecules to their constituent bases and separated them by paper chromatography. He determined the quantity of each present and by 1948 was able to demonstrate that, in nucleic acids generally, the number of guanine units was equal to the number of cytosine units, and the number of adenine units was equal to the number of thymine units. This meant that the number of purine units was equal to the number of pyrimidine units.

This was a more important discovery than Chargaff apparently realized at the time, and he did not follow it up properly.

1948,Cyanocobalamine,"['Murphy', 'Karl August Folkers']","['Minot', 'American']","Minot and Murphy had demonstrated that there was a dictary factor in liver that reversed the onslaught of pernicious anemia (see 1926). The nature of the factor was not casily determined, however, since its presence or absence could only be detected by following the slow changes in pernicious anemia patients,

In 1948, the American chemist Karl August Folkers (b. 1906) discovered that this factor, usually called vitamin B-12, was necessary for the growth of certain bacteria. The presence or absence of the vitamin in various fractions of liver could now easily be determined from the reaction of bacteria, and very soon, red crystals of the pure vitamin were isolated.

Eventually, analysis showed the vitamin to have perhaps the most complicated molecule known that was not simply a long chain of repeated single units. It was required by the body in exceedingly small doses, a thousandth that of other vitamins. The molecule possessed a cvanide group and a cobalt atom, neither of which was present in other known substances in living tissue. For

that reason it was named cyanocobalamine.

Its existence made pernicious anemia easily treated without the necessity for eating excessive amounts of liver.

Pregnancy and attacks of jaundice relieved its symptoms, so he conjectured that it was not a germ disease but a disorder of metabolism.

Hench tried various substances, including hormones, in the search for something that would relieve the symptoms. A decade earlier, the adrenocortical hormones had been isolated by Kendall (see 1935, Cortisone), and it occurred to Hench that these ought to be tried. His role as a colonel in the Army Medical Corps during World War II delayed him, but after the war he began working with the new hormones. He tried Compound E, also called cortisone, which had been isolated in 1946, and in 1948 found that it worked well. For

this he received a share, along with Kendall, of the Nobel Prize for medicine and physiology in 1950. Cortisone proved to be a tricky substance, however, to be used only with great care and judgment.

1948,Tissue Transplantation,['George Snell'],['American'],"It is important for the body to have weapons against foreign proteins, since these may well represent portions of parasites or their toxins that will cause sickness or death. The body needs an immune mechanism that can produce antibodies that will combine

with the foreign proteins and render them harmless.

At times, however, foreign proteins help preserve life. A piece of tissue from one person may be transferred to another because the person receiving the tissue badly needs it. If the person receiving it then activates an immune mechanism to fight it off and reject it, it may mean death.

The American geneticist George Snell (b. 1903) studied this phenomenon. He believed the capacity of an organism to reject tissue from another organism involved genetic factors. Working with mice, by 1948 he had located the sites of specific genes (histocompatibility genes) that were concerned in the matter of acceptance or rejection. This was a step toward making tissue transplantation practical.

For this he received a share of the Nobel Prize for medicine and physiology in 1980.

1948,Virus Culture,"['Petri', 'John Franklin Enders', 'Thomas Huckle Weller', 'Frederick Chapman Robbins']",['American'],"A great many of the advances in the fight against bacterial infection over the previous three-quarters of a century had resulted from the ability to grow pure bacterial cultures in the  laboratory. This meant the bacteria could be studied easily and methods for slowing or stopping

their growth could be developed.

Viruses, however, grow only within living cells, and working with organisms is much slower and less certain than working with Petri dishes. For this reason, viral diseases were far more difficult to fight than bacterial diseases.

Of course one needn't grow the viruses in adult organisms. They could be grown in the developing embryos in chicken eggs, or in those same embryo cells mixed with blood. The trouble was that although viruses would grow there, so would bacteria, and the bacteria would mask the viruses.

Once penicillin became available, however, it could be added to the chicken embryo broth. This prevented the growth of bacteria but did not affect the viruses. The American microbiologist John Franklin Enders (1897-1985) developed this technique in 1948, and it be-

came useful in searching for ways to fight viral diseases, notably poliomyelitis (infantile paralysis).

The Soviets had been working on fission bombs for years, however, and were clever enough to gain knowledge of some of the American techniques. On September 22, 1949, the Soviets exploded their first fission bomb, and Americans were jarred out of their complacency. In place of a world dominated by a benevolent America with a monopoly on a benevolent atomic bomb, there were now two superpowers that soon became fully capable of wiping each other out, along with the rest of the world.

The nations of the world descended into a nuclear nightmare, from which they have not yet awakened.

Sickle-Cell Anemia

Sickle-cell anemia is a disease that produces distorted red cells, which are unable to transport oxygen properly. It particularly afflicts blacks, and these afflicted tend to die in childhood. It was first noted in 1910 by an American physician, James Bryan Herrick (1861-1954).

It seemed clearly to be a genetic disease, and in 1949 Linus Pauling (see 1931) was able to show that a defective gene produced the abnormal hemoglobin. If this gene was present on only one of a chromosome pair, the carriers possessed sickle-cell trait. These carriers could lead reasonably normal lives and also be relatively resistant to malaria, since their blood was apparently less palatable to the malarial parasite.

With a defective gene on each of a chromosome pair, however, the carriers had sickle-cell anemia itself. The beneficial effect of a single dose kept the defective gene going, while the deleterious effect of a double dose tended to wipe it out. The total effect was to keep an equilibrium quantity in existence in some regions where malaria was particularly prevalent.

LN

This was a case of a molecular disease, since an abnormal molecule, genetically produced, was the cause. Later a number of different abnormal hemoglobin molecules were found. Hemoglobin A was the normal molecule, and hemoglobin S the abnormal molecule that led to sicklecell anemia.

Analysis of the amino acid content of these two varieties of hemoglobin eventually showed that they differed in a single amino acid out of a chain made up of three hundred or so. It was a remarkable display of the serious conseguences of a tiny abnormality.

pable of rejecting foreign proteins. And in fact, when he inoculated mice embryos with tissue cells from another strain, he found that rejection did not take place. Furthermore, when such embryos entered independent life and could form antibodies, they no longer treated cells from the other strain as foreign proteins. By 1949 Medawar had shown how this technique might lead to reducing the difficulties of tissue transplantation. For this he received a share of the Nobel Prize for medicine and physiology in 1960.

All the amino acids are essential to the body structure, but eight of them are essential in the diet, where human beings are concerned, and it is these eight that are considered the essential amino acids. This was definitely established by Rose in 1949.

1949,Cometary Structure,['Fred Lawrence Whipple'],['American'],"The approach of a comet to the Sun results in the development of a hazy coma and a tail. The American astronomer Fred Lawrence Whipple (b. 1906) suggested in 1949 that this could be explained by supposing that comets were essentially icy in nature, made up of an admixture of silicate dust and gravel (and in some cases perhaps, a small rocky core). When heated by the Sun’s closeness, cometary ice vaporized explosively, and the dust it contained formed the haze and the tail. In short, a comet is a “dirty snowball.”

This suggestion was { readily adopted by most astronomers, and few, if any, doubt it now.  1950

1949,Cometary Cloud,"['Jan Hendrik Oort', 'Solar System', 'Earth', 'Qort']",['Dutch'],"It had been clear for at least a century that comets were comparatively shortlived phenomena. At every approach to the Sun, a substantial quantity of a comet’s mass must evaporate, never to return (assuming it to be a “dirty snowball”""—see 1949). Even a large comet could only endure a few thousand returns to the neighborhood of the Sun, and some comets had actually been seen to fragment on their passage past the Sun.

Why then were not all comets long since gone? It

seemed to the Dutch astronomer Jan Hendrik Oort (b. 1900) that a vast reservoir of them must exist. In 1950 he suggested that a huge spherical cloud of icy comets, perhaps a hundred billion of them altogether, must exist within an area 1 to 2 light-years from the Sun. They might represent the outermost material from the original nebula, left behind by the condensation of the inner material into the Sun and the planets 4.6 billion years ago and unchanged ever since.

Every once in a while, sions or the gravita-

tional pull of one of the nearer stars might alter rotational velocities and allow a comet to fall into the inner Solar System, where observers on Earth could see it. Qort estimated that perhaps 20 percent of the original cloud had thus been hurled inward (or outward into interstellar space), but an ample number remained to supply more comets for the indefinite future.

1949,Pluto’s Diameter,"['Pluto', 'Uranus', 'Neptune', 'Pluto Earth', 'Pluto Mars', 'Pluto Neptune']","['Uranus', 'Kuiper', 'Miranda', 'Nereid', 'Uranus Uranus']","Pluto had been discovered by considering the unexplained perturbation of Uranus’s orbit, assuming that the gravitational pull of an undiscovered planet caused it, and calculating the place where that planet must be (see 1930). (Neptune had also been discovered in this way—see 1846—but its presence had not corrected all of the perturbation of Uranus, just most of it.)

For Pluto to have caused the perturbation, it would have to be several times as massive as Earth, and at first this was assumed to be the case, but it turned out to be considerably dimmer than would be expected of a massive planet, and that caused considerable consternation.

In 1950 Kuiper, the discoverer of Miranda (see 1948) and Nereid (see 1949), managed to see Pluto as a disk and to measure its apparent width. He showed that its diameter could not be more than 3,600 miles, which made it smaller than Mars and explained its dimness. If Pluto was as small as this, it could not be the source of the perturbation of Uranus, and it must have been located in the right spot by sheer coincidence.

This would seem to indicate that a planet massive enough to account for the perturbations of Uranus must still exist beyond Neptune’s orbit, but if so, it has not yet been located.

1949,Turing Machine,"['Alan Mathison Turing', 'Turing', 'Pascal', 'Arthur L.

(Turing had been instrumental in breaking the German secret code-machine during World War II, which had made it possible to anticipate German moves and thus been of major importance in helping to defeat the Nazis.)

In 1950 Turing showed that, in principle, a very simple machine capable of an astonishingly few moves could solve any problem capable of being formulated in mathematical terms. This Turing machine went a long way toward convincing workers in the field that something one might call artificial intelligence could exist.

Turing also pointed out how one could decide whether artificial intelligence had been achieved: if one could carry on a conversation with some hidden entity without being able to demonstrate from the conversation alone whether

that entity was a human being or not, and if that entity was a machine, it displayed artificial intelligence.

Game-Playing Computers

It was natural to think of computers at first simply as very fast calculating machines, different from Pascal’s first adding device (see 1642) in degree but not in kind.

However, it quickly became apparent that computers could solve problems that human beings considered to require human thought. Thus in 1947 the American engineer Arthur L. Samuel (b. 1901) had worked out a checkerplaying computer, refinements of which eventually proved capable of playing championship checkers.

Checkers, however, is a comparatively simple game. In 1950 the American mathematician Claude Elwood Shannon (b. 1916) suggested ways to design a chess-playing computer, and such machines have since been built and play excellent games of chess. Indeed, it is not beyond the limits of probability that such a machine might become the world’s chess champion.

Such devices further  exemplify the potential reality of artificial intelligence.

1951,Breeder Reactors,[],['American'],"The nuclear reactors built during the first decade of the atomic age depended

on the fission of uranium235. This is a relatively rare isotope of uranium, making up only 0.7 percent of the whole.

Then it was discovered that if such reactors were

built with ordinary uranium-238 in a jacket around the core, enough neutrons could be made to stream into the uranium-238 to form plutonium atoms, which are fissionable. If or

dinary thorium-232 is in the surrounding jacket, fissionable uranium-233 will be formed.

Such breeder reactors will actually breed more fissionable fuel in the jackets than is consumed in the core, and this means that all the uranium and thorium supply of the world can serve as potential fission fuel, rather than the rare uranium-235 alone. The vision of endless cheap energy reached its peak at this time, with few to predict that concerns about reactor safety and radioactive ash would destroy the American nuclear energy industry.

It was well known that nuclear fusion, as in the conversion of hydrogen to helium taking place in the stars, would yield up to seven times as much energy, weight for weight, as nuclear fission. Moreover, the ultimate fusion fuel, hydrogen, is available in virtually unlimited quantities on Earth and is easily obtained, as compared with the rarer and far more difficult to extract uranium and thorium needed as fission fuel. Still further, fusion produces

less dangerous products than fission does.

However, whereas nuclear fission can be initiated at room temperature, through the use of slow neutrons, nuclear fusion requires the high temperatures and pressures found at the center of stars.

Uncontrolled fusion is comparatively simple. Some way can be found to include hydrogen and other light elements with an ordinary fission bomb in such a way that the fission explosion produces sufficient temperature and pressure to ignite the much more powerful and destructive fusion explosion. The result would be a nuclear fusion bomb, more popularly known as a hydrogen bomb, or an H-bomb. 1t can also be called a thermonuclear device, where thermomeans “‘heat,” because that's what is needed.

The fact that the Soviet Union had developed its own fission bomb made some scientists, notably the violently anti-Seviet physicist Edward Teller (see 1939), feel that the United States should immediately develop a hydrogen bomb in order to maintain its preponderance of power. Other scientists, notably Robert Oppenheimer (see 1937), sickened at the thought of the damage such bombs

could do and aware that the Soviets would then simply match it, were oppased. The political decision was to go ahead with the Hbomb, and Teller saw to it that Oppenheimer’s opposition was used to put an end to his career.

Meanwhile, an attempt began to devise a way to produce controlled hydrogen fusion as a source of peaceful energy—a much harder task. It would be necessary to raise the temperature of hydrogen to tens or even hundreds of millions of degrees, while confining this ultrahot hydrogen long enough to allow fusion to begin.

At this temperature, however, hydrogen’s tendency is to expand explosively and be gone unless it is tightly enclosed. No material container would do, for either the hot hydrogen would melt the container or the cold container would cool off the hydrogen.

The hydrogen might be confined by a magnetic field, however. It would then merely be necessary to devise some way of shaping a magnetic field that was strong enough to do the job.

In 1951 the American physicist Lyman Spitzer, Jr. (b. 1914) supervised the construction of a figure-8 device called a stellarator

(from the Latin word for “star,” because it was trying to duplicate what went on in stars) that might confine hot hydrogen gas efficiently. Later, a modified version developed in the Soviet Union and called a Tokamnak (an abbreviation of a descriptive Russian phrase) was used.

In nearly forty years of trying, however, nuclear fusion ignition has not been achieved, though progress continues to be made.

This demonstrated the value of radio waves in detecting the presence of given atoms and molecules in interstellar space. The wavelengths of the radiation emitted were characteristic of different substances and acted as “fingerprints.”

Living within it as we do, we naturally lack the ability to view it from-without, from which point of view its structure would become obvious.

By 1951, however, astronomers could detect radio wave emissions with great delicacy, and the American astronomer William Wilson Morgan (b. 1906) could make out the characteristic radio waves of ionized hydrogen coming from particularly hot, bright stars that were themselves characteristic of the spiral arms of galaxies. When several such lines of ionized hydrogen were found coming from our galaxy, it seemed convincing evidence that the Milky Way Galaxy had spiral arms. Our palaxy was thus revealed to be a spiral galaxy much like the Andromeda Galaxy. Our Sun is located in one of these spiral arms.

In 1951 John Bardeen, who had participated in the discovery of the transistor (see 1948), helped work out a theoretical consideration of the phenomenon, making use of quantum effects, that seemed to explain a good deal. It was good enough, in fact, for Bardeen to be awarded the Nobel Prize for physies in 1972. Since  he had also shared in that prize in 1956 for the discovery of the transistor, he became the first person ever to receive two Nobel Prizes in physics.

1952,Nuclear Fusion Bomb,"['Great Britain', 'Oppenheimer']","['American', 'United States', 'China']","The American effort to produce a nuclear fusion bomb (hydrogen bomb) was soon successful. Hydrogen-2 fused at a lower temperature than hydrogen-1, and hydrogen-3 fused at a lower temperature still. Hydrogen-2 was a rare isotope of hydrogen, but there was enough present in the Earth's oceans to last humanity for billions of years. Hydrogen-3 was radiocactive and had to be formed through nuclear reactions if enough was to be obtained for use. It was planned to fuse a mixture of hydrogen2 and hydrogen-3 in liquid form by exposure to the temperatures and pressures produced by a fission bomb.

Such a fusion bomb was tested on a coral atoll in the Pacific Ocean on November 1, 1952, wiping out the atoll. The blast vielded energy equivalent to 10,000,000 tons (10 megatons) of TNT—five hundred times the 20-kiloton energy of the Hiroshima bomb.

Yet it did not give the United States security.

Within a year, the Soviets had exploded a fusion bomb of their own.

The ravening energies of the fusion bomb explosion in the Pacific (see above) had driven nuclei together and formed atoms even more complex than californium (element

number 98), which was at the time the most complex known (see 1949). As a result, elements 99 and 100 were formed and detected.

In 1952, however, two Polish physicists, Marian Danysz and Jerzy Pniewski, discovered another intermediate-sized particle. It was about 3.5 times as massive as a pion but still only half as massive as a proton or neutron and was called a K-meson, which was sometimes abbreviated to kaon.

These same physicists went on that year to discover, among the products  of cosmic ray collisions, a subatomic particle that was more massive than a proton or a neutron, This came to be called a lambda particle. It was 1.2 times as massive as a proton.

Other particles more massive than a proton were eventually discovered and called hyperons. Mesons, nucleons (protons and neutrons), and hyperons were all grouped together as hadrons, from a Greek word meaning “thick” or “strong,” since they were all subject to the strong interaction. Electrons, muons, and neutrinos, subject to the weak interaction, were called leptons, from a Greek word meaning “weak.”

While the number of leptons remained small, the number of hadrons rose steeply as the years passed, in the end reaching about a hundred. It was this that convinced physicists their notions of subatomic structure were incomplete; the large number of hadrons was too complicated a factor. There had to be some new view that would simplify the matter.

Origin of Life Evidence of living things, in the form of traces of tiny

bacterial cells, has been found in rocks that are 3.5

billion years old. Since the Earth is 4.6 billion years old, this means that in the first billion years of Earth’s existence, living things must have evolved from nonliving chemicals. Presumably, they must have evolved from the molecules that made up the huge nebula of dust and gas out of which the Solar System was formed.

It is reasonably well established that the Universe is 99 percent hydrogen and helium in a 9-to-1 ratio, with oxygen, carbon, nitrogen, neon, sulfur, silicon, iron, and argon most important among the final 1 percent. Of these, helium, neon, and argon form no compounds. In the presence of a preponderance of hydrogen, the oxygen, carbon, nitrogen, and sulfur form water, methane, ammonia, and hydrogen sulfide respectively. Silicon combines with oxygen and various metals to form silicates, which are rocky substances, while iron mixes with other less common metals.

Earth therefore began with a core of nickel-iron, surrounded by a rocky mantle and crust. All of that was topped by an ocean of water and an atmosphere that may have consisted of ammonia, methane, and hydrogen sulfide (with some

of each dissolved in the water). The simple compounds in the atmosphere and ocean would have been subjected to the energy of the Sun’s radiation and, through the addition of such energy, might have built up very gradually into more complicated substances until objects complex enough to be considered alive were the result.

In 1952 the American chemist Stanley Lloyd Miller (b. 1930), working under Harold Urey (see 1931), attempted for the first time to check this possibility by experimentation.

Miller began with carefully purified and sterilized water and added an “atmosphere” of hydrogen, ammonia, and methane. He circulated this through his apparatus and past an electric discharge that would add energy. He kept this up for a week. He then analyzed the solution and found organic compounds and even a few of the simpler amino acids formed abiogenetically, that is, without the presence of life.

Others later continued the work, using other sources of energy and other mixtures of simple compounds. They also added to the mix more complex compounds that had been formed in other experi

ments of the sort. None of this served to ascertain the exact route by which life was formed, but it all helped make it seem likely that life did start by some route that involved the action of chemical and physical laws, so that no supernatural cause need be sought.

X-Ray Diffraction of DNA

The fine structure of DNA had to be worked out if indeed such molecules were the carriers of genetic information. Chargaff had made a start by showing that the number of purine groups was equal to the number of pyrimidine groups (see 1948), but there was much more to be done.

Since nucleic acids were long-chain polymers of nucleotides, there ought to be certain periodic regularities in the molecule (as in crystals—see 1914) that would show up in X-ray diffraction.

In 1952 the English biophysicist Rosalind Elsie Franklin (1920-1958) made careful X-ray diffraction studies of DNA, from which she deduced that the molecule ought to be helical (like a spiral staircase),

with the phosphate groups that bound the units together located on the outside of the helix.

Franklin was a slow and careful worker, however, and did not wish to announce a result without carefully checking every step. This, combined with the fact that her coworkers tended to ignore her because she was a woman, resulted in the fruits of her labors going to benefit others.

1952,Insulin Structure,['Frederick Sanger'],['British'],"The use of paper chromatography (see 1944) had made it possible to determine the number of units of each amino acid in a particular protein molecule. If the molecules were broken down to fragments made up of two, three, or four amino acids connected together, these could also be isolated and identified. Once the fragments were identified, one could reason out the structure of longer stretches of the molecules by arguing that a certain long stretch would give rise to shorter pieces, all of which would be found among the fragments, but would not give rise to shorter pieces that were not

found there. In this way, little by little, working backward, one could work out the precise order of amino acids in the entire protein molecule.

A British biochemist, Frederick Sanger (b. 1918), used this painstaking method and, by 1952, could show that the molecule of the protein hormone insulin consisted of some fifty amino acids distributed among two interconnected chains. He was also able to demonstrate the exact order of the amino acids that made up each chain.

1952,Virus Nucleic,"['Joshua Lederberg', 'Lederberg']",[],". Acid There was no doubt by this time that nucleic acid was the genetic carrier in plant and animal cells and even in bacteria. That left viruses.

Viruses consist of an internal core of nucleic acid, either DNA or RNA, or sometimes both, and an outer shell of protein. In 1952 Alfred Hershey (see 1945) showed that when bacteriophages attacked the bacterial cells that were its natural prey, it was the DNA that actually entered

the cell and supervised the formation of both the DNA and protein components of the new viruses. The protein shell remained outside but presumably contained an enzyme that helped dissolve the cell wall and allow the entrance of the DNA.

Also in 1952, Joshua Lederberg (see 1946) showed that a bacteriophage could transfer genetic material from one infected cell to a new cell that it infected later. This meant that viruses could be used as tools for introducing genetic changes, or mutations. Lederberg termed this process transduction; it represented a technique with potential for genetic engineering.

This is done by making use of a substance containing a radioactive atom that will combine with the biologically active material in question. The presence of the radioactive atom can be detected and the extent of combination determined with great delicacy. This makes possible numerous significant tests (radioinmune assay) for the presence of significant antibodies, greatly aiding medical diagnosis and allowing doctors to follow the course of events in medical treatment.

For this work, Yalow shared in the Nobel Prize for physiology and medicine in 1977.

REM Sleep

Dreams were the subject of mystical theories in primitive times, being viewed as messages from some other realm not available to the waking senses. Freud (see 1900) initiated another form of dream analysis, but some think it has mystical components as well.

It was not till 1952 that straightforward observations were made concerning dreams, which didn't make use of the subjective reports of the dreamer. In that year the American psychologist William Charles Dement (b. 1928), studying sleeping subjects, noticed periods of rapid eye movement (REM) that sometimes persisted for minutes. During these periods of REM sleep, breathing, heartbeat, and blood pressure rose to waking levels. He noted that such REM sleep took up about a quarter of the sleeping time.

Sleepers who are awakened during these periods generally report that they were having a dream. Furthermore, a sleeper who is continually disturbed during these periods begins to suffer psychological distress. The periods of REM sleep are then multiplied during succeeding nights as

though to make up for the lost dreaming.

It would seem, then, that dreaming has some important function in maintaining the working efficiency of the complex human brain. In this connection, REM sleep has been found to oceur in infants to an even greater extent than in older individuals and to occur in mammals other than human beings, too. Exactly what the function of REM sleep and dreaming might be remains a matter of dispute, however.

Reserpine and other drugs of its nature came to

be called tranquilizers. They grew instantly popular with many people for use in the reduction (real or fancied) of tensions (real or fancied). They served, more seriously, as adjuncts to psychiatric treatment, for although they are in no sense a cure for any mental disease, they do calm violent patients without the use of harsh physical restraints, and calm patients may then more easily cooperate with the psychiatrist.

The components of the gas mixture were pushed along with the carrier gas at different speeds, so that the carrier arrived at the other

end with the components of the gas mixture separated. Such gas chromatography is particularly useful because of the speed of its separations and the great delicacy with which it can detect trace impurities.

The section of the rod that is enclosed softens and begins to melt, and as the rod is drawn through the hollow, the softened zone moves along its length. Any impurities in the rod tend to remain in the softened zone, so that they are washed to the end of the rod. After a few passes of this sort, the end can be cut off and what remains is unprecedentedly pure.

This is a most useful technique in preparing pure material that can then be “doped” with trace quantities of deliberately chosen impurities in concentrations suitable for solid-state electronic devices such as computers.

Helix The work of Chargaff and Franklin (see 1952) had supplied the information necessary to work out the structure of DNA. The key conceptual step was then taken by the English physicist Francis Harry Compton Crick (b. 1916) and the American biochemist James Dewey Watson (b. 1928). They made use of a key X-ray diffraction photograph taken by Franklin and made available to them by her boss, the New Zealand physicist Maurice Hugh Frederick Wilkins (b. 1916), apparently without Franklin’s knowledge or permission.

In 1953 Watson and Crick suggested that DNA consisted of two chains of nucleotides arranged as a double helix, with the purine and pyrimidine bases facing each other and the

phosphate links on the outside. Each two-ringed purine faced a one-ringed pyrimidine, so that the

space between the two strands was constant. Adenines and thymines were

pajred, as were guanines ik

and cytosines (thus accounting for Chargaff’s results).

Each strand of the double helix was a model (or template) for the other. In cell division, each DNA double helix would separate into two strands, and each strand would build up its complementary strand on itself; an adenine fitting over every thymine on the strand, a thymine over every adenine, a guanine over every cytosine, and a cytosine over every guanine. In this way two double helixes would appear where there had been one before. Thus DNA underwent replication without changing its structure except for very occasional accidental errors, which represented mutations.

The Watson-Crick structure made so much sense that it was accepted at once. Watson, Crick, and Wilkins shared the Nobel Prize for physiology and medicine in 1962 as a result. By that time Franklin was dead, and her involvement did not have to be considered.

ple units. Beginning with Bakelite (see 1909), these offered a variety of useful properties and came into steadily increasing use.

However, the technique of polymerization was a matter of random combination. The simple units were brought together and allowed to combine as they wished, so to speak. The result was that, instead of a single long chain, branches sometimes appeared. If there were atomic groups attached to the unit, these would jut outward in random directions along the chain. Such unpredictable aspects of the polymerization technigque limited its usefulness.

In 1953 a German chemist, Karl Ziegler (1898—1973), discovered that he could use a resin, to which ions of metals such as aluminum or titanium were attached, as a catalyst in the production of polyethylene. Chains without branching were then formed. As a result, the new polyethylene was tougher and higher-melting than the old.

The Italian chemist Giulio Natta (1903—1979) carried on this sort of work and found that he could use such catalysts to insure that the side groups of a unit would all point in the same direction when a poly-

mer formed. At Mrs. Natta’s suggestion, these were called isotactic polymers, from Greek words meaning “ordered in the same way.”

1953,Plate Tectonics,"['Maurice Ewing', 'Bruce Charles Heezen', 'Africa', 'Arabia', 'Earth']","['American', 'California', 'California Greek', 'Asia', 'America']","For thirty years it had been known that there was a mountain range down the middle of the Atlantic Ocean. Eventually it was understood that this was part of a world-girdling range called the MidOceanic Ridge.

In 1953 the American physicists Maurice Ewing (1906—-1974) and Bruce Charles Heezen (1924 1977) discovered that a deep canyon ran the length of the ridge. It was called the Great Global Rift. There were places where the rift came quite close to land: it ran up the Red Sea between Africa and Arabia and skimmed the borders of the Pacific through the Gulf of California and up the coast of the state of California.

The rift seemed to break the Earth’s crust into plates tightly joined as though fitted together by a skilled carpenter. They were therefore called fectonic plates, from a Greek word for ““carpenter.” The study of the evolution of the Earth'’s crust in terms of these plates is called  plate tectonics, and it has totally revolutionized geology, explaining a great deal that had been mysterious before.

There are six large tectonic plates and a number of smaller ones, and it is along the boundaries of the plates that Earth’s quakes and volcanoes seem to be concentrated. One plate, which includes most of the Pacific Ocean, and with boundaries of the eastern coast of Asia and the western coast of America, ac- . counts for about 80 percent of the earthquake energy released on Earth.

1953,Bubble Chambers,"['Wilson', 'Donald Arthur Glaser', 'Glaser']",['American'],"At this time the most familiar device for detecting the paths of subatomic particles was the cloud chamber invented by Wilson (see 1911). The American physicist Donald Arthur Glaser (b. 1926) thought of reversing its principle.

In the cloud chamber, you have humid air on the point of forming small droplets of liquid. What if you started, instead, with a liquid that was on the point of boiling and forming small bubbles of vapor? In the cloud chamber, a speeding charged particle would encourage the formation of droplets, and a line of drop-

lets would mark out its path. In this new bubble chamber, a speeding charged particle would encourage the formation of bubbles, and a line of bubbles would mark out its path.

Since liquids are denser than gases, a speeding particle will slow more quickly in a bubble chamber than in a cloud chamber, curve more intensely, and reveal its properties more clearly. Then, too, there will be more collisions in the bubble chamber—more events will take place. Finally, if liquid hydrogen is used as the liquid, it will consist, for the most part, of electrons and single protons, and the simplicity of the background will make the results easier to interpret.

By 1953 Glaser had made his bubble chamber a practical reality and they have been an indispensable tool of subatomic investigations ever since. Glaser received the Nobel Prize for physics in 1960 as a result.

1953,Strange Particles,['Murray GellMann'],['American'],"Kaons and hyperons are subject to the strong interaction and are formed in ways that involve the strong interaction. It would seem that they ought to

break down by the strong interaction too, but they don't; they break down far more slowly by way of the weak interaction.

This is not to say that they break down slowly in any absolute sense—it takes just under a billionth of a second—Dbut if they broke down by way of the strong reaction, it would only take a billionth of a billionth of a second. That they break down so slowly seemed strange, and they came to be called strange particles.

In 1953 the American physicist Murray GellMann (b. 1929) tried to make sense out of this strangeness. He studied the properties of groups of two or three hadrons that differed only in the nature of their electric charge and assigned each group a kind of average electric charge.

In this way he was able to demonstrate that each group had a special property, which he called strangeness, that depended on the properties of the average clectric charge. In the most familiar hadrons, such as the proton, neutron, and pion, the strangeness number was 0 and the property was negligible. For kaons and hyperons, however, the strangeness number was not 0 but +1, -1, +2,0r — 2.

For the strange parti-

cles to break down by the strong interaction, the strangeness number would have to remain unchanged, and since all the particles they might break down into had 0 strangeness, they couldn’t break down in that way. Therefore, they were forced to break down by

the weak interaction, in which the strangeness number didn’t matter. Hence the comparatively long lifetime of the strange particles.

As a result of this and other work, Gell-Mann received the Nobel Prize for physics in 1969.

1953,Masers,"['Einstein', 'Charles Hard Townes', 'Townes', 'Aleksandr Mikhaylovich Prokhorov', 'Nikolay Gennadiyevich Basov', 'John G. Gibbon']","['American', 'Soviet', 'United States']","Einstein had pointed out that if a photon of a certain size struck a molecule, the molecule would absorb the photon and rise to a higher energy level, If such a photon struck a molecule that was already in the higher energy level, the molecule would return to the lower energy level, emitting a photon of exactly the same wavelength and moving in exactly the same direction as the striking photon, which would itself continue to move on. Now there would be two photons, which would strike two other high-level molecules, so that you would end with four. In a very brief time, there would be a vast flood

of photons, all of the same wavelength (monochromatic) and all moving in the same direction (coherent radiation).

After World War I1, when microwaves became extremely important in connection with radar and radio astronomy, the American physicist Charles Hard Townes (b. 1915) wondered if use could be made of this principle to produce a microwaye beam of great intensity.

The ammonia molecule, for instance, vibrates 24 billion times a second under appropriate conditions. This could be converted into microwaves with a wavelength of 1Y centimeters. Suppose ammonia molecules were then raised to a higher energy level through exposure to heat or electricity and exposed to a feeble beam of microwaves of the natural frequency of the ammonia molecule (1% centimeters). That should release a much stronger beam of the same wavelength.

By December 1953, Townes had a device that actually worked in this fashion. The process was described by the phrase microwave amplification by stimulated emission of radiation. Using the initials of the phrase, the instrument was referred to more briefly as a maser.

Two Soviet physicists, Aleksandr Mikhaylovich Prokhorov (b. 1916) and Nikolay Gennadiyevich Basov (b. 1922) worked out the theoretical basis of the maser independently of Townes at about the same time. As a result, all three shared in the Nobel Prize for physics in 1964.

Heart-Lung Machine

A heart-lung machine (or pump oxygenator) is one that takes venous blood from the veins, oxygenates it by mixing it with air, and pumps it back into the arteries, thus bypassing lungs and heart. It makes it possible to stop the heart and perform open-heart surgery without endangering the patient's life.

The first successful heart-lung machine, devised by John G. Gibbon of the United States, was used in 1953. Since then it has been repeatedly improved and is now used in the coronary bypass operations that are routinely performed to relieve the life-threatening agony of angina pectoris.

1954,Kidney Transplant,[],"['Medawar', 'Boston']","When a vital human organ fails, death may be prevented if another organ can be transplanted. The transplanted organ may come from a living human being who can spare it, or from a human being dead in an accident so recent that the organ is still viable.

Unfortunately, human beings are allergic to one another, and the donated organ tends to be rejected, although scientists like Medawar (see 1949) were striving to find ways of reducing this tendency.

The first successful kidney transplant took place in December 1954 in Boston, from one identical twin to another. Since identical twins have the same genetic makeup, they have

very little tendency to reject each other's organs. If one twin has two bad kidneys and the other two good ones, one of the good pair (which the donor can spare) can keep the dying twin alive. In this case, the twin that received the kidney lived on for eight years.

Many other kidney transplants have been carried through since, sometimes with considerable success, even among other than identical twins.

-1954,Controlled Fission Reactors,['Hyman George Rickover'],"['Chicago', 'Soviet Union', 'Great Britain', 'United States', 'France', 'Soviet Union American', 'American', 'Soviet Union United States']","Even before the first fission bomb had been exploded, a controlled nuclear reactor (although a very inefficient one) had been set up in Chicago in 1942. Its only function was to show that a fission bomb was possible. Efforts were later made, however, to devise nuclear reactors efficient enough to serve as reasonable sources of controlled energy for peaceful uses. The fissioning uranium or plutonium would liberate heat at a moderate rate, and this heat would turn water into steam, which would turn a turbine and produce electricity. Naturally, methods had to be devised to slow the fission reaction if it showed signs of proceeding

too quickly and producing enough heat to result in a meltdown. A controlled nuclear reactor could not explode, since it was not enclosed strongly enough to build up the kind of heat and force that would lead to an explosion. It would, however, be capable of releasing a surge of nuclear radiation into the environment, so the pressure for safe operation was therefore strong.

The first nuclear reactor built to produce electric power for civilian use was put into action in the Soviet Union in June 1954. It was a very small one. Larger reactors were produced in Great Britain and in the United States soon after, and eventually they were distributed around the globe and began to contribute substantially to the world’s energy supply, particularly in France and the Soviet Union.

Controlled reactors also came into use in another way. Submarines throughout both world wars had remained vulnerable because they had to surface periodically to recharge their batteries. Under the driving force of the Polish-born American naval officer Hyman George Rickover (1900— 1986), a plan developed to equip American submarines with atomic reactors,  which would require no recharging and could keep a submarine submerged for months at a time. The first nuclear-powered submarine, the Nautilus, was launched in January

Some nuclear-powered surface vessels were eventually built by the Soviet Union and the United States, but except for submarines, nuclear-powered forms of transportation did not catch on.

Oxytocin was a particularly simple protein hormone, its molecules made up of only eight amino acid residues arranged in a circle. Du Vigneaud went on in 1954 to synthesize oxytocin, combining just the right amino acids in the right order.

This was the first occasion on which a naturally oceurring protein was synthesized and the synthetic

protein shown to have just the same properties and abilities as the protein as it occurs in the body. For this, du Vigneaud was awarded the Nobel Prize for chemistry in 1955.

-1954,Chloroplast Isolation,"['Pelletier', 'Caventou', 'Sachs', 'Daniel Israel Arnon']",[],"Since Pelletier and Caventou had isolated chlorophyll (see 1817), it had been well known that chlorophyll was essential to photosynthesis. However, no one had been able to make chlorophyll perform the task in the test-tube.

It had been nearly a century since von Sachs had discovered that chlorophyll was present in discrete organelles, called chloroplasts, within the plant cell (see 1862). It was natural to assume that in the cell, chlorophyll worked as a catalyst, not by itself but as part of an intricate system that was present intact in the chloroplast.

This could be shown if chloroplasts could be isolated intact from the cells, and made to show that they could then carry out photosynthesis in the test-tube. But chloroplasts are so flimsy that for a long time no procedure sufficed to extract them intact.

Finally in 1954 the

Polish-American biochemist Daniel Israel Arnon (b. 1910) was able to obtain intact chloroplasts from disrupted spinach-leaf cells and demonstrate their ability to carry on photosynthesis outside the cell.

But how could DNA turn the trick? It was composed of chains of four different nucleotides, while enzymes, which were proteins, were composed of chains of twenty different amino acids,

In 1954 George Gamow (see 1929) suggested that it made no sense Lo try to line up an individual nucleotide with an individual amino

acid, since there were too few of the former and too many of the latter. He pointed out that it must be necessary to deal with combinations of at least three nucleotides. If there were four different nucleotides, they could be built up into sixty-four different trinucleotides, or codons— more than enough to carry the information necessary to build up proteins.

Gamow got the details wrong in his scheme, but he had the right idea just the same. He was the first to conceive of a multinucleotide genetic code.

"
-1954,Photovoltaic Cells,"['Selenium', 'Selenium Light']",['Eighty'],"Eighty years before, it had been discovered that the element selenium could conduct an electric current much more easily in the light than in the dark. It was eventually realized that the energy of sunlight knocked electrons loose from the selenium atoms, and it was those electrons that carried the current. Selenium came to be used for small jobs. Thus a beam of light shone across a doorway into a selenium receiver and an electric current flowed that kept a door closed against the pull of a

spring. If an approaching object interrupted the beam of light, the darkened selenium ceased conducting electricity and the door swung open. The device, popularly known as an electric eye, is more properly called a photoelectric or photovoltaic cell.

Selenium is not suitable for heavy jobs, as it is extremely inefficient, turning less than 1 percent of the energy of sunlight into electricity. In 1954, however, photovoltaic cells were devised that made use of semiconductors of the type used in transistors.

Light kicked electrons out of place much more efficiently in their case; they turned about 4 percent of the sunlight into electricity. At that level, photovoltaic cells could also be referred to as solar batteries. Photovoltaic cells continued to be improved, and eventually some with efficiencies of up to 30 percent appeared. As efficiency rose and the cost of manufacture fell, it seemed the time might come when electricity could be manufactured directly out of sunlight. If the Sun were used in that fashion, we would never

run out of the supply and there would be no chemical pollution.

Since Capek’s time, the word has come to be applied to any manufactured device, usually envisaged as humanoid in shape (though it doesn't have to be) and made of metal (though again, it doesn’t have to be), which is capable of doing work ordinarily done by human beings.

Although robots were much used in science fiction, the first patent wasn't taken out on a robotic device in real life until 1954. 1t was the work of the American inventor George C. Devol, Jr., who teamed up afterward with the American entrepreneur Joseph F. Engelberger (b. 1925), who had grown interested in robots as a result of reading /, Robot by Isaac Asimov (b. 1920).

For twenty years they continued to develop patents, but the manufacture of robots that were sufficiently cheap and compact

-1954,Bevatron,['Anderson'],"['Walton', 'California']","Since the first particle accelerator was built by Cockcroft and Walton (see 1929), the energy produced by particle accelerators had increased enormously. By 1954, a particle accelerator capable of accelerating protons to an energy of 5 to 6 billion electron volts (BeV) had been built at the University of California. It was called the Bevatron because of the energy range of the particles it produced, and indeed it could produce particles in the energy range of fairly intense cosmic rays.

This meant it was no longer necessary to wait for cosmic rays to strike atoms in the atmosphere and produce interesting results, as Anderson had had to (see 1932). The necessary bombarding particles were always there, and in any reasonable quantities. The search could proceed much more surely in the laboratory, especially since particle accelerators continued to be made ever more powerful as time went on.

The most straightforward way of doing so was abstention from sex, but that wasn't really a practical solution. The trick would be to find

a cheap and convenient way to lower the birthrate without interfering with sex.

It had been noted that there were natural ways of bringing this about, for during pregnancy and some parts of the menstrual cycle, women can safely indulge in sex without much chance, if any, of conception. It might be possible, then, to find some sort of hormone that, taken by mouth in pill form, as an oral contraceptive, would induce temporary sterility. The American biologist Gregory Goodwin Pincus (1903-1967) found such a hormone, and clinical tests in 1954 demonstrated its efficacy. Use of the Pill (as it was popularly termed) made possible sex without fear of pregnancy. This went a long way toward abolishing the double standard and encouraged the women's liberation move-

ment, with its demand that women be treated on a par with men economically.

shortcoming. Furthermore, the myth arose that men who wore glasses were effeminate and that women who wore them were ugly. (The movies, in particular, helped propagate these mischievous ideas.) For that reason, it seemed useful to correct vision in a less conspicuous way

As early as 1887, a German physician, Adelf Eugen Fick (1829-1901), had worked out the notion

of contact lenses, small lenses that would just fit over the iris of the eye, correcting vision without anyone noticing it,

Glass in direct contact with the eye, however, would be irritating and dangerous. In 1954 plastic contact lenses were produced, which proved useful and popular, and contact lenses are now in common use.

A radio source in Cygnus was unusually strong, and optical investigation of the region revealed a peculiarly shaped galaxy that looked rather like two galaxies undergoing a collision.

The Soviet astronomer Viktor Amazaspovich Ambartsumian (b. 1908) exam-

ined the nature of the radio source closely and suggested that it was really a galaxy in a state of vast explosion. That idea was borne out by later work. This was another example of what are now known as active galaxies, in which events releasing enormous energies are taking place at  the core. Whereas under optical observation, the Universe seemed to be serene and peaceful (except for the occasional novas and supernovas), radio astronomy began to show that it was

1955,Birth of Stars,['George Howard Herbig'],['American'],"The more massive a star, the brighter it is, the more rapidly it consumes its nuclear fuel, and the shorter its life on the main sequence (see 1914). The Sun came into being as a star only 4.5 billion years ago, some 10 billion years after the Universe itself came into being, and will remain on the main sequence only 5 or 6 billion years more.

Stars that are much more massive than the Sun can have lifetimes on the main sequence of less than a billion years, perhaps even only several million. Such stars that are still on the main sequence now must have been formed less than a billion years ago, or perhaps only a few million years ago. This leads to the thought that there may well be interstellar clouds out of which stars are forming right now.

For instance, there are reasons for thinking that the Orion nebula is an active star-former right now.

In 1955 the American astronomer George Howard Herbig (b. 1920) detected two stars in the Orion nebula that had not been seen a few years earlier. This means we may have witnessed the actual birth of these stars.

Scientists were quite convinced that if the antielectron existed, the antiproton had to exist also. The antiproton, however, would have a mass 1837 times that of the antielectron and therefore require 1837 times the energy to be formed.

It was not practical to wait for one of the relatively few cosmic ray particles sufficiently energetic to form an antiproton. Once the bevatron was built, however (see 1954), energies capable of forming antiprotons were available in quantity.

In 1955 Segre, who had first detected technetium (see 1937), and the American physicist Owen Chamberlain (b. 1920) bombarded copper for hours with protons possessing energies of 6.2 BeV. They worked out an elaborate system for detecting any antiprotons that might be formed, even amid large numbers of other particles of different charge and

It should be possible, in theory, then, to convert graphite into diamond. However, carbon atoms held each other so tightly that very high temperatures were required to shake them loose, and the high temperatures had to be combined with very high pressures in order to force the atoms into the more compact arrangement of diamond.

Moissan thought he had achieved the synthesis of diamond from graphite, but that proved to be a mistake. He might even have been the victim of a hoax, since he could not possibly have attained the temperatures and pressures required.

Bridgman’s work on high pressure (see 1905) made the conversion possible at last, however, and in 1955 scientists managed to attain pressures of 100,000 atmospheres and temperatures of 2,500° C. In addition, they used chromium as a catalyst. As a result, they formed synthetic diamonds (indistinguishable from the “real thing”) out of graphite. Eventually, with still higher temperatures and pressures, graphite was turned into diamond without the need for a catalyst.

Field lon Microscopes

The art of magnifying the small reached a new plateau in 1955 when the German-born American physicist Erwin Wilhelm Mueller, who had developed the field-emission microscope (see 1937), devised the field ion microscope, which emitted beams of ions rather than electrons.

This device strips positively charged helium ions off

an extremely fine, curved needle tip, kept at liquidhydrogen temperatures, and shoots them, in divergent paths, at a fluorescent screen. What appears on the screen then is a vastly magnified image (a million times or more) of the needle tip.

With such magnifications, individual atoms could be seen as dots and their arrangement studied.

Although antineutrinos scarcely interact with other particles, every once in a while one out of trillions will collide squarely with a proton, converting it to a neutron (the opposite of the change that produced the antineutrino in the first place) and liberating an antielectron (positron) as well. It was necessary to watch for the simultaneous appearance of a neutron and an antielectron, together with gamma rays of a certain energy arising after a certain interval.

In 1956 two American physicists, Frederick Reines (b. 1918) and Clyde Lorrain Cowan (b. 1919), set up the necessary detection system and snared a few antineutrinos.

Eventually, neutrinos themselves were detected in solar radiation.

Conservation of Parity Physicists had worked out

conservation laws that dictated conservation of en-

ergy, momentum, angular momentum, and electric charge, among others. In every case, this meant that the total quantity of that property in a closed system (one that did not interact with objects outside the system) could not change, no matter what happened within the system. The assumption was that such conservation laws were universal.

The study of subatomic particles showed that these conservation laws held in the subatomic realm as well. In addition, new conservation laws were discovered, such as the conservation of parity. Parity was the quality of being either odd or even. Just as in numbers, odd parity plus odd parity equaled even parity; even parity plus even parity equaled even parity; but odd parity plus even parity equaled odd parity. Each particle was assigned a particular parity, either odd or even, so that the total of all the particles in a closed system was either odd or even. No matter what happened to the particles within the system, if it began even, it ended even, and if it began odd, it ended odd. At least, so it was assumed.

Then trouble arose with kaons. Sometimes

kaons broke down to two pions, which together had even parity; and sometimes to three pions, which together had odd parity, It was concluded that there were two kinds of kaons, one with even parity and one with odd. However, no one could detect any difference between the two kinds of kaons or predict which one a particular kaon would be.

In 1956 two Chinese physicists, Yang Chen Ning (b. 1922) and Lee Tsungdao (b. 1926), suggested that there was only one kind of kaon, but that since kaons broke down through the weak interaction, and since in the weak interaction parity was not necessarily conserved, then a kaon could break down into either two or three pions indiscriminately. They pointed out that if parity was conserved in the weak interaction, then in certain particle changes, electrons would come out in equal amounts, left and right. If parity was not conserved, then electrons would come out predominantly in one direction. The experiment was performed, and the electrons came out predominantly in one direction.

This meant that although parity seemed to be conserved in the strong in teraction and the electromagnetic interaction, it was not conserved in the weak interaction. As a result, Yang and Lee received the Nobel Prize for physics in 1957.

This did not mean, by the way, that conservation of parity really broke down altogether. It might merely mean that parity had to be combined with another property for both to be conserved. For instance, if particles gave off electrons predominantly in one direction, antiparticles gave them off predominantly in the other direction. The combination was called C-P (charge conjugation and parity), so scientists decided there was a law of C-P conservation.

1956,Antineutron,['Einstein'],[],"Once the antiproton was discovered (see 1955), its properties could be studied. If it encountered a proton, the two oppositely propertied particles annihilated each other and their masses were converted into energy in accordance with Einstein’s equation (see 1905). If, however, a proton and antiproton did not actually collide but passed each other closely, they might not undergo annihilation, but the positive charge of

the proton and the negative charge of the antiproton might neutralize each other across the small gap, leaving two uncharged particles. One would be the neutron, of course, but the other, as was shown in 1956, would have to be an antineutron.

This was a puzzle. When the notion of antiparticles had been raised, the only subatomic particles known were electrically charged. The electron was negative, so the antielectron had to be positive. The proton was positive, so the antiproton had to be negative. But since the neutron was uncharged, neither positive nor negative, what could the antineutron be to make it an antineutron?

As it turned out, the neutron, while neutral overall, must have equal amounts of positive and negative electric charge distributed within. This distribution must be not quite symmetrical, so that when the neutron spins (see 1925) it develops a magnetic field pointed in a particular direction. The antineutron must have its charge distributed asymmietrically in an opposite sense, so that when it spins in the same way as the neutron, the magnetic field points in the opposite direction.

A better understanding of charge distribution within neutral particles had to await further discoveries.

1956,Continuous Maser,['Nicolaas Bloembergen'],"['Townes', 'American']","In the maser, as first developed by Townes (see 1953), the molecules were first raised to a high energy level and then allowed to drop down to a lower level, giving up the excess energy in a flash of coherent microwave radiation. There would then have to be a pause while the molecules were again raised to a higher level.

In 1956, however, the Dutch-born American physicist Nicolaas Bloembergen (b. 1920) devised a maser in which energy was on three levels rather than two, so that one of the upper levels could be storing while the other was emitting. For this continuous maser, he received a share of the Nobel Prize for physics in 1981.

1956,Temperature of Venus,"['Venus', 'Earth', 'Earth Venus', 'Venus Onee']","['American', 'Venus']","It had long been assumed that Venus, being closer to the Sun than Earth was, would be warmer than

Earth, although its thick cloud layer would probably reflect much of the Sun's radiation. Furthermore, the cloud layer seemed to imply that Venus had a great deal of water, which might further moderate the weather, so that on the whole, Venus was thought to be a quite comfortable world.

However, every object gives off microwaves; the higher the temperature of the object, the shorter the wavelength of these microwaves. Onee radio astronomy was developed, radio telescopes became delicate enough to detect microwaves being emitted by the planets.

In 1956 a team of American astronomers headed by Cornell H. Mayer studied the microwaves emitted by Venus's dark side. Their nature made it clear that something on Venus, either its surface or some layer in its atmosphere, was at a temperature far above the boiling point of water. The vision of Venus as a comfortable world was thus rudely shaken and was eventually destroyed.

1956,Ribosomes,"['George Emil Palade', 'Palade', 'Mahlon Bush Hoagland', 'Jacques-Lucien Monod', 'Francois Jacob']","['American', 'Palade', 'RNA', 'American Hoagland', 'French']","Once the electron microscope was turned upon the cell, far greater detail could

be made out than had ever been seen before (see 1932). For instance, there were numerous small bodies, which were called microsontes (small bodies), distributed through the cytoplasm of the cell. The Romanianborn American physiologist George Emil Palade (b. 1912) studied them carefully by electron microscope and found they were not merely mitochondrial fragments, as some had thought, but independent bodies with a chemical composition quite different from that of mitochondria.

By 1956 Palade had shown that microsomes were rich in RNA (ribonucleic acid), and they were therefore renamed ribosomes. It was quickly realized that the ribosomes were the site of protein manufacture within the cell.

For this work, Palade was awarded a share of the Nobel Prize for physiology and medicine in 1974.

Transfer RNA

In 1956 the American biochemist Mahlon Bush Hoagland (b. 1921) discovered relatively small molecules of RNA in the cytoplasm. These came in different varieties, and Hoagland showed that each

variety had the capacity to combine with a particular amino acid.

At the other end, the RNA molecule could combine with a particular spot on a ribosome. Once the RNA molecules were lined up properly, the amino acids at the other end of each would be lined up properly too and could easily combine to form particular proteins. Since these RNA molecules transferred the information from the ribosomes to the proteins, they were called transfer RNA.

But how did the transfer RNA manage to take up its positions to form the proper proteins? The DNA molecules in the chromosomes, which carried the information from parent to offspring, were buried deep in the cell nucleus, while the transfer RNA was in the cytoplasm.

As it happens, the nucleus contains RNA molecules also. Two French biologists, Jacques-Lucien Monod (1910-1976) and Francois Jacob (b. 1920), suggested that the information on the DNA molecule was transferred to an RNA molecule that had used one of the DNA strands as a model in its formation. These RNA molecules carried the information  (message) out into the cytoplasm and were therefore called messenger RNA.

Each transfer-RNA molecule had a threenucleotide combination at one end that fit threenucleotide combinations at certain spots on the messenger RNA. So when the messenger RNA settled on the ribosome surface, various transfer-RNA molecules lined up, trinucleotide to appropriate trinucleotide, and the amino acids on the other end combined.

Thus information was transferred from the DNA in the chromosome to the messenger RNA, which traveled out from the nucleus to the ribosomes in the cytoplasm and gave the information to the transferRNA molecules, which transferred the information to the amino acids and formed the protein

1957,Details of Photosynthesis,"['Photosynthesis', 'Melvin Calvin', 'Progress', 'Calvin']","['American', 'Calvin']","It was much harder to study photosynthesis in detail than many other reaction systems that proceed in living tissue. Photosynthesis will only work in intact chloroplasts, so that one must deal with reasonably intact living plant cells rather than with extracts or chopped-up preparations. Then, too, photosynthesis works so rapidly that it would seem almost beyond hope to see what was happening.

However, the biochemical techniques that had been developed over the past two decades made it possible. The American biochemist Melvin Calvin (b. 1911) subjected plant cells to carbon dioxide labeled with carbon-14, allowing exposure for no more than seconds before mashing and killing the cells. He then subjected the contents to paper chromatography. Substances containing carbon-14 were separated and studied.

Progress was slow, but little by little, Calvin and his group discovered and isolated the intermediate products, deduced how they must fit together, and built up a scheme of photosynthesis that made sense.

By 1957 the main strokes were filled out with detail, and Calvin was awarded the Nobel Prize for chemistry in 1961 as a result.

The Polish-American microbiologist Albert Bruce Sabin (b. 1906) thought it might be possible to find strains of polio that were too feeble to produce the disease even while alive but that would activate antibody formation and continue to do so as long as they remained

in the body. Such live strains could be taken by mouth.

When Sabin thought he had the proper strains, judging by animal experiments, he tried them first

on himself, then on prison volunteers. In 1957 the Sabin vaccine came into widespread use in the Soviet Union and eastern Europe. Three years afterward, it came into use in the United States as well.

1957,Tunnel Diode,"['Leo Esaki', 'Esaki']",['Japanese'],"The Japanese physicist Leo Esaki (b. 1925) was working with tiny crystal rectifiers (semiconductor diodes) and found, in 1957, that on occasion their resistance decreased with current intensity rather than increasing as expected. This was caused by a tunnel effect, an ability on the part of electrons to penetrate barriers that were perhaps a hundred atoms thick, as though they were tunneling through. Electrons could do this because they had their wave aspects and could be, in their particle aspect, at any part of the wave. If the wave extended for a hundred-atom thickness, the electron could hind itself, every once in a while, on the other side of an insulating barrier, even though this would have been thought impossible in classical physical theory.

The barrier-crossing electrons could be used for

switching purposes, and Esaki tunnel diodes were ultrasmall and ultrafast. For his discovery, Esaki received a share of the Nobel Prize for physics in 1973.

If boron nitride, with a molecule consisting of one atom of boron and one of nitrogen, is heated and compressed under conditions that would form diamond from graphite (see 1955), the boron nitride takes on the diamond configuration too and is then known as borazon. This trick was accomplished in 1957.

The electron arrangement in borazon is just as in diamond. The slight asymmetry resulting from the alternation of boron and nitrogen nuclei keeps borazon from being quite as hard as diamond, but borazon is the more useful at high temperatures. At 900° C diamond will burn and turn into carbon dioxide, but borazon survives unchanged.

The wavelength of the gamma ray depends in part on the extent of this recoil. Since this varies somewhat from atom to atom, the gamma rays emitted show a spread of wavelength. The German physicist Rudolf Ludwig Méssbauer (b. 1929) studied conditions under which atoms that were part of a crystal would emit a gamma ray in such a way that the recoil would be spread over all the atoms making up the

crystal. The recoil is then vanishingly slight, and the

gamma ray wavelength shows no spread due to that recoil. As a result, the crystal emits a sharply monochromatic beam ol gamma rays, and this, dis-

covered in 1938, is called the Méssbauer effect.

Gamma rays emitted in this way by one crystal will be easily absorbed by another crystal of the same type, but if the wavelength varies even slightly in either direction, absorption will not take place. For this work, Mdssbauer received a share of the Nobel Prize for physics in 1961.

The Soviet Union had placed two satellites in orbit in 1957, Sputnik I on October 4 and Sputnik II on November 3. The latter carried a dog, the first living animal to be placed into orbit.

The first successful American satellite was Explorer I, which was launched on January 31, 1958. It carried counters designed to estimate the number of charged particles in the upper atmosphere, and detected about the expected concentrations of particles at heights of up to several hundred miles, but at higher altitudes the number fell to zero. Two other satellites launched soon afterward, one by the United States and one by the Soviet Union, recorded the same phenomenon.

The American physicist James Alfred Van Allen (b. 1914) did not believe the count could really fall to zero. He felt that what happened was that the count went so high it put the counter out of action.

When Explorer IV was

launched by the United States on July 26, 1958, it carried special counters that were shielded with a thin layer of lead to keep out most of the radiation (rather like wearing sunglasses to protect the eyes). The radiation that penetrated the lead was not enough to overwhelm the counters, and now the count went up and up and up with increasing altitude —far higher than scientists had expected.

It appeared that surrounding the Earth, outside the atmosphere, there were belts containing high concentrations of charged particles that moved along the lines of force of Earth’s magnetic field. These particles approached the Earth's surface in the neighborhood of the Earth's magnetic field. There they were responsible for the aurorae and, at times of unusually high concentration, for magnetic storms that affected the compass and electronic equipment. These belts were at first called the Van Allen belts but were eventually referred to as the magnetosphere.

This was the first important discovery—an entirely unexpected one—to be made as a result of the launching of artificial satellites.

Copying by hand is slow and cumbersome, and errors inevitably arise. Carbon paper and mimeograph machines were great improvements but usually messy.

An American physicist, Chester F. Carlson (1906— 1968), strove to find a method of copying that would use dry powder, electric charge, and light. Because nothing moist is used, the procedure he found is called xerography (Greek for “dry writing""), and because light is used, it is called photocapying. It works by giving paper a positive electric charge and the powder a negative electric charge, so that the powder clings to those places where light does not pene trate and destroy the charge. In other words, the powder clings to the shadows cast by the opaque printing of the object being copied. The application of

heat fixes the powder

on the paper and the copy is produced. There is no mess and no moisture, and it can be done very quickly.

Carlson worked on the method for some twenty years and finally perfected it for office use in 1958. When he introduced the device, he called it Xerox  1959

It missed the Moon by a considerable margin and took up an independent orbit about the Sun, so that it became the first artificial planet.

On September 12, 1959, the Soviet Union launched Lunik 11, which was better aimed. It struck the Moon, and for the first time in history, an Ubjcul

It sent back the first photographs of the far side, the side never before seen by human beings. Forty minutes of photos were taken from a height of 40,000 miles above the lunar surface. The photo-

It revolved about the Earth in 2'4 hours and its orbit could be studied in great detail. Its perigee (the point of its closest approach to the Earth) moved somewhat with each revolution, in part because of the gravitational pull of the Earth's equatorial bulge upon it.

By 1959, after Van-

—

guard I had made thousands of revolutions, it was clear that the perigee was slightly more affected by the bulge south of the equator than by the bulge north of it. This meant that the Earth was a little bulgier (to the extent of about 25 feet) south of the equator than north.

The shape of the Earth was, in this way, more accurately determined than would have been possible by any reasonable Earthbound observations. This was an indication of the way we could learn more about the Earth itself by going out into space.

Occasionally, when a solar flare appeared on the solar surface, it was followed, after the lapse of some days, by a magnetic storm on Earth. Something was apparently emitted by the flares that eventually reached Earth.

The American physicist Eugene Newman Parker (b. 1927) had argued the year before that the Sun constantly emitted charged particles in every direction

and that these drifted outward through the Solar System, passing Earth. He called them the solar wind.

A solar flare might therefore be the source of an unusually large gust of such particles, which on arriving at Earth would intensify the usual effects of the solar wind.

The existence of the solar wind was verified by Lunik IT and Lunik III on their way toward the Moon in 1959, and later probes did the same.

1958,Shape of the Hemoglobin Molecule,"['Sanger', 'Insulin Structure', 'Max Ferdinand Perutz', 'Perutz', 'John Cowdery Kendrew', 'Perutz Kendrew']",['British'],"Six years earlier, Sanger had determined the exact order of the amino acids in a long protein chain (see 1952, Insulin Structure), but even that was not sufficient to describe the structure of a protein totally. The amino acid chain bent and curved and was hooked together by a variety of chemical bonds. Generally, an enzyme molecule did not work as a simple amino acid chain. It was the intricate three-dimensional folding of the amino acid chain that brought certain amino acids together and presented a surface on which

chemical reactions could take place with great ease —though they could take place only with the greatest difficulty otherwise.

The Austrian-born British biochemist Max Ferdinand Perutz (b. 1914) undertook to work out the three-dimensional structure of hemoglobin. The logical way to do this was by the study of X-ray diffraction patterns, but the patterns obtained, while sufficient to be useful in working out the structure of small molecules such as vitamin B-12 or simple chains such as the DNA double helix (see 1953), were not helpful in working out the intricacies of the protein molecule.

Perutz found, however, that if he added a single atom of a heavy metal like gold or mercury to each molecule of protein, these atoms would strongly diffract X rays. The resultant pattern was sufficiently pronounced to give better hints to molecular structure.

By 1959 he had worked out the three-dimensional position of every atom in the hemoglobin molecule. His student, the British biochemist John Cowdery Kendrew (b. 1917), did the same for the similar but somewhat simpler mole-

cule of myoglobin some time later.

Before that there were various species of the genus Australopithecus (see 4,000,000 B.C.).

The australopithecines, whose existence seems to have overlapped that of Homo erectus, were hominids in that they more closely resembled human beings than they resembled any ape, living or extinct. Nevertheless, they were sufficiently primitive to be kept out of genus Homo. Did they develop directly into Homo erectus, or was there an intermediate form?

The British anthropologist Louis Seymour Bazett Leakey (1903-1972), together with his wife, Mary, carefully explored the Olduvai Gorge in what is now Tanzania. There, on July

17, 1959, they came across the first fragments of a skull that, when pieced together, seemed to be a relic of the earliest known representative of genus Homo, a species that came into existence nearly 2 million years ago. This species, intermediate between the australopithecines and Homo erectus, was eventually named Homo habilis (handy human). Homo habilis seemed to be the first hominid capable of shaping stone tools. Until then, all tools of earlier hominids, and of nonhominids for that matter, had been such things as leaves, twigs, shells, bones, and unmodified stones.

Cloud chambers could be set for desired events only, but were insufficiently sensitive to show the newer particles. Something was needed that would be selec-

tive as cloud chambers and as sensitive as bubble chambers.

This need was met by the spark chamber, in which incoming particles ionized neon gas that was crossed by many metal plates. The ions then conducted an electric current that showed up as a visible line of sparks, marking the passage of the particles. The device could be adjusted to react only to those particles that were under study.

The first practical spark chamber was constructed in 1959 by two Japanese physicists, Saburo Fukui and Shotaro Miyamoto.

Furthermore, in the retina of the eye there are three types of cells, one to react with each of the three basic colors.

In 1959, however, Land, who had invented Polaroid and the Land camera (see 1932), advanced a new theory of color vision. He  maintained that only two different wavelengths of light are needed, and that they don't even have to be very sharp. One light could be ordinary white light

with an average wavelength in the yellow-green. This would serve as the short-wave light. Red lig would serve as the longwave light. Thus, red and

white in combination could present the full color range Land produced a svstem of color photography based on this theory that reduced the

This had been pointed out by Townes (sec 1953).

The first maserlike device capable of producing an intense, coherent, monochromatic beam of visible light was constructed in May 1960 by the American physicist Theodore Harold Maiman (b. 1927), making

use of the three-level principle worked out by Bloembergen (see 1956)

Maiman designed a ruby cylinder with its ends carefully polished flat and

1960,Proof of General Relativity,[],['Einstein'],"The general theory of relativity, first advanced by Einstein (see 1916), had been confirmed in three ways, all of them astronomic and all of them very borderline: (1) the advance of Mercury's perihelion (see 1846), (2) the bending of light in a gravitational field (see 1919), and (3) the reddening of light in a gravitational field (see 1925).

Now, thanks to the Méssbauer effect (see 1958), it was possible to test general relativity in the laboratory. Suppose a beam of monochromatic gamma rays were shot down a shaft from the top of a building to the bottom. The Earth’s gravitational field would be very slightly stronger at the bottom of the building than at the top, since the bottom is nearer the Earth’s center.

This strengthening of the gravitational field would serve to increase the wavelength of the gamma rays, according to general relativity. The strengthening of the field and consequent increase in wavelength would be almost immeasurably small but large enough to cause the absorption of the gamma rays by a crystal at the bottom of the shaft to decrease considerably.

This experiment, when conducted in 1960, proved to support general relativity (as have all experiments and observations since that time).

1960,Standard Meter,"['Measures', 'Circuits Transistors']","['Paris', 'Weights']","When the metric system was first established (see 1790), the basic standard of length (the meter) was set as 1/10,000,000 the distance from the equator to the North Pole. This distance could not be established with sufficient accuracy, however, so the standard meter was defined as the distance between two scratches on a rust-resistant platinum and iridium bar, which was kept in an air-conditioned vault in a Paris suburb, where it was immune to change with temperature alterations. By 1960, however, scientific advance made it possible to turn to something

far more constant. The General Conference of Weights and Measures set the standard meter equal to 1,650,763.73 wavelengths of one of the spectral lines of an isotope of the rare gas krypton. This gave the meter a thousand times the precision of the platinumiridium bar,

Integrated o Circuits Transistors had been in existence fora dozen years (see 1948), constantly being made smaller and more reliable. By 1960 they could be made so small that it made no sense to try to handle them as separate units.

Instead, small pieces of thin silicon or some other semiconductor, about a quarter-inch square, were etched with tiny transistor circuits. These chips did the work of many transistors and were called integrated circuits.

The use of integrated circuits made computers smaller, cheaper, and more versatile. As time went on, more and more circuits— eventually thousands— could be etched into a single chip.

1960,Resonance Particles,"['Luis Walter Alvarez', 'Kaons', 'Alvarez', 'Wegener', 'Harry Hammond Hess']","['American', 'Hyperons', 'American American', 'South American', 'Eurasian', 'African']","The bubble chamber (see 1953) was excellent at detecting ultra-short-lived particles. The American physicist Luis Walter Alvarez (1911-1988) constructed huge bubble chambers and, beginning in 1960, detected particles that existed for only a few trillionths of a trillionth of a second before breaking down. The tracks they left in this incredibly short lifetime, even if they moved at the speed of light, were too small to detect directly. The existence of these socalled resonance particles could only be deduced from the nature of their longer-lived breakdown products.

The resonance particles, all hadrons (see 1952, Kaons and Hyperons), came to be discovered in great numbers until something like 150 had been found. It seemed impossible for so many different particles to exist separately, so the search was on for still simpler and far fewer particles that, in different combinations, might make up all these resonance particles.

For this work, Alvarez was awarded the Nobel Prize for physics in 1968.

Sea-Floor Spreading

Once it was understood that the Earth's crust was divided up into a few large plates and some smaller ones, it seemed unlikely that the plates retained their position forever. Although Wegener's theory of continental drift (see 1912) seemed quite impossible, since the continents could not plow their way through the underlying rock, the similarity between the opposite coasts of the Atlantic Ocean might be accounted for in other ways.

In 1960 the American geophysicist Harry Hammond Hess (1906-1969) decided it was quite possible that molten magma from the mantle might ooze upward through the Great Global Rift (see 1953). That might force the North American and South American plates farther westward while the Eurasian and African plates were forced further eastward.

The Atlantic ocean would thus widen, in what came to be called sea-floor spreading, but its coasts would retain their shape from the time the continents were in contact.

Continental drift, then, was not the result of continents slowly floating on the

underlying rock, as Wegener had thought. The continents were firmly fixed to the plates and could not move through them. But the plates themselves were forced apart in some places and forced together in others. Actual evidence for this new view was not long in coming.

In November Tiros 11 was launched, and in ten weeks it sent down over 20,000 photographs of vast stretches of Earth and its cloud cover. It took photos of a cyclone in New Zealand and of a patch of clouds in Oklahoma that was apparently spawning tornadoes.

These and other weather satellites that followed became indispensable in tracking hurricanes and other violent storms and in helping to predict weather. Innumerable lives must have been saved and enormous property damage avoided because of timely warnings of the approach of hurricanes (though they

remain potentially dangerous and devastating even 50). Such things must be considered when people argue that space exploration is only a matter of pyramid-building designed to appease national vanity and scientists’ curiosity.

He found that the phosphate group was attached to the rest of the molecule in two different places rather than one. A ring of atoms was thus formed, and Sutherland called it eyclic-AMP.

Cyclic-AMP has a profound effect on the course of metabolism within a

Microwave Reflections from Venus

Fifteen years before, microwaves had been reflected from the Moon. That had been comparatively easy. By 1961 the technique had

advanced to the point where microwaves could be sent out to Venus, a hundred times as far away as the Moon. This was done, and reflections were received by five different groups, one Soviet, one British, and three American.

The microwaves traveled through space at the speed of light, and from the time measured between the emission of the original beam and the detection of the veflection, the distance of Venus and therefore the general scale of the Solar System could be determined much more accurately than had been possible from observations of the asteroid Eros (see 1941).

By 1961 its orbit had been followed so carefully that the Belgian physicist Marcel Nicolet could calculate the drag of the

thin wisps of atmosphere present at the heights through which the satellite was moving. The large volume of the satellite and its comparative lightness magnified that drag so that it was possible to deduce the density of the air ata height of from 200 to 600 miles above Earth's surface and to show that it consisted largely of helium. This region was known as the heliosphere.

Above it was a still more rarefied region consisting chiefly of hydrogen (the protonosphere). This was thought to continue thinning out for 40,000 miles before dwindling into the general density of the gases in interplanetary space.

1960,Quarks,"[""Yuval Ne'emen"", 'James Joyce']",['Israeli'],"In 1961 Gell-Mann, who had advanced an explanation of strange particles (see 1953), worked out a method for bringing order to the numerous hadrons that were being discovered. He grouped them into families in which certain particle properties increased in value in a regu lar fashion and called it, whimsically, the Eightfold Way, with reference to certain Buddhist teachings. In doing so, he found that certain family groups had missing members, which he believed represented hadrons that had not yet been detected—much as Mende-

leyev had predicted the existence of undiscovered elements from gaps in his periodic table (see 1869).

Independently, an Israeli physicist, Yuval Ne'emen (b. 1925), worked up similar groupings at about the same time.

In order to explain the

existence of the families, Gell-Mann postulated the existence of unusual particles that he called guarks (from a phrase in Finnegans Wake by James Joyce). There were but a few of these quarks, each accompanied by an antiquark, and by grouping them in  different combinations, either two or three at a time, the various hadrons could

be accounted for.

The most startling thing about these quarks was that, if they were to produce hadrons properly, they had to have fractional electric charges. Some had charges of plus or minus '3 or %. The notion of fractional charges was hard to take, but the quark theory explained so much that it was accepted perforce and earned for Gell-Mann the Nobel Prize for physics in 1969.

1960,The Genetic Code,"['Marshall Warren Nirenberg', 'Nirenberg', 'Har Gobind Khorana']","['American', 'Ochoa', 'Nirenberg']","With the transition of genetic information from DNA to messenger RNA to transfer RNA to protein now well established (see 1956), the most important unanswered question was which trinucleotide corresponded to which amino acid. Without knowing that, one couldn’t understand how information passed from DNA to proteins.

The American biochemist Marshall Warren Nirenberg (b. 1927) took the first step toward elucidating the problem. He made use of the enzyme discovered by Ochoa (see 1955) to form an RNA molecule out of a mixture that consisted of uridylic acid only. The RNA molecule that resulted was not one that existed naturally but a synthetic, polyuridylic acid (—U—U—U—U —U—), made up of a chain of uracil nucleotides only. The only possible trinucleotide in such an RNA molecule would be U—u—u.

When Nirenberg used polyuridylic acid as messenger RNA, it worked. Transfer-RNA molecules settled upon it and amino acids combined to form a

protein. The protein was made up only of the amino acid phenylalanine.

This made it quite clear that the trinucleotide U—U—U was equivalent to the amino acid phenylalanine. Similar tactics revealed the equivalence of other trinucleotides to other amino acids until the entire genetic code was worked out.

As a result, a share of the Nobel Prize for medicine and physiology was awarded to Nirenberg in 1968. Of the two others who shared the prize, one was the Indian-born American chemist Har Gobind Khorana (b. 1922), who also did important work in elucidating the code.

cells had gene regulators that worked in different ways.

On July 10, 1962, the United States launched Telstar I. It was a true communications satellite since it not only received radio waves but amplified them before sending them on. Thanks to Telstar I and to the numerous communications satellites that fol-

1960,Venus Probe,"['Venus', 'Mariner']","['United States', 'Venus']","In the first five years of the Space Age, the Earth and the Moon had been the only targets. In 1962 the age of planetary probes—rockets designed to pass near other planets and send back information concerning them— was reached.

The first successful planetary probe was Mariner 2, launched by the United States on August 27, 1962. It was designed to approach the planet Venus, which comes closer to Earth than any other planet. Mariner 2 was therefore a Venus probe, and it passed within 22,000 miles of Venus's cloud layer on December 14, 1962.

In the course of its trip, Mariner 2 sent back irrefutable evidence of the existence of a solar wind (see 1959). 1t also detected the microwave radiation of the planet and showed defi-

nitely that its surface temperature was something like 475° C, hot enough to melt tin and lead and to boil mercury.

1960,Rotation of Venus,"['Venus', 'Earth', 'Venus Roland L. Carpenter', 'Richard M.

This was ironic, since the periods of rotation of other planets, even that of far distant Pluto (see 1955), were known. The reason for this was that Venus'’s thick and featureless cloud layer precluded any pessibility of seeing its surface and detecting features that could be spotted as moving around the planet.

Yet although light waves could not penetrate the clouds, microwaves could. Furthermore, if a beam of microwaves is reflected from an object moving at right angles to the beam (as would be true of Venus if it were rotating), then the wavelength of the beam is broadened and distorted. From the extent of the distortion, the speed of

rotational motion can be calculated.

In 1962 the American astronomers Roland L. Carpenter and Richard M. Goldstein were able to show that Venus had the astonishingly slow period of about 250 days. (The figure was later refined to 243.09 days.) What's more, Venus rotated in retrograde fashion, from east to west rather than from west to east as Earth and other bodies in the Solar System do. The reason why this is so is still not clear.

1960,Noble Gas Compounds,"['Linus Pauling', 'Neil Bartlett']",[],"Since the inert gases—helium, neon, argon, krypton, xenon, and radon—had been discovered, over half a century before, they had appeared to be truly inert, since their atoms would form bonds with no other atoms. This made increasing sense when their electronic structure was worked out, since in all cases their outermost electron shell was full so that they had no tendency to gain, lose, or share electrons.

This tendency was not absolute, however. Linus Pauling (see 1931) had pointed out that the inert gas atoms grew less inert as

their atomic number increased, so that those with higher atomic numbers might be induced to form a bond with fluorine, which was the most active of all elements and the most apt to snatch an electron from unlikely places.

In 1962 the Britishborn Canadian chemist Neil Bartlett (b. 1932) found that a compound, platinum fluoride, was almost as active as fluorine itself and easier to work with. He immersed it in xenon gas and the two substances combined to form xenon fluoroplatinate. This was the first known case of an inert gas atom forming a bond with any other atom or group of atoms.

Thereafter, other compounds involving fluorine or oxygen were formed, not only with xenon but with radon and krypton. The smaller inert gas molecules —argon, neon, and helium —remained inert, however.

As a result, chemists no longer liked to use the term inert gases, preferring noble gases as less likely to signify absolute inertness. Compounds such as xenon fluoroplatinate are therefore now referred to as noble gas compounds.

1963,Approaching Absolute Zero,"['Giauque', 'Heinz London']",[],"After Giauque had introduced his technique for attaining very low temperatures (see 1925), temperatures as low as 1/50,000 of a degree above absolute zero had been reached. That was not yet the ultimate, of course. Absolute zero can never be truly attained but it can be approached ever more closely as new techniques are developed.

In 1962 the Germanborn British physicist Heinz London (1907—-1970) used a mixture of the two helium isotopes helium-4 and helium-3 for the purpose. Ordinarily they mix perfectly, but at temperatures below 0.8°, they separate. Processes that allowed the two isotopes to mix and then separate repeatedly offered a powerful new way of cooling. Thanks to this and to other techniques involving helium-3 and nuclear magnetic properties, temperatures of 1/1,000,000 of a degree above absolute zero have been attained.

Light-Emitting Diodes

Light-emitting diodes are semiconductor devices (see 1948) that emit visible light  as their electrons drop from a higher energy level toa lower one. The first practical device of this sort was produced in 1962.

Such diodes are now routinely used where light needs merely to be seen and not to illuminate. Thus, lightemitting diodes are used bin digital clocks, in pocket computers, in elevator floor indicators, in taxi meters, and as signals in electronic equipment generally.

small areas. These compact sources were known as 3C48, 3C147, 3C196, 3C273, and 3C286. The 3C is short for Third Cambridge Catalog of Radio Stars, a listing

compiled by the British astronomer Martin Ryle (1918-1984).

In 1960 these sources

were pinpointed, by such

>n as the /  tronomer Allan Rex Sandage (b. 1926) and the Australian astronomer Cyril Hazard, and found to originate in certain objects that looked like dim stars, It seemed strange that dim stars would be such strong radio sources, and the feeling arose that they might be something other than stars. They were referred to eventually as quasistellar radio sources, where quasistellar means “'starlike,” and this was eventually shortened to quasars.

The spectra of quasars proved puzzling; the lines could not be identified. In 1963, however, the Dutchborn American astronomer Maarten Schmidt (b. 1929) realized that the lines could be identified if they were viewed as lines that would ordinarily be in the ultraviolet but had been displaced by means of an enormous red-shift.

Such a red-shift would mean that the quasars were enormously distant, over a billion light-years away, and the fact that they could be seen at all at such a distance meant they were unusual indeed. It was finally decided that they were galaxies with extremely active centers (like particularly large Seyfert galaxies—see 1943). At their distances, only the centers could be

seen, so that they had a starlike appearance. Some quasars have been detected that appear to be over 12 billion light-years away.

They can only be studied by rockets, carrying appropriate instruments, that are sent up beyond the atmosphere.

Thus, X rays from astronomical objects are completely absorbed by the atmosphere and cannot be observed from Earth’s sur-

face. Rocketry, however, had made it possible to detect X rays in the solar radiation.

Still more interesting news came in 1963, when Bruno Rossi, who had done important work on cosmic rays, began to use rockets to observe whether solar X rays were reflected from the Moon. He did not succeed in detecting such radiation. However, he did detect it emerging from the Crab nebula and also from another supernova remnant in the constellation of Scorpio.

As rocket observation became more common and more sophisticated, many other X-ray sources beyond the Solar System were located.

1963,Hydroxyls in Space,"['Trumpler', 'Hulst', 'Purcell', 'Helium']",['Earth'],"Trumpler had shown that there were thin wisps of matter in interstellar space (see 1930), and van de Hulst and Purcell had shown that hydrogen atoms were strewn across space (see 1944 and 1951).

It was reasonable to suppose that all this interstellar gas consisted of single atoms, since they would be spread out so thinly that the chances of collision

would probably be too small to allow them to combine.

Yet suppose there were collisions. The three most common atoms are hydrogen, helium, and oxygen. Helium atoms don’t combine with other atoms, but two hydrogen atoms might combine to form a hydrogen molecule, and a hydrogen and an oxygen atom might combine to form a hydroxyl group.

On Earth, a hydroxyl group is so active that it quickly combines with other atoms. The result is that such a group does not exist in the free state on Earth. In space, however, the chances of a hydroxyl group striking anything are so small that it might accumulate uncombined.

If so, hydroxyl groups ought to emit microwaves of characteristic wavelengths, and in 1963 two of those wavelengths were detected, indicating the presence of hydroxyl groups in interplanetary space.

This was ignored at first, but slowly it came to be realized that the Earth’s magnetic field strengthened and weakened. The weakening might go all the way to zero and then begin to strengthen in the opposite direction. It might be, then, that magnetic reversals occurred at intervals in Earth'’s history.

If the Atlantic Ocean's floor had spread with the upwelling of magma in the Global Rift (see 1960), then the sediments laid down on the sea bottom ought to exist in strips. If magnetic reversals had occurred, these strips ought to reflect them.

On investigation, this turned out to be the case. On either side of the rift were sediments with normal magnetization, farther away on either side were sediments with reversed magnetization, then nor-

mal again, then reversed, and so on, quite symmetrically on either side.

This offered the best evidence so far for the existence of sea-floor spreading, and also for the periodic reversal, at irregular intervals, of the magnetic field.

Of course, if two adjoining plates are pushed apart, two adjoining plates in some other part of the Earth must be pushed together. Thus the study of plate tectonics finally made sense out of mountainbuilding, volcanoes and earthquakes, the development of ocean deeps and island arcs. In short, plate tectonics became the central dogma of geology, as evolution is of biology, the atomic theory is of chemistry, and the conservation laws are of physics.

They made use of a big horn-shaped antenna originally built to detect radio reflections from the Echo satellite (see 1961).

In May 1964 they found an excess of radio-wave emission that they could not explain. When they had accounted for all possible sources of error (including

teris-

pigeon droppings inside the antenna), they found that there was a distinct background microwave radiation, coming from all directions with equal intensity.

They turned to the American physicist Robert Henry Dicke (b. 1916), who remembered that Gamow had predicted such background radiation would occur as a consequence of the bang (see 1948)

The background radiation was characteristic of a universe with an average temperature of 3 degrees above absolute zero, and it could be assumed that the Universe had cooled to that average temperature from that prevailing at the moment of the big bang. The background radiation, as a

fossil remnant (so to speak) of the big bang, finally established that event as the very likely mechanism whereby the Universe came into being.

For this discovery, Penzias and Wilson received a share of the Nobel Prize for physics in 1978.

Omega-Minus Particle

Gell-Mann had suggested the Eightfold Way as a means of ordering hadrons into groups (see 1961). In one of the groups he had set up was an empty spot that ought to hold a particle with a particular set of properties if his method of arrangement was valid. Included in those properties  was a strangeness number of —2, something no known particle had.

In 1964 a particle was found with precisely the characteristics that GellMann had predicted, including the strangeness number of —2. This had much the impact of the discovery of the missing elements whose characteristics Mendeleyev had predicted (see 1869). From that moment, the quark theory had to be taken very seriously indeed.

CPT Symmetry

parity was unbalanced in one direction in a particular particle, charge conjugation would be unbalanced in the other, and the two together would be conserved.

This was called CP (charge-parity) conservation. But in 1964 two American physicists, Val Logsden Fitch (b. 1923) and James Watson Cronin (b. 1931), found that CP was not al-

ways conserved either. Neutral kaons (see 1952) in their decay, on rare occasions violated CP conservation. In order to keep the symmetry, time (T) had to be added. Where CP was asymimetric in one direction, T was asymmetric in the other, and the combination retained symmetry. Physicists now speak of CPT symmetry. Cronin and Fitch shared the Nobel Prize for physics in 1980.

1964,Transfer-RNA Structure,"['Robert William Holley', 'Sanger', 'Holley']",['American'],"Transfer-RNA molecules, which act as intermediates between the nucleotide chain in messenger RNA and the amino acid chain in proteins (see 1956), are relatively small.

In 1964 the molecule of alanine-transfer RNA (the particular transfer RNA that attaches itself to the amino acid alanine) was completely analyzed by a team headed by the American biochemist Robert William Holley (b. 1922). As Sanger had worked with insulin (see 1952), so Holley worked with transfer RNA, breaking it down to fragments, identifying the fragments, and working out how they fit together. The

alanine-transfer-RNA molecule turned out to be made up of a chain of seventyseven nucleotides.

The chains of this transfer-RNA molecule, and others that were analyzed later, seemed to form three lobes, rather like a threeleaf clover. For this work, Holley received a share of the Nobel Prize for medicine and physiology in 1968.

This had begun to seem doubtful, since if it were true, the side of Mercury

facing away from the Sun should be extremely cold. Microwaves detected from the dark side of Mercury in 1962 had indicated that it was considerably warmer than would be expected if it were eternally dark.

In 1965 two American electrical engineers, Rolf Buchanan Dyce (b. 1929) and Gordon H. Pettengill, working with microwave reflections from the Mercurian surface, were able to show that it turned on its axis in about 59 days, despite the fact that it revolved about the Sun in 88 days. This meant that every portion of the planet received sunlight at one time or another.

Eventually, the rotation was found to be 58.65  days, just two-thirds of the period of revolution, so that Mercury showed the same side to Earth every second revolution.

However, the Earth is 4,500 million years old. This meant that the first seven-eighths of Earth’s history seemed to show no signs of life. This seemed unlikely, since the earliest fossils were already well developed and quite specialized forms of life that could not have come into existence without a long evolutionary history. The trouble was, though, that prior to the Cambrian era, organisms had not yet developed shells and other hard parts, and softer tissues do not fossilize easily. In 1965, however, the American paleontologist Elso Sterrenberg Barghoorn (1913-1984) worked with tiny bits of carbonized material in very ancient rocks and showed that they might represent bacteria living in the early eons of Earth’s history. When these bits of material were eventually studied by electron microscope, they showed

themselves unmistakably to be microfossils, or remnants of simple cells. Some were found in rocks as old as 3,500 million years.

Then, in Great Britain, the British astronomer Anthony Hewish (b. 1924) supervised the construction of a device with 2,048 separate receivers spread out in an array that covered an area of nearly 3 acres. This was designed to detect brief changes in microwave intensities.

In July 1967 the array was put to work, and within a month a graduate student, Jocelyn Bell, had detected bursts of microwaves from a place midway between Vega and Altair. The bursts were astonishingly brief, lasting only a thirtieth of a second. Even more astonishing, they followed one another with remarkable regularity—at intervals that were finally measured as 1.33730109 seconds.

That atmosphere is about 96.6 percent carbon dioxide, and virtually all the rest is nitrogen.

A plant twig, for instance, can be grafted to the branch of another tree, even when the other tree is of another species. The twig may well grow and flourish there, and such a twig is called a clone, from the Greek word for “twig.”

Simple animals, not too specialized, can regenerate an entire organism from a relative scrap.

a

Sponges, fresh-water hydras, flatworms, and starfish are all noted for this. The new organisms may also be called clones, by analogy.

Among vertebrates, cloning does not occur spontaneously. Suppose, though, that the nucleus of a living skin cell of one individual is placed into an ovum of another individual, the ovum's own nucleus having been removed. The chromosomes of the skin cell may then replicate and produce new cells with the genetic equipment of the introduced skin cell. The ovum may thus produce an organism, not of its own original species but of the species from which the skin cell was taken. This, too, would be a clone.

The technique of replacing one cell nucleus with another is tricky. It had first been successfully carried through fifteen years earlier by the American biologists Robert William Briggs (b. 1911) and Thomas J. Ki

In 1967 the British biologist John B. Gurden applied this technique of a nuclear transplantation to transferring a cell from the intestine of a South African clawed frog to an egg cell of another individual of the same species. From that ovum, with its alien nucleus, a normal new individual developed—a clone of the one from which the nucleus was taken. This was the first clone produced of a vertebrate.

Amphibian ova are naked and unprotected, however. The ova of reptiles and birds are protected by shells, and the ova of mammals remain within the body. These require much more complicated techniques, and such cloning has not vet been achieved.

1968,Electroweak Interaction,"['Einstein', 'Steven Weinberg', 'Sheldon Lee Glashow', 'Abdus Salam', 'Glashow', 'Salam']","['American', 'Pakistani', 'Weinberg']","There are four known particle interactions: strong, weak, electromagnetic, and gravitational. These seem to account for all the events taking place in the observable universe, and they are completely different from one another. The electromagnetic and gravitational interactions are both longrange fields, with the electromagnetic enormously the stronger of the two. However, the electromagnetic interaction exhibits both attraction and repulsion, and these two properties tend to balance each other. The gravitational interaction, on the other hand, exhibits attraction only; it dominates the Universe as a whole, while the electromagnetic interaction dominates atomic and molecular structure.

The strong and the weak interactions are both short-range fields, making themselves felt only across nuclear distances, with the strong interaction much the stronger (as the name implies). The gravitational interaction affects all parti-

———__—A

cles with mass, while the electromagnetic interaction affects only electrically charged particles, the strong interaction affects only hadrons, and the weak interaction is most prominent in connection with leptons.

The question arose among physicists of why there should be four different interactions. Was there not, perhaps, some way of showing that all four were but different aspects of one basic interaction, just as ice, water, and steam, despite their differences in properties, are nevertheless all aspects of the same “water substance’’?

Einstein had tried to find a mathematical treatment that could cover both gravitational and electromagnetic interactions (at a time when the strong and weak interactions had not yet been discovered) and had failed.

In 1968, however, three men, the American physicists Steven Weinberg (b. 1933) and Sheldon Lee Glashow (b. 1932) and the Pakistani physicist Abdus Salam (b. 1926), independently worked out a mathematical treatment that included both the electro-

magnetic and weak interactions. Careful observations bore out the theory and showed that the two are, indeed, a single interaction at high enough temperatures, It is only as the temperature drops that the two aspects separate (as dropping temperature causes steam to liquefy to water, and then freeze to ice, with all three capable of existing simultaneously at appropriate temperatures and pressures).

As a result of this working out of what is called the electroweak interaction, Weinberg, Glashow, and Salam shared the Nobel Prize for physics in 1979.

1968,Solar Neutrinos,"['Neutrinos', 'Frederick Reines', 'Cowan']",['South Dakota'],"Neutrinos had been detected but only in the form of antineutrinos produced by nuclear fission reactors (see 1956). The existence of antineutrinos made the existence of neutrinos themselves certain; still it would be useful to detect them directly.

The Sun produces its energy by the fusion of hydrogen to helium (see 1929). In the process, vast quantities of neutrinos are  produced, some of which reach the Earth and a few of which would interact, under appropriate conditions, with detecting devices. This would prove their existence.

Frederick Reines, who with Cowan had first detected the antineutrino, now tried to detect neutrinos from the Sun. For the purpose, he set up a huge tank containing 100,000 gallons of tetrachlorethylene in a deep mine in South Dakota. There was enough rock and earth above the tank to absorb all radiation from the sky other than neutrinos. The tank was then exposed to neutrinos from the Sun for several months. Each neutrino that was absorbed by achlorine atom in the tetracholorethylene would be converted to an argon atom, which could eventually be flushed out with helium.

By 1968 evidence of the existence of solar neutrinos was definitely obtained, but there were not enough of them. Calculations seemed to show that the Sun was actually producing, at most, only one-third of the neutrinos that it ought to be producing if current theories of nuclear activity at the Sun’s core were correct. This mystery of the missing neutrinos has concerned as-

tronomers ever since.

1968,Astrochemistry,[],[],"When the hydroxyl group had been detected in interstellar gas clouds (see 1963), astronomers had been surprised. It seemed odd that enough individual atoms would strike each other and cling, forming two-atom combinations like the hydroxyl group, to be detectable at astronomic distances. It was thought there would be virtually no chance for combinations of three or more atoms.

The increasing ability to detect microwave radiation with great precision, however, led to further surprises. In 1968 microwave frequencies characteristic of water molecules (with three atoms each) and ammonia molecules (with four atoms each) were detected in interstellar gas clouds. This was the beginning of what came to be called astrochemistry. Since then, more and more complicated atom groupings have been detected, some involving as many as thirteen atoms.

All but the very simplest are composed of chains of carbon atoms, which once again points up the uniqueness of the carbon atom as a component of complex groupings, and therefore of life as we know it.

1969,Rotating Neutron Stars,"['Pulsars', 'Thomas Gold', 'Neutron']",[],"Pulsars had been discovered (see 1967), and now the problem was to explain what produced pulsations in the range of seconds. Something had to be revolving, rotating, or pulsating at that rate, and nothing could be doing so that quickly on a cosmic scale unless it was simultaneously very small and very massive.

In 1968 Thomas Gold (b. 1920) suggested that pulsars were neutron stars (whose existence had been suggested by Zwicky—see 1934) and that they were rotating. Neutron stars, which could be as massive as ordinary stars but would be only some 14 kilometers or so across, wotuld be composed of packed neutrons, They would have enormously intense magnetic fields, so that charged particles would be emitted only at the magnetic poles, and they would give off radiation as they followed curved paths. The beam of radiation would sweep past us once each revolution, and the revolution would take place in seconds.

If this were so, the pulsars wotld be losing substantial amounts of energy as they turned, and their pe riods of rotation (and therefore the frequency of their pulsations) should slowly be lengthening. Close observation showed that this was indeed the case, and the identification of pulsars as rotating neutron stars

was accepted.

However, small light pulses are not as easily detected as microwave pulses are, and light, being more energetic, would not be given off in the intensities of microwaves.

1t made sense, then, to look in places where neutron stars might have formed comparatively recently, since they would be particularly energetic. In particular, the Crab nebula was a good possibility. The light of its supernova explosion had reached Earth only a little over nine centu-

ries previously (see 1054 and 1848), and the pulsar at its center had the shortest period of rotation (‘50 of a second) then known. That meant it was energy-rich. In January 1969, sure enough, a star near the center of the Crab nebula was found to be blinking on and off thirty times a second, in time to the microwave pulses. It was the first optical pulsar to be detected. The Crab nebula pulsar was found to be emitting pulses of X rays as well.

1969,Antarctic Meteorites,"['Earth', 'Mars']",['Japanese'],"One of the difficulties in studying meteorites is identifying them in the first place. A lump of nickel-iron that has clearly not been the result of metallurgical smelting can only be a meteorite. However, less than 10 percent of the meteorites that reach Earth are of nickel-iron, and many of those that fell in the past were collected by people who made use of iron, so that no iron meteorites are to be found at all in those areas where civilization has existed the longest.

The majority of meteorites, however, are stony in nature and not to be distinguished from ordinary rocks without careful analy-

sis. Since one can't go about analyzing every rock, stony meteorites are not recognized unless they are actually seen to fall or unless they land in areas where surface rocks do not occur.

The ideal place for a stony meteorite to land and be at once detected is on an extensive ice cap. There, any rock sitting on top of an icy thickness of a mile or more must be a meteorite. Such objects are most likely to be found on the vast Antarctic ice cap, by far the largest in the world.

In 1969 a group of Japanese geologists came across nine closely spaced meteorites on the Antarctic ice cap. These roused the interest of scientists generally, and thousands of meteoric fragments have been found since, which have made it possible to study the subject in greater detail. There is some reason to believe, from delicate chemical analyses, that a few fragments may have reached us from the Moon and some perhaps even from Mars.

(Antibodies react with particular foreign proteins, so that they are essential to the body's immune mechanism.) For this, Edelman received a share of the Nobel Prize for physiology and medicine in 1972.

1969,Artificial Hearts,['Denton Cooley'],['American'],"In comparison with most living organs, the heart is simple. It is primarily a pump designed to push the blood through the vessels of

The first attempt to place such an artificial heart inside a human being was made in 1969.

1970,Coronary Bypass,[],[],"The heart receives blood from the coronary arteries, which branch off from the aorta near the point where the aorta leaves the heart. In other words, the very first share of the blood, as it emerges from the heart on its way to the body generally, is fed to the heart itself. There seems justice here, since the heart’s labor on behalf of the body is both enormous and essential.

Unfortunately, the coronary arteries have a tendency to accumulate rough plaques on their inner surface, plaques that are rich

in cholesterol. (This is particularly true when people eat too much of a cholesterol-rich diet.) These plaques narrow the bore of the arteries and allow less blood to reach the heart. The roughness also increases the likelihood of clot formation, which may stop the blood flow altogether.

Starving the heart of blood causes the severe pains of angina pectoris, and of course any serious stoppage causes a heart attack and death. A perfectly healthy heart can be immobilized because of such coronary mishaps.

In 1969 a surgical technique was developed of using veins or sometimes arteries from the patient’s own body to lead the blood around the clogged portions of the coronaries, renewing the heart’s blood supply. If more than one such portion is bypassed, we speak of a double bypass, a triple bypass, and S0 on.

Since 1969 coronary bypass operations have become extremely common, and while they do not necessarily lengthen life, they make what remains of it much more pain-free and also make it possible to indulge in exertion freely again. This is a great boon to many.

In 1970, however, the British physicist Stephen William Hawking (b. 1942) reasoned from quantum mechanical considerations that black holes might have a temperature. Therefore, if surrounded by an environment with a lower temperature, black holes would evaporate. Massive black holes with the mass of a star or of many stars would evaporate so slowly that they would endure for many, many times the present age of the Universe. As their mass decreased, however, their rate of evaporation would increase.

The view was developed, then, that the final status of the Universe would not be a collection of black holes but a thin expanding mélange of leptons and photons originating from evaporated black holes.

This investigation into life’s origins took an unusual turn in 1970 when Ponnamperuma studied a meteorite that had fallen in Australia the year before. It was of a rare kind called a carbonaceous chondrite, a

fragile black material that contained measurable quantities of water and organic material. Ponnamperuma showed that five different amino acids of the kind that helped make up protein molecules were present in the meteorite.

These meteoritic amino acids did not originate in living tissue, for if they had (judging from the amino acids in living tissue on Earth), they would all have only one of two possible structural arrangements and would rotate the plane of polarized light (be optically active). The amino acids in the meteorite were optically inactive, meaning that they consisted of both structures in equal amounts, so that each canceled the optical activity of the other. This was to be expected if they had been formed by some process not involving life.

Further exemplifying the strides made in the synthesis of complicated molecules, Li, who had synthesized the enzyme ribonuclease (see 1969), synthesized the still more complicated molecule of growth hormone in 1970.

Recombinant DNA

In 1970 the American microbiologists Hamilton Othanel Smith (b. 1931) and Daniel Nathans (b. 1928) discovered an enzyme that could cut a molecule of DNA at certain

specific sites. The resulting DNA fragments were still large enough to contain genetic information, and this work led to the formation of fragments that could recombine with each other to form new genes that did not exist in nature.

This technique of recombinant DNA became an important tool for geneticists and was a long step toward genetic engineering, in which genes could be modified, transferred, or designed.

For this work, Nathans and Smith shared the Nobel Prize for physiology and medicine in 1978.

1970,Reverse Transcriptase,"['Watson', 'Crick', 'Howard Martin Temin', 'David Baltimore', 'Temin', 'Baltimore']",['American'],"Ever since Watson and Crick had worked out the structure of DNA and shown how it could replicate itself (see 1953), it had been felt (and experimental work had supported the feeling) that genetic information flowed in a one-way fashion from DNA to RNA. It usually turns out, however, that nature is more complicated than expected, and there are apparently loops in the flow that occasionally carry information from RNA back to DNA. In 1970 the American oncologist Howard Martin

Temin (b. 1934), in his investigation of cancer cells, located an enzyme he called reverse transcriptase, which could affect the working of DNA in line with information received from RNA, thus making the DNA more responsive to the needs of the cell.

This same discovery was made independently by the American biochemist David Baltimore (b. 1938). Temin and Baltimore received shares of the Nobel Prize for physiology and medicine in 1975.

1970,Megavitamin Therapy,['Linus Pauling'],['Eijkman'],"The necessity of vitamins in the diet had been recognized since the work of Eijkman (see 1896). The dosages required appeared to be small, however—in fact enzymatic in quantity.

Then it was suggested that the tiny recommended doses were merely those required to prevent the onset of serious disease and that much higher doses were common in primitive human diets that were heavy on fruits and vegetables. It was these much higher doses that might be needed for full health, and people began to speak of megavitamin therapy.

An outstanding propo nent of this view was Linus Pauling (see 1931), who, beginning in 1970, recommended massive doses of vitamin C (ascorbic acid) for health. His views seem not to be accepted by most biochemists, but Pauling’s voice is not one that can be lightly ignored.

1970,Fiber Optics,[],[],"Since current electricity had come into use (see 1800 and 1831), metallic wires, especially those of copper, had been used to conduct the current wherever it was needed.

By 1970 techniques had been developed to conduct light by means of fine, very clear glass fibers. The fibers were coated with plastic or with a second type of glass so chosen that any light that tended to travel out of the fiber into the coating would be totally reflected. In this way, light could follow the fiber around curves and corners. With the use of lasers, such light could be as easily modulated as electric currents, so that sound waves could be converted into light of varying amplitude and, at the other end, reconverted into sound waves.

Fiber optics, by replacing expensive copper with cheap glass and by using the tiny waves of light,

which can carry enormous amounts of information, was instantly seen as having the potential of greatly extending communication by telephone.

1970,Scanning Electron Microscope,['Albert Victor Crewe'],['American'],"In an ordinary electron microscope (see 1932), an electron beam, in a vacuum, passes through the sample being studied and leaves an imprint on the recording device beyond. The sample must be very thin if this is to work.

If a low-energy beam of electrons is used, however, it can scan the surface of a sample much as an electron beam scans the picture tube of a television set. The electrons will induce the surface to emit electrons of its own, and these induced electrons can be detected.

Such a scanning electron microscope produces a three-dimensional effect that gives more information about the surface and produces still greater magnifications than an ordinary electron microscope can do. In some cases it can even show the position of individual atoms.

The first practical scanning electron microscope was built in 1970 by the

British-born American physicist Albert Victor Crewe.

An instrument package was dropped into the atmosphere and made a soft landing. This was the first soft landing of any human-made object on another planet. The instruments sent back information about the atmosphere and surface for 23 minutes before the extreme conditions of temperature and pressure destroyed it.

Mariner 9 approached, but fortunately it was poss to have the probe study its small satellites. They were irregular potato-shaped bodies, with craters as “eyes.”” The longest diameter of Phobos was 17 miles, that of Deimos, 10 miles. Eventually, when the dust storm died down, Mariner 9 was able to take more than seven thousand

There were numerous craters, crowded mostly into one hemisphere, with volcanoes and jumbled terrain in the other. The largest volcano, Olympus

Mons, reached a height of 15 miles above base level and had a base width of about 250 miles.

The atmosphere was only about one-hundredth the density of Earth’s and consisted almost entirely of carbon dioxide. The temperature was too low for liguid water to exist at any time, and the ice caps of Mars may contain both frozen water and frozen carbon dioxide.

Such irregular changes might be the result of matter circling a black hole in varying concentrations.

Cygnus X-1 was at once investigated with great care and found to exist in the immediate neighborhood of a large, hot, blue star about thirty times as massive as our Sun. The Canadian astronomer C. T. Bolt showed that this star and Cygnus X-1 were revolving about each other, and from the nature of the orbit, Cygnus X-1 had to be five to eight times as massive as our Sun, If Cygnus X-1 were a normal star, it would be easily visible.

Since it was not, it must be a small, very dense object. It was too massive to be a neutron star, so it must be a black hole. Though this is not a clear-cut and absolute identification, astronomers are by and large satisfied that it is a

black hole.

Since then, black holes have been observed, by similar indirect and not entirely reliable means, to exist in the centers of various galaxies, including perhaps our own.

Mini-Black Holes

Hawking had proposed that black holes slowly evaporated and that the evaporation increased as mass decreased (see 1970). In 1971 he pointed out that

at the time of the big

bang, black holes of all sizes might have been created.

Some would be so small that the evaporation rate would be high enough to cause the last bit of explosive evaporation to take place right now, some 15 billion vears after formation. Such mini-black holes might be common, and their existence could be proved from the specific characteristics of that final explosion.  The concept is an attractive ane, but so far no astronomer has detected anything that could be inpreted as the final explo1 of a mini-

Not only did it give an overview of geological data, but it was capable of studying forest- and grain-growing areas, yielding data on normal and abnormal growths, plant disease, and so on. Such Earth resource satellites are one of the

many answers to those who ask why so much money and effort is expended on space when there are so many problems on Earth that are crying out for study. Space technology is a powerful tool for studying those problems.

1972,Quantum Chromodynamics,"['Murray', 'John Charnley']",['British'],"By now it was well established that quarks (see 1961) combine two at a

Murray Gell-Mann (see 1953), who had originated the quark concept, labored to work out the rules governing the combination of quarks, He suggested that each quark came in three colors: red, blue, and green. (These colors are not to be taken literally but as an analogy.) Just as in the case of light, a red, a blue, and a en quark will combine to give a lack of color property (white). Only those combinations yielding white can exist

In this way, Gell-Mann founded the study of quantum chromodynamics, on the model of quantum electrodynamics, which had proved to work so well (see 1948). Quarks, however, are much more complicated in their behavior in connec-

X rays had been used in medical diagnosis for threequarters of a century, but in all that time they had been used only to obtain a two-dimensional photograph of a three-dimensional body.

In 1972 a technique was introduced called computerized axial tomographic anning (CAT scan), in which numerous X-ray ‘stills”"" were taken in such a way that they could be put together to form a three-dimensional image.

In 1972 laser disks (also called compact disks) became practical. Here the sound was picked up by a laser beam, which translated it into information recorded on flat disks in the form of microscopically small pits. These could then be picked up by other laser beams. There was no question of wear, more sound could be packed onto a given surface, and reproduction was nearer perfection than ever before.

only 85,000 miles above Jupiter’s surface, going right through the planet’s magnetosphere.

Jupiter’s magnetic field, forty times as ener-

getic as Earth's, made itself felt at a distance of 4,300,000 miles from the planet.

From the data obtained by the probe, it was possible to build a picture of the planet’s structure, It would seem that Jupiter is a ball of hot liquid hydrogen mixed with some helium (a constitution much like that of the Sun).

The temperature rises rapidly with distance beneath the visible cloud surface. At 600 miles below, it is already 3,600° C; at 1,800 miles below, it is 10,000° C; at 15,000 miles below, it is 20,000° C; and at the very center of Jupiter, it is 54,000° C. Below 15,000 miles, hydrogen takes on a metallic form.

Pioneer 10 carried a message from Earth etched into a 6- by 9-inch goldplated aluminum slab. It showed a man and woman next to an outline of Pioneer 10 drawn to scale. Also included were details of the Solar System and its location in the Universe relative to distant quasars.

1973,Origin of the Universe,['Edward P. Tryon'],['American'],"Scientists had come to accept the big bang as the manner in which the Universe had come into being, but that left one crucial question unanswered. Granted that all the matter in the Universe was originally compressed into a comparatively tiny body that expanded into the present Universe, where did that originally tiny body come from?

In 1973 the American physicist Edward P. Tryon pointed out that what we ordinarily think of as a vacuum is not truly a vacuum. It can give rise to subatomie particles that disappear before they can be detected, in accordance with quantum mechanics and the uncertainty principle.

He suggested that if we start with an infinite sea of nothingness, particles will appear and disappear. Every once in a while, a particle may appear that can devlop the mass of the Universe and begin to expand before it can disappear. The Universe may therefore be a random quantum fluctuation in a vacuum, so that it originated out of nothing.

The implications and the detailed development of such a universe have been argued over by astronomers ever since.

This was the beginning of genetic engineering. 1t offered a technique for something as simple and useful  as modifying defective genes to make them normal, thus holding out the hope that genetic defects might someday be cured.

Hartmann', 'Earth Earth', 'Hartmann']","['American', 'Mars', 'Earth', 'Earth Earth']","Over the course of the last century, three different types of suggestions had been made about the origin of the Moon. It was suggested first that the Moon was originally part of the Earth and pulled away as a result of centrifugal effect when the primordial Earth was spinning rapidly. However, Earth had never rotated rapidly enough to make such a pullaway possible.

Second was the thought that Earth and Moon had formed separately from the same swirl of planetesimals. But the Earth and Moon should then have much the same chemical composition, and they don’t. Earth, for instance, has a large nickeliron core while the Moon seems to have none at all.

Third was the thought that Earth and Moon were formed from different swirls of planetesimals, and at some time in the past the

Earth captured the Moon. But the mechanics of such a Moon capture are difficult to work out.

These seemed the only three possibilities, and each one was so flawed that it looked as though the only way out of the mess was to decide that the Moon didn't really exist.

In 1974, however, the American astronomer William K. Hartmann suggested a fourth alternative. Suppose that in the early days of the Solar System, a planet the size of Mars (about one-tenth the mass of the Earth) had had a glancing collision with Earth. It would knock off part of the Earth’s outer layers, which would coalesce into the Moon, while the colliding body coalesced with Earth. The nickel-iron cores of Earth and the colliding object would merge, while the Moon, formed from the outer layers of Earth, would lack such a core.

The suggestion was largely ignored, but eventually computer simulations of such a collision made the idea begin to look good. At the moment, Hartmann's suggestion is preferred to any of the older ones.

On September 10, 1974, the American astronomer Charles T. Kowall did detect a thirteenth Jovian satellite. It was also part of that outermost group, which now numbered five.

The compounds contained chlorine and [luorine atoms attached to a carbon skeleton (chlorofluorocarbons) and seemed absolutely safe. As such chemicals were

released into the air by spray cans and eventually leaked out of air-conditioning units, they did not accumulate in such quantities as to present direct difficulties for any living organism.

On the other hand, some chlorofluorocarbons inevitably drifted upward into the atmosphere and there they encountered the ozone layer. Two American scientists, F. Sherwood Rowland and Mario Molina, pointed out that such chlorofluorocarbons had the potential for destroying the ozone layer, even il they were present in comparatively small amounts. And indeed, in recent years the ozone layer has been observed to be thinning.

As the ozone layer thins, more energetic ultraviolet light from the Sun will be able to reach Earth’s surface, causing increases in the incidence of such problems as skin cancer and cataracts. Worse vet, the ultraviolet may be deadly to soil bacteria and ocean plankton, with incalculable effects on Earth's ecological balance.

In 1974 the American physicist Martin L. Perl found that when electrons and positrons (antielectrons) were smashed together at high energies, still a third variety of lepton was produced. This was named the tau electron, or in shorter version, the tauon. It presumably has a neutrino of its own, and there is surely an antiparticle for each, so that twelve leptons are now known.

The tauon is about 17 times as massive as the muon and about 3,500 times as massive as the electron. It is very unstable and lasts less than five-trillionths of a second before breaking down to a muon.

It may be that twelve leptons are all the leptons there are.

Leptons, however, are

fundamental particles, which cannot be broken down into simpler ones (as far as we now know), while hadrons are composite particles and are made up of quarks. Quarks, like leptons, seem to be fundamental particles.

In 1974 three kinds of quarks were known: u-quarks, d-quarks, and s-quarks. (The letters stand for up, down, and strange, respectively, though sometimes the s is made to stand for sideways to match the other two.) However, theoretical considerations indicated that quarks ought to exist in pairs. Up-quarks and down-quarks were a pair; there ought to be a quark to serve as the pair of the strange-quark. Such a new quark was named a c-quark even belore it was discovered, the ¢ standing for charmed.

In 1974 the American physicist Burton Richter (b. 1931), using the enormous energies of the latest particle accelerators, produced a particle that, from its properties, had to include a c-quark in its makeup. Another American physicist, Samuel Chao Chung Ting (b. 1936), working independently, also produced a particle that had to contain a c-quark. The two shared the Nobel Prize for physics in 1976.

Life on Mars

In 1975 two Mars probes had been launched by the United States, Viking 1 on August 20 and Viking 2 on September 9. Both went into orbit about Mars in mid-1976, and they took the best photographs of the Martian surface yet.

On July 20, 1976, Viking I came down to the Martian surface at what would have been, on Earth, the edge of the tropical zone Some weeks later Viking 2 came down in a more northerly position. In coming down, they discovered that the Martian atmosphere, though chiefly carbon diox-

ide, was also 2.7 percent nitrogen and 1.6 percent argon.

The Martian surface was rocky, as Earth'’s surface is. The Martian surface, however, was richer in iron and sulfur and poorer in aluminum, sodium, and potassium. There was no sign of life on Mars on a scale visible to the eye.

The Viking probes were equipped to run experiments on Martian soil to see if any microscopic forms of life were present. The experiments were carried through with ambiguous results, but there was no trace of organic material in the soil, and this led as-

tronomers to believe that certain lifelike responses to the experiments were the result of some odd chemical behavior of the soil.

The spectrum of the light it reflected from the Sun was studied, and in 1976 it was decided that Pluto’s surface was covered with frozen methane.

1976,Synthetic Gene,['Khorana'],[],"Khorana had synthesized a gene (see 1970). Now he went a step further and

1977,String Theory,[],[],"Suggestions were made in 1976 to the effect that, as the Universe cooled in the first instants after the big bang, flaws or creases would have appeared in the structure of space. These would form long one-dimensional strings containing huge masses, energies, and gravitational

fields. Such thoughts persist, but observational evidence for the existence of such strings has not yet been obtained.

1977,Rings of Uranus,"['Uranus', 'James L. Elliot', 'Uranus Uranus', 'Uranus Uranus Saturn']","['Libra', 'American', 'Uranus']","On March 10, 1977, the planet Uranus moved in front of a ninth-magnitude star in the constellation of

Libra. This occultation was observed by the American astronomer James L. Elliot from an airplane that toock him high enough to minimize the distorting and ob-

scuring effects of the lower atmosphere. The idea was to observe how the starlight dimmed as the atmosphere of Uranus approached the star and

moved in front of it. That would yield information about the atmosphere of Uranus.

Some time before Uranus reached the star, the starlight suddenly dimmed and brightened several times. When Uranus had passed the star and it emerged, the same dimming-brightening pattern occurred in reverse. Apparently Uranus was surrounded by a series of thin concentric rings that were opaque enough to obscure starlight.

In this way, Saturn’s position as the unique possessor of rings was lost, although nothing we know of can duplicate its rings, which are so large, bright, and beautiful.

1977,Chiron,"['Jupiter XIII', 'Jupiter', 'Kowall', 'Uranus', 'Saturn']","['Kowall', 'Uranus', 'Chiron', 'Greek']","On November 1, 1977, Kowall, the discoverer of Jupiter XIII (see 1974), was studying photographic plates, searching for asteroids in Jupiter’s orbit. He detected something that might have been such an asteroid, but it was moving at only one-third the speed that would have associated it with Jupiter’s orbit. It had to be somewhere in the neighborhood of Uranus. Eventually Kowall worked out its orbit and

found that it followed a markedly elliptical path that carried it out as far as Uranus at one end and as close as Saturn at the other, completing one turn about the Sun every 50.7 years. It seemed to be an asteroid, but it was the farthest one yet discovered, and by far. It was named Chiron, after the most famous centaur in Greek mythology.

1977,Inflationary Universe,"['Alan Guth', 'Proton Decay']",['American'],"The concept of the big bang did not answer all questions. Why should the Universe be divided into stars and galaxies if it started as a tiny, unimaginably hot blob of matter? Why didn’t the gas expand into a vast cold blob of undifferentiated matter? Again, why should the Universe be so nearly flat? That is, why should it have a mass that put it so nearly at the borderline between the possibility of expanding forever and the possibility of someday starting to contract again?

In 1977 the American physicist Alan Guth suggested that, from the equations developed for the Grand Unified Theory (see 1973, Proton Decay), it

could be argued that the Universe, in the instants after the big bang, underwent a sudden and exceedingly rapid inflation. (While objects within the Universe cannot move relative to one another more rapidly than the speed of light, the Universe as a whole could theoretically expand at any speed.)

This period of expansion can be used to explain some characteristics of the Universe that the classical big bang theory cannot, but the details are elusive, and the concept of an inflationary universe is still being worked on by cosmogonists.

1977,Vela Pulsar,['Bacteria'],[],"For nine years, the pulsar at the center of the Crab nebula had been the only optical pulsar known (see 1969). In 1977 a second optical pulsar was discovered, in the Vela nebula, which seems also to be the remnant of an old supernova explosion.

Deep-Sea Life

In 1977 it was discovered that there were ocean vents, or “chimneys,” that continually spewed hot water laden with minerals into the ocean. Bacteria

could live in these surroundings by obtaining energy from the oxidation of sulfur compounds present in the spewings. Other life forms could live on the bacteria, so that at the other end of the food chain, large clams and tube-worms were supported.

Here was an entire society that lived on chemical change involving neither light nor photosynthesis. That such complex life forms could exist independently of photosynthesis had not been expected.

Independent research at this time discovered primitive forms of bacterial life that obtained energy by reducing carbon dioxide to methane. These methanogens live independently of oxygen.

Obviously bacterial life is tremendously versatile.

Enough bones were dug up to make up about 40 percent of a complete skeleton. It was an australopithecine (see 1924), about 3'% feet tall. Its scientific name was Australopithecus afarensis, but since it was clearly the skel-

eton of a female, it was named, whimsically, Lucy. The most interesting thing about Lucy is that she was obviously bipedal. From her hip and thighbones it is clear that she walked erect as easily as we do. It may be that this bipedal locomotion was the first adaptation that served to differentiate organisms that are more humanlike (hominids) from those that are more apelike (pongids).

Nonbacterial DNA

Bacterial DNA, which is easy to work with, is densely packed with meaningful genes. In other words, every part of bacterial DNA can be used as a blueprint for the synthesis of proteins. This is not surprising, since bacterial cells are much smaller than the cells of plants or animals, and there is no space to waste within them.

In 1977 it was discovered that the DNA in nonbacterial cells is not densely packed with genes. Much of the DNA molecule consists of stretches of nucleotides that appear to be meaningless and in any case are not used to manufacture proteins. Nonbacterial cells are large and can

afford such waste, but it is hard to believe that they would. Nevertheless, if the “nonsense'’ portions of nonbacterial DNA have significance and purpose, what it is has yet to be discovered.

Smallpox and AIDS

In 1977 the last case of smallpox was recorded, in Semalia. The smallpox virus is now thought to be extinct except for samples grown in laboratories for research purposes.

The ending of one scourge, however, seemed to have been balanced by the coming of another. In 1977 two male homosexuals in New York City were found to have a rare form of cancer, which was eventually recognized to be a symptom of a disease called acquiived immune deficiency syndrome, usually abbreviated AIDS. This disease, usually fatal and so far incurable, spread rapidly and became as feared in the 1980s as smallpox was in the 1780s.

It sent several probes into Venus's atmosphere and found that the cloud layer contained droplets of sulfuric acid, that about 2.5 percent of the sunlight striking the cloud layer penetrated to the surface of the planet, and that the atmosphere was 96.6 percent carbon dioxide and 3.2 percent nitrogen. In view of its density, that meant Venus's atmosphere had more than three times

as much nitrogen as Earth’s.

Venus Pioneer also beamed radar waves at Venus, and from the reflections, details of the surface (otherwise invisible from outside the cloud layer) could be determined.

The surface of Venus does not appear to be broken into plates as Earth's is and is mostly of the type we associate with continents. It seems to have a huge supercontinent that covers about five-sixths of the total surface, with the remaining sixth a lowland that may once have contained water.

In the north is a large plateau named Ishtar Terra,

about as large as the United States. On the eastern portion of the plateau is a mountain range. There is another and even larger plateau in the equatorial region called Aphrodite Terra. It too has mountains.

There are also canyons and what may be extinet volcanoes.

Christy, examining photographs of Pluto, noted a distinct lump on one side. He checked other photographs and found that the lump shifted position. Finally he decided it was a satellite lo-

cated some 12,500 miles from Pluto. (At Pluto’s distance, this is not much of a separation as seen from Earth, which accounts for the long-delayed discovery.)

Christy named the satellite Charon, after the ferryman who took shades across the River Styx to Hades in Greek mythology

Charon circles Pluto in 6.39 days, which is just the time it takes for Pluto to turn on its axis. The two bodies, Plute and Charon, have slowed each other’s rotational speed through tidal action until each perpetually presents one side to the other. They now revolve about a common center of gravity like two unequal parts of a dumbbell held together by a gravitational pull. (This is the only dumbbell-situation in the Universe that we have been able to observe so far.)

From the distance of separation and the time of revolution, it is possible to work out the total mass of the two bodies, which comes to about one-eighth the mass of the moon. Pluto is about 1,850 miles in di-

ameter (far smaller than anyone had thought), and Charon is about 750 miles in diameter. Charon has 10 percent the mass of Pluto, so that the two are the nearest thing to a double planet we know. (The Earth-Moon is second in this respect, but the Moon has only 2 percent the mass of the Earth.)

The genes concerned were called oncogenes, the prefix being the one commonly used in medical terminology for “tumor.”

The oncogene was found to be very similar to a normal gene. The two might differ, in fact, in a single amino acid along the chain. The picture therefore arises of a normal gene (a protooncogene), which is replicated with every cell division and, through some accidental change during one of the replications, be-

COIMEs an oncogene.

The most interesting result was that they gave humanity its first close look at the four Galilean satellites.

The satellites are subject to tidal heating from Jupiter, a heating that increases rapidly as distance from Jupiter decreases. Thus, Ganymede and Callisto, the outermost pair, are both covered with craters as might be expected and seem to be made up largely of icy material.

Europa, second-closest to Jupiter, is not cratered it has, in fact, the smoothest solid surface yet seen in the Solar System—but cracked and criss-crossed with lines (rather like the old maps of Mars that showed the supposed canals). Apparently Europa is covered with a worldwide glacier that has liquid un-

derneath. Any cosmic collision that might ordinarily cause a crater merely cracks the glacier, and the hole produced is then repaired by the formation of additional ice.

lo, the closest of the four satellites to Jupiter, has no water at all, the heating having driven it off. In fact, the inner heating produces active volcanoes, which the probes photographed in actual eruption. Sulfur dioxide exudes and breaks up into sulfur and oxygen. lo's surface is therefore covered by a yellow to red layer of sulfur, which fills in any but the most recent of craters. The eruptions also account for the thin gas that fills Io’s orbit, forming a doughnut around Jupiter.

In addition to all of this, three more small satellites were discovered, all of them closer to Jupiter than any that had been discovered from Earth. This made sixteen satellites all told for Jupiter. Finally, very close to Jupiter, a thin ring of debris was found, so that Jupi-

ter joined Saturn and Uranus in being a ringed planet.

1979,Extinction of the Dinosaurs,"['Walter Alvarez', 'Earth', 'Alvarez']","['American', 'Italy']","In 1979 the American scientist Walter Alvarez was trying to establish sedimentation rates in old sedimentary rocks in Italy. To do that, he made use of neutron-activation techniques that allowed him to determine with great precision the quantities of various rare elements present in the rocks.

He found to his surprise that a certain narrow layer of the rock contained some twenty-five times as much of the rare metal iridium as there was above and below it. The narrow layer that contained the iridium was sixty-five million years old and was therefore right at the boundary where the Mesozoic era yields to the Cenozoic era. At that boundary, dinosaurs and many other species of plants and animals had be COme inct with surprising suddenness.

Voyager 2 followed not long after. A number of the satellites of Saturn were for the first time seen as more than points of light.

Titan, the largest satellite, was known to have an atmosphere of methane, but methane turned out to be present in small quantities compared to nitrogen. (Nitrogen is a gas difficult to detect from Earth because its absorption characteristics are not easy to observe and study.) The Titanian atmosphere turned out to be 98 percent nitrogen and 2 percent methane and may be thicker than Earth’s atmosphere. The atmospheric haze prevented any view of the surface, where there might be nitrogen lakes with dissolved polymers of methane and (a few speculate) possibly some form of life.

The other Saturnian

satellites were, as might be expected, cratered. Mimas, the innermost of the nine sizable satellites, has a crater so large that the impact that produced it must have nearly shattered it.

Enceladus, the second of the nine, is comparatively smooth, while Hyperion is the least spherical and has a diameter that varies from 90 to 120 miles. Iapetus is a two-toned satellite, with one hemisphere much darker than the other, as though one side were icy and the other coated with dark dust. The reason for this is not yet clear.

The Saturn probes succeeded in finding eight satellites that were too small to be seen from Earth, bringing the total number to seventeen. Of the new satellites, five are closer to Saturn than Mimas is. Two satellites that are just inside Mimas's orbit are unusual in being co-orbital. That is, they share the same orbit, chasing each other around Saturn endlessly. This was the first

known example of such coorbital satellites. .

The three new satellites beyond Mimas also represent unprecedented situations. The long-known satellite Dione was found to have a tiny co-orbital companion, Dione B, which circles Saturn at a point 60 degrees ahead of Dione. As a result, Saturn, Dione, and Dione B are always at the apices of an equilateral triangle. This is a comparatively stable gravitational position, called a Trojan situation because it is also the position of the Sun, Jupiter, and the Trojan asteroids (see 1906).

The satellite Tethys has two tiny companions, one 60 degrees ahead of it in orbit and one 60 degrees behind it. Clearly, the Saturnian satellite system is the richest and most complex in the Solar System.

The Saturnian rings were also found to be far more complex than had been thought. From a close view, they consist of hundreds, perhaps even thousands, of thin ringlets,

which look like the grooves on a phonograph record. In places, dark streaks show up at right angles to the ringlets, like spokes on a wheel. Then too, a faint outermost ring seems to consist of three intertwined ringlets. None of this can be explained so far. It may be that a straightforward gravitational situation is being complicated by electromagnetic effects.

1981,Neutrino Mass,['Frederick Reines'],"['Moscow', 'Earth']","In 1980 Frederick Reines (see 1956) reported on experiments that indicated neutrinos might have tiny quantities of mass (for years they had been thought to be massless).

Researchers in Moscow reported similar results in an entirely different experiment and thought the neutrino mass might be 1/13,000 of an electron.

If this were so, then

the three neutrinos—the electron-neutrino, the muon-neutrino, and

the tauon-neutrino—might well have slightly different masses and be capable of oscillating; that is, of continually changing from one to another.

If this were so, it would explain the fact that the Sun seems to emit only one-third the number of neutrinos it ought to. It should be emitting electron-neutrinos only, and detecting devices would only pick up electron-neutrinos., But if the neutrinos oscillated, the electron-neutrinos emitted by the Sun might change into muonneutrinos and tauon-neutrinos en route to Earth and arrive here in equal quantities. The detecting devices would then pick up only the one-third that were elec-

tron-neutrinos. Then, too, even if the neutrinos had only a tiny

nass, lh\ilf were so many neutrinos in the Universe that their total mass might make up a hundred times as much mass as everything else put together. The presence of this mass, ignored until now by astronomers, might explain how galaxies rotate, how clusters of galaxies hang together, and how the galaxies formed in the first place. All these things would make sense if the “mystery of the missing mass’ were solved by attributing it to neutrinos.

Furthermore, the presence of missing mass in the form of neutrinos would be just sufficient to close the Universe; that is, to make certain that the Universe would someday begin to contract again.

The only trouble with all this is that the question of the neutrino’s mass has not yet been confirmed, and it may well be a false alarm.

For that reason, the

Its purpose was to go into orbit and then return to

Earth. It was not in itself designed to make spaceflight cheap; it was an expensive vessel. However, it would help engineers work out the techniques for developing a future genera tion of such vessels that would be cheaper.

The first shuttle flight took place on April 12, 1981, which happened, by coincidence, to be the twentieth anniversary of the first spaceflight by Gagarin (see 1961). The shuttle left and returned safely. It was the first of over a score of such flights during the next four and a half years to be carried through safely.

star passed into and out of occultation with Uranus, and in the case of Neptune it was not.

The suggestion was therefore made that Neptune did not have symmetrical rings but merely arcs of ring material that did not stretch all the way around the planet. If so, this is another unprecedented situation.

1982,Millisecond Pulsar,[],[],"The fastest pulsar (see 1967) known was in the Crab nebula and rotated some 30 times a second, emitting pulses at that rate. It was also the youngest pulsar known, and there didn't seem to be much chance of finding a pulsar still younger and more rapid.

In 1982, however, a pulsar was found that rotated more than twenty times as fast, at 642 times per sec-

ond. Moreover, it did not show signs of being a particularly young pulsar. There was a suggestion that it was (or had been) part of a double star system and that, by absorbing matter from its companion, it had gained angular momentum and speeded up.

1982,Magnetic Monopole,"['Maxwell', 'Magnetism', 'Maxwell Proton Decay', 'Blas Cabrera', 'Cabrera']",[],"Maxwell’s equations (see 1865) are not quite symmetrical with respect to electricity and magnetism.

Magnetism, xists as north

By the Grand Unified Theory (see 1973, Proton Decay), it would seem that magnetic monopoles must exist but must be so monstrously massive that there could only have been enough energy to form them in the immediate instants following the big bang. Still, if they were formed then, they should still exist today, and scientists should be able to detect them.

Therefore, the physicist Blas Cabrera devised a setup that would produce an electric current if a magnetic monopole were to pass through it, and on February 14, 1982, it produced such a current.

That single detection has not yet been repeated, however, either by Cabrera or by anyone else, so the existence of the magnetic monopole remains in question.

The electroweak theory (see 1968) made it seem necessary for the weak interaction to involve three exchange particles, one positive (W+), one negative (W), and one neutral (Z°). They were massive particles, at least eighty times as massive as protons, which accounted for their being so elusive. It took a great deal of energy to form them.

By 1983, however, physicists had sufficient energy at their disposal to be able to detect all three particles. They did so and found that the particles had the predicted mass, too. That nailed the electroweak theory into place.

In any case, this was the best evidence yet that stars other than the Sun might possess planets and that such extrasolar planets might even be common.

A group of people, of whom Carl Sagan (b. 1935) was most prominent, suggested that in the case of an all-out nuclear war, the explosion of thousands of nu-

clear bombs would raise enough dust to cut off sunlight for a considerable period and produce a nuclear winter. Mass starvation would then follow for the whole planet, not only for the loser of the nuclear exchange but for the “winner'"" as well, and for all the neutrals.

The predicted intensity of such a nuclear winter seems to have moderated a bit since the first pessimistic projections, but the side effects of a nuclear exchange in the form of fires, fallout, and disruption of the world’s economy would surely be dreadful enough even if there were no nuclear winter at all.

DNA and Human Evolution

DNA molecules change with time, forming mutations (see 1937). Presumably, if the DNA molecules of two different species are compared, then the more closely related the speci are, the fewer the differences. And from the number of differences, one can tell, perhaps, the length of time it has taken the two species to differentiate from a common ancestor

Since the mutations are the

result of chance changes, conclusions cannot be

drawn with mathematical certainty, but they are suggestive.

In 1984 such DNA analysis was used to present reasons for supposing that human beings and chimpanzees were more closely related to each other, evolutionarily, than either was to gorillas or orangutans, and that human beings and chimpanzees diverged from a common ancestor some five to six million years ago.

It was moderately heated to the point of just glowing, and it gave off radiation rich in infrared, by other types of nuclear reactions, perhaps.

In 1985 Charon, which had been discovered near perihelion (see 1978), began to move in front of Pluto on the way to moving behind it. By studying the light of Pluto alone, when Charon was behind it, and the light from both bodies, when Charon was in front of it but not covering all of it, something could be deduced about the surfaces of the two bodies.

Thus, whereas Pluto’s surface is frozen methane, the smaller Charon cannot hold on to methane. Its surface is frozen water.

Uranus's rings, detected from Earth nine years earlier, were confirmed. The five known satellites turned out to be somewhat larger than had been thought, and no fewer than ten small satellites were found to be circling at a smaller distance than that of Miranda, the already-known satellite nearest to Uranus. Miranda was particularly astonishing. It was

only 300 miles in diameter, so it could not have had enough internal heat to power geological change. Nevertheless, it had a veritable jumble of different surface features.

Its appearance in 1986 was unfortunately not a showy one, since it remained rather far from Earth even at its closest approach and could only be seen high in the sky from the southern hemisphere.

It was an unprecedented return, however, since it could now be studied by probes sent out by the Soviet Union and by

the European Space Agency. The European probe, named Giotto (after the painter who had been the first to paint the comet realistically—see 1304), made the closest approach.

Comets had been pictured as “dirty snowballs” by Whipple (see 1949), and he was shown to be right, but Halley's comet turned out to be far dirtier than expected. While it lost ice each time it approached the Sun, it lost rocky particles to a much smaller extent and they accumulated on the surface, forming a kind of crust, through which the vapors formed by heated ice broke through at weak spots here and there. The result was that Halley's comet was dark black in color.

This meant it was larger than expected. Since it reflected so little light, a larger surface was required to produce its observed brightness.

1987,Magellanic Supermnova,"['Milky Way Galaxy', 'Kepler']",[],"The last supernova that had been visible in our own Milky Way Galaxy was one studied by Kepler in 1604. Since then, the nearest supernova had been one spied 2,300,000 light-years away in the Andromeda galaxy (see 1886), but at the time it was not known to be a supernova and was not carefully studied even with the instruments then available. Since then, the only supernovas to have been noted had been in still more distant galaxies.

In February 1987, however, a supernova was caught in its early explosive stage in the Large Magellanic Cloud. That was not in our own galaxy to be sure, but it was in the galaxy closest to our own, only 150,000 light-years away.

The explosion had been heralded by a spray of neutrinos, some of which were caught in recently devised neutrino telescopes. Undoubtedly, as more and better instruments of the sort are built, the sky will be regularly scanned for neutrinos that may herald supernova explosions.

The Magellanic supernova was carefully studied as the light built up and faded and as the nebulosity about it expanded and thinned. In 1988 the expected appearance of a pulsar at its center rotating two thousand times per second was reported.

1988,Warm Superconductivity,"['Kamerlingh Onnes', 'Liquid', 'Liquid Karl Alex Mueller', 'Johannes Georg Bednorz', 'Mueller', 'Bednorz']","['Swiss', 'German']","Ever since superconductivity had been discovered by Kamerlingh Onnes (see 1911), scientists had tried

to find materials that were superconductive at as high a temperature as possible in order to make superefficient electrical conduction practical in everyday applications. All the metallic elements were studied, as were large numbers of alloys, but no superconductivity was found at temperatures higher than 23 degrees above absolute zero (23° K). This meant that superconductivity could only be experienced at liquid helium temperatures, and liguid helium is an expensive commodity.

Liquid hydrogen exists only at temperatures higher than 20° K, and the superconductivity transition point would have to be substantially higher than that to make it completely useful in a liquid hydrogen bath. Even if it could be done, liquid hydrogen, while less expensive than

liquid helium, would surely give off hydrogen gas and create the danger of explosion.

Liquid nitrogen is much cheaper and easier to prepare and use than either liquid helium or liquid hydrogen. It is also quite safe to use. Unfortunately, it exists only at temperatures higher than 77° K, and that seemed hopelessly high.

In February 1987, however, a Swiss physicist, Karl Alex Mueller (b. 1927), and a German colleague,

Johannes Georg Bednorz (b. 1950), studying ceramic substances (mixtures of metallic oxides) rather than metals, found they were obtaining superconductivity at temperatures of 30° K. This broke with shattering impact on the scientific community. Everyone began studying ceramics, and superconductivity in the liquid nitrogen temperature range was obtained. The difficulties that remain are that no good theoretical explanation of this

astonishing behavior of ceramics exists, so that it is still a matter of “cookbook chemistry,” as properties vary erratically from one ceramic to another and from one batch of a particular ceramic to another. Then too, ceramics are not easy to form into film or wire, so that much must be done before technological applications can be made. Nevertheless, Mueller and Bednorz, without delay, shared the Nobel Prize for physics in 1987

important with respect to the birth of the Universe. If the galaxies were seventeen billion light-years away, it had taken their light seventeen billion years to reach us, and we were seeing them as they existed seventeen billion years ago. This meant that even seventeen billion years ago the Universe was old enough to have formed galaxies.

The age of the Universe has not been determined precisely. It depends on knowledge concerning the distance of galaxies and the rate at which the Universe is expanding. These are uncertain quantities. The age of the Universe has been set at somewhere between ten and twenty billion years, with fifteen billion as the most probable.

If the distant galaxies are actually at the distance estimated, however, it would seem that the Universe must be older than we had thought. Again, any information we can get from those distant galaxies may tell us more about the formation and youth of galaxies, and that may change our ideas about how and when the Universe formed.

1988,Shroud of Turin,['Jesus'],"['Turin', 'Jesus', 'France', 'Turin Libby']","The Shroud of Turin is a linen cloth that seems to possess an image, front and back, of a bearded, longhaired man, which resembles the popular conception of Jesus. It was first displayed in France in the 1350s and in 1578 was taken to Turin, [taly.

Many people believed it to be the burial sheet of Jesus with the image produced by miraculous means. Others, more skeptical, assumed it to be a forgery produced not long before it was first shown.

In 1988 some of the linen was finally tested by

the carbon-14 dating method worked out by Libby (see 1947). The results were clear. The linen had been part of living flax plants seven hundred years ago. The shroud, and presumably the image upon it, had been produced not long before it was first displayed and was thirteen centuries too late to have been the shroud of Jesus.

1989,Greenhouse Effect,['Earth'],"['Arrhenius', 'United States', 'Earth']","It had been known since Arrhenius (see 1884) had pointed it out that carbon dioxide in the atmosphere acted as a heat trap, making Earth's temperature warmer than it would otherwise be. (This was called the greenhouise effect.)

[t was also known that the carbon dioxide content of the atmosphere had been rising steadily since 1900, partly because of the increasing use of coal and oil, which produce carbon dioxide when burned, and partly because of the cut-

ting down of forests, which are the most efficient consumers of carbon dioxide.

As it happened, 1987 was the warmest year yet recorded by weather bureaus, and 1988 was warmer still, What’s more, 1988 saw disastrous droughts in the United States and elsewhere. There was a feeling that the greenhouse effect was intensifying, and world concern began to intensify accordingly.

Rising temperatures would not only alter Earth's climate (probably for the worse) but could promote the melting of Earth's ice caps to produce a disastrous rise in sea level of up to 200 feet. The greenhouse effect, plus the thinning of the ozone layer, the steady rise in environmental pollution, and the inexorable increase in population, seemed to have placed the very habitability of our planet at risk, and a sense of crisis was beginning to pervade the world.

1989,Neptune and Triton,"['Neptune', 'Neptune Jupiter', 'Neptune Neptune', 'Neptune Neptune Voyager', 'Neptune Triton', 'Neptune Saturn', 'Titan', 'Jupiter', 'Triton', 'Neptune Voyager']","['Earth', 'Saturn', 'Uranus', 'Neptunian']","On August 25, Voyager 2 flew within 3,000 miles of the pale-blue-gas giant Neptune, making dramatic discoveries about the planet and its moons.

Neptune rotates once every 16.1 hours. While its blue color comes from the presence of methane gas, its atmosphere’s most preyalent gases are hydrogen and helium. The weather on Neptune is extremely dynamic, with the fastest winds—up to 1,500 mph— detected on any planet. Like Jupiter, with its Great Red Spot, Neptune has an especially turbulent atmospheric storm—as large in diameter as the planet Earth—that scientists have dubbed the Great Dark Spot.

Neptune's planetary magnetism is unusual compared to that of Earth, whose magnetic pole is centered and closely aligned with its geographic pole. For reasons that are not yet understood, Neptune's magnetic axis is steeply tilted (about 50°) in relation to its rotational axis. Just

as puzzling is the fact that the magnetic field is considerably offset from the planet’s center. From afar, Neptune’s rings look like partial “ring arcs,” seemingly interrupted in places as they circled the planet. Data from Voyager revealed that the four major rings— probably, like those of Saturn and Uranus, composed partly of water ice and debris from the breakup of colliding small moons— seem interrupted because they vary in density and structure. One theory is that such uneven composition indicates an aging ring structure.

Voyager 2 discovered six new Neptunian moons —three with very dark surfaces and irregularly shaped, the largest 250 miles in diameter—for a total of eight known satellites. The makeup of the planet’s rings has led to speculation that there may be more, smaller moons.

Neptune's largest moon, Triton, had first been seen in 1846, the same year Neptune was discovered. Like Saturn’s Titan and Jupiter’s [o, Triton has an atmosphere and a surface temperature (—391° F)

that make it one of the Solar System’s coldest worlds. Geysers erupt with five-mile-high plumes of nitrogen and methane, and a pinkish-white polar cap composed of the same gases freezes and sublimes, its location shifting with the seasons.

Neptune was Voyager's last planetary stop in an odyssey that is planned to continue for another two decades. Its next mission is to explore interstellar space.

1989,Cold Fusion,"['Stanley Pons', 'Martin Fleischmann', 'Fleischmann']","['Stellarator', 'American', 'British', 'U.S.', 'Energy']","For years researchers had looked for a feasible means of producing nuclear fusion, which occurs when atomic nuclei combine, releasing energy (see 1951, Stellarator). The problem was that the known methods of combining nuclei required great amounts of heat to initiate the reaction. Scientists had been trying to develop a way to contain the required heat, with no practical solutions yet reported.

So the March 23 announcement by American chemist B. Stanley Pons (b. 1943) and British chemist

Martin Fleischmann (b. 1927) that they had devised a method of achieving nuclear fusion at room temperature caused understandable excitement, for it promised a revolution in energy production. News media around the world carried reports of the supposed breakthrough.

The “cold fusion” apparatus was simple. A jar held a palladium cathode surrounded by a solution containing deuterium, a heavy isotope of hydrogen. The chemists claimed that when an electric current was passed through the solution, the deuterium nuclei were condensed so tightly within the crystalline structure of the palladium that they fused, generating energy in the form of heat. Unfortunately, when other scien-

tists tried to duplicate the experiment, they were unable to confirm the cold fusion findings. They also reported inconsistencies in the Pons-Fleischmann data

troducing discoveries and breakthroughs. Instead of submitting their work to a peer-review process—discussion at conferences, the scrutiny involved in publication in scientific journals —they held a press conference. Moreover, the information they provided lacked significant details of their experiments.

Within weeks of the original announcement, headlines discrediting cold fusion replaced the earlier euphoric discussions. After continuing controversy, a U.S. Department of Energy

1990,Genetic Medicine,"['Huntington', 'Michael Blaese', 'French Anderson', 'Human Genonie']","['Duchenne', 'American', 'Health']","During the 1980s, researchers began identifying specific genes that were related to particular illnesses, as well as methods for treating illness on the genetic level. Early breakthroughs included identification of genes that, when defective, cause cystic fibrosis (CF), Duchenne muscular dystrophy, neurofibromatosis, cardiomyopathy, Huntington’s disease, certain cancers, and various illnesses related to a weakened immune system. One successful therapeutic method involved disarming a virus, inserting into it copies of a normal gene, then introducing the virus into an environment dominated by defective genes. For example, in laboratory experiments researchers were able to “cure” CF; they used a virus to transfer copies of the normal CF gene into diseased cells, which regained the ability to keep clear of the sticky CF mucus that

damages the lungs and other organs.

In 1990 American physicians R. Michael Blaese (b. 1939) and W. French Anderson (b. 1936), working at the National Institutes of Health, conducted the first successful human gene therapy on a four-year-old girl who suffered from a genetic immune system disorder caused by the deficiency of a particular protein. They removed white blood cells from the girl's bloodstream, used harmless viruses to “infect” the blood cells with genes that would produce the protein, then infused the cells back into her body. This therapy had to be repeated periodically as the supply of altered blood cells died off; nevertheless, it was a major improvement over earlier treatments that were more painful, more costly, and less effective in improving the child’s resistance to infection.

Scientists working on the international Human Genonie project, created in the late 1980s, have predicted that they will com-

plete the mapping of the entire human genetic code early in the twenty-first century.

Genetic medicine has not proceeded without controversy. On the positive side, it promises the ability to accurately predict and effectively treat disease. Critics fear, however, that gene therapy could lead to discrimination against people with genetic profiles that are perceived as liabilities (for example, a predisposition to a disease or to homosexuality) or to unanticipated negative consequences (such as the stimulation of cancers or other illnesses). Some even fear that, taken far enough, it could lead to social engineering reminiscent of the experiments of the Nazis.

1991,Hubble Space Telescope,"['Discovery', 'Named', 'Edwin Powell Hubble', 'Earth', 'Milky W', 'Cloud', 'Charon', 'Tt', 'M51']","['Cepheids', 'Andromeda', 'Earth', 'deSaturnian']","On April 24, 1990, after four decades of planning, the shuttle Discovery sent the Hubble Space Telescope (HST) into orbit 381 miles above Earth. Named

.  for Edwin Powell Hubble (see 1923, Cepheids in Andromeda, and 1929, Receding Galaxies), who discovered some of the phenomena it was designed to explore, the boxecar-size unmanned observatory was, at 12 tons, the largest satellite ever launched.

Earth's atmosphere blurs the visible light that comes from bodies in space, and it blocks ultraviolet and infrared light rays, forms of radiation given off by many astronomical objects, Because of its orbit, HST would make clearer images in visible light and record images in parts of the spectrum not visible from Earth. The resolution of HST's images was to be ten times sharper than that of any Earth-based telescopes, and its probing power promised views deeper into space than ever before possible.

HST was to measure the size and thus the age of the universe, to record dis-

tant objects that now can be seen only faintly, and to register the ultraviolet spectra of distant and ancient quasars. It would probe for the possibility of a black hole at the « of the Milky W about the birth of stars and search for planets s similar to our

around s Sun.

All of this was not to be —at least not for a while— for HST's primary mirror had a crucial flaw, called a spherical aberration, that damaged its ability to return clear images in visible light. In addition, the telescope wiggled when it traveled in and out of sunlight, blurring 15 to 20 percent of its images. This meant that HST was able to carry out only about half its intended missions. Nevertheless, within its first two years of operation HST sent back amounts of nl‘c\‘inu:ly

1991,Fullerene Research,"['Buckyballs', 'Shaped']",[],"Growing knowledge about a molecule postulated in 1985, isolated in 1990, and first imaged in 1991 led to a flood of research on buckminsterfullerene (the “buckyball,” for short), a soccer-ball-shaped molecule named for the inventor of the geodesic dome, another structure it resembles

A third form of carbon —the others are diamond and graphite—the buckyball (C60) is a highly stable molecule consisting of 60 carbon atoms in an arrangement of 12 pentagonal and 20 hexagonal faces. Its intriguing structure led chemists to suggest that, along with a related group of molecules called fullerenes, it may give rise to a whole new class of materials.

Because fullerenes are highly resilient, they might be used to manufacture

high-strength materials or super-hard coatings. Because they do not react with corrosive gases, they may also be excellent lubricants. Buckyballs readily absorb and release electrons, and so may be superior to the lead-acid battery for storing energy. Shaped into tiny tubes, they might act as electrical conductors.

Other molecules can be encased within the buckyball’s spherical structure, so researchers are looking for ways to use it to deliver diagnostic or therapeutic chemicals to sites within the body. Similarly, this molecular storage unit could encapsulate radioactive substances or hold materials that store electronic information,

One of the most exciting prospects for the fullerenes is their potential as warm superconductors (see 1987). With the addition of potassium or other metals to the buckyball structure, researchers have achieved

superconductivity at temperatures as high as 45° K, above that at which the oxide ceramics superconduct.

Despite the large amount of research that has been done on the fullerenes, important issues remain. There have been questions about their possible toxicity, an abundant natural source has not been found, and they are unstable when exposed to air.

1991,Volcanic Venus,"['Magellan', 'Magellan Earth', 'Mount Everest', 'Volcanic', 'Volcanic Earth', 'Magellan Large', 'Earth']","['Venus', 'Earth', 'Venusian', 'Venusian Venus']","By the end of 1991, the Venus orbiter Magellan, sent into space in May 1989, had completed mapping more than 90 percent of the planet’s surface. Scientists were familiar with the harsh atmosphere on Venus: mostly carbon dioxide, with a little nitrogen and sulfuric acid, at a pressure 90 times that on Earth and superheated to 900° F. Now Magellan's powerful radar pierced this  dense Venusian veil for a close-up look at the surface, resolving details as small as 400 feet across and returning the best images ever.

The arid plateaus on Venus are the size of Earth’s continents, punctuated by mountains as high as 38,000 feet (9,000 feet taller than Mount Everest) and a few large craters up to 30 miles across. An ancient “river” bed that may have carried liquid sulfur travels in an undulating course up and down hills across 4,800 miles, graphic testimony to ages-old convection patterns in the underlying mantle.

Volcanic domes half a mile high and 12 miles wide dot the Venusian landscape. Volcanic ash is strewn across the planet’s surface, more than half of which is covered with lava flows, some as long as 125 miles. It appears that the present shape of Venus's landscape resulted from convective upwelling of molten mantle rather than the tectonic plate activity that has sculpted Earth's surface.

Magellan provided scientists with considerable evidence that the volcanoes on Venus are active. Large crater-free areas appear to have been recently “‘resurfaced’ with lava. The dark

(unweathered) color of lava at the top of Maat Mons, the second-highest peak, suggests that it was deposited there within the past decade or so. Some mountains appear to be newly built, and there are dramatic fault lines.

Such activity would qualify the planet for membership in an exclusive club with Earth and the moons Io and Triton—the only worlds where volcanic activity is known.

1991,First Asteroid Photograph,"['Jupiter', 'Gaspra', 'Mars', 'Jupiter Irregularly']",['Galileo'],"On October 29, the Galileo space probe, sent into space in 1989 and on its way to a rendezvous with Jupiter in 1995, traveled within 1,000 miles of the asteroid 951 Gaspra and relayed the first black-and-white photographs ever taken of an asteroid in space. Gaspra orbits the Sun between Mars and Jupiter. Irregularly shaped— one astronomer said it looked like a dented football—Gaspra is marked with deep, criss-crossing grooves and heavily pitted with more than 600 meteorite craters; it is 12 miles long and 8 miles wide. Because of a defect in Galileo's antenna, photos taken the following year

1992,Gamma Ray Bursts,"['Atlantis', 'Milky Way', 'Earth']","['U.S.', 'Earth']","While scanning the skies for violations of the Nuclear Test-Ban Treaty in the 1970s, U.S. government detectors recorded bursts of gamma rays from outside the Solar System. Astronomers wanted to know more; as the most powerful type of radiation, gamma rays may be the first signals we receive from extremely distant heavenly bodies. In April 1991, the space shuttle Atlantis put the 17-ton Gamma Ray Observatory (GRO) into orbit 280 miles above Earth. Its mission was to make the first survey of gamma-ray sources throughout the universe and particularly to study such explosive energy sources as SUpernovas, quasars, neutron stars, pulsars, and black holes.

Early data from GRO suggested that the flashbulb-like bursts, which release more energy in a tenth of a second than the Sun releases in ten thousand years, resulted from collisions of neutron stars with comets, gas clouds, or other stars. After six months, however, the GRO

data grew mysterious. Neu-

tron stars are clustered, while the bursts were distributed evenly throughout space, leaving scientists puzzling over their nature and their distance from Earth.

During its first year in orbit, GRO recorded gamma rays from quasars that lie between 10 billion and 20 billion light years from Earth and that emit 10 to 100 million times the total gamma-ray output of

the Milky Way. It also detected a gamma-ray pulsar with a magnetic field trillions of times stronger than Earth'’s.

1993,Background Microwave Radiation,"['Penzias', 'George Fitzgerald Smoot', 'Larger Role', 'Ribosomes', 'Thomas Robert Cech', 'Sidney Altman', 'Cech', 'Altman', 'Harry Francis Noller']","['Gamow', 'Wilson', 'American', 'Earth', 'American Universe', 'American Chemistry']","Gamow (see 1948) had first postulated and Penzias and Wilson (see 1964) had confirmed the existence of

background microwave radiation, which permeates

space as the afterglow of the big bang. But cosmogonists needed data on the makeup of the radiation to bolster theories about the formation of galaxies and other large structures in the Universe. Thus the scientific world eagerly awaited results from the Cosmic Background Ex-

plorer (COBE), an American satellite launched in November 1989 into an orbit 560 miles above Earth, for COBE's instruments were |00 times more sensitive than previous devices, At first COBE reported that the background radiation was perfectly smooth.

e

Then in April 1992, American astrophysicist George Fitzgerald Smoot (b. 1945), who headed COBE’s team of analysts, announced that the satellite’s radiometers had found fluctuations in the background radiation. The fluctuations, preserved from a time 300,000 years after the big bang, proved there were spots in the cooling primordial soup that were very slightly cooler (denser) and hotter (less dense) than others. These variations caused gravitational differences that gave rise to the clumping together of matter as stars, galaxies, and larger cosmic structures began to form.

Two theories related to the concept of the big bang benefited from COBE's findings. In explaining the formation of cosmic structures and particularly in noting very small fluctuations in the background radiation, COBE supported the idea of an inflationary Universe (see 1977).

The data on the clump-

ing together of primordial matter also corroborated the theory of dark matter, invisible or transparent matter that does not interact with matter as we know it and that astrophysicists have been studying since the 1970s. Radiating little or no detectable energy, dark matter is thought nevertheless to exert gravitational effects on surrounding bodies, and some scientists believe it played an important role in the formation of galaxies. According to some theories, the amount of dark matter in the Universe is a key element in determining if it will continue to expand or eventually start contracting.

Larger Role for RNA

For decades, cell scientists believed that proteins acting as enzymes carried out the functional activities in living tissue and that RNA acted only as a messenger

molecule (see 1956, Ribosomes and Transfer RNA). Then in the early 1980s American biologist Thomas Robert Cech (b. 1947) and Canadian-born biologist Sidney Altman (b. 1939) showed that a type of bacterial RNA they called a ribozyme could act like an enzyme and restructure itself. For their discovery, Cech and Altman won the 1989 Nobel Prize in Chemistry.

In the spring of 1992, American biologist Harry Francis Noller (b. 1939) eliminated the protein component from a ribosomal RNA to observe the effect as RNA encountered amino acids, the building blocks of protein. Acting alone, RNA was able to string together the amino acids. Also in 1991, Cech’s laboratory reported similar activity in ribozymes. This meant that RNA was more important in protein synthesis—and therefore more fundamental to the life process—than had been realized.
