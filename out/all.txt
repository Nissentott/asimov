Science in Prehistory
(4,000,000 B.C.—3500 B.C.)

The earliest human techno-
logical advances—the fash-
ioning of stone tools and
the capture of fire—were
made long before Homo sa-
piens sapiens (modern man)
evolved. Curiosity and need
drove our hominid ances-
tors to learn about the natu-
ral world and to use it to
their advantage—for food,
for warmth, for protection.
As early as 2,000,000 B.c.,
Homo habilis not only used
tools but also made them—
sharp-edged flints em-
ployed as knives, scrapers,
and the tips of spears.
Around 500,000 B.c., Homo
erectus, who had improved
on the first stone imple-
ments and was able to hunt
mammoths and other large
animals, learned how to
use fire. With the control of
this potent natural force,
early humans gained much
more than a source of
warmth; they could now
keep predators away and
clear land, cook food, and
dry hides and wood. Hornto
erectus also built the first
crude homes. Modern man

stepped onto the evolution-
ary stage about 50,000 B.c.
By 20,000 B.c., people had
invented oil lamps and
were hunting with bows
and arrows. By about
10,000 B.c., as the glaciers
of the most recent ice age
receded, human habitation
had expanded to nearly all
parts of the globe. In 10,000
B.C., the Earth's population
was approximately 3 mil-
lion. As the practice of herd-
ing animals increased and
as agriculture improved,
the number of humans
grew to about 5 million by
8000 B.c. It is from this
point on, a period of about
10,000 years, that civiliza-
tion as we know it has de-
veloped. The domestication
of animals (12,000 B.c.)
meant that hungry humans
no longer had to follow mi-
grating herds; they could
now decide where they
would live. The cultivation
of wheat and barley (8000
B.C.) gave them a food sup-
ply beyond the available
local vegetation, while irri-
gation (5000 B.c.) expanded

the areas suitable for grow-
ing. Around 7000 B.c., the
invention of pottery gave
rise to a new form of cook-
ing; instead of just roast-
ing, now there was boiling
—and the stew was born.
Pottery was eventually
made by a wheel, a device
that may have suggested
the wheeled cart, first used
around 3500 B.c. At roughly
the same time, ploughs pro-
vided a better way to pre-
pare the ground for
growing, and river boats ex-
panded the means and ease
of transport. The earliest
form of writing had evolved
by 3500 B.c. This innova-
tion was of monumental im-
portance. In the short term,
writing meant that records
could be kept, and it facili-
tated commerce and com-
munication. More
important, it allowed learn-
ing and literature to be ac-
cumulated and passed
down from generation to
generation. With the inven-
tion of writing, the era of re-
corded history began.

Bipedality

The first human advance
was biological. It consisted
of becoming human.

We might ask what
makes a human being
human. What part is suffi-
ciently Auman so that we
can at once point to it and
say, “This is human. With-
out it, this organism would
be something else.”

The human being of
today has, of course,
evolved many characteris-
tics that are now consid-
ered human, so many that
it is difficult to point to any
one of them and consider it
the key. What we must do,
then, is go back in time,
watching humanity become
more and more primitive,
less human, more apelike.

Yet we must stop at
some point where our an-
cestors are still more nearly
human than they are apish.
Any organism that is more
human than ape is called a
hominid (from a Latin word
for “man’’). Any organism
that is more ape than
human is called a pongid
(from a Congolese word for
“ape”’).

Therefore, we might re-
cast the first sentence of
this section to read “The

first hominid advance was
biological. It consisted of
becoming hominid.”

As we go back in time,
studying the bones and
teeth (all that remain) of
earlier forms of hominid
life, we come to an organ-
ism that was perhaps the
size of a modern chimpan-
zee or even a little smaller
and with a brain that was
no larger. Yet in one crucial
respect, it was much closer
to the human than to the
ape. This human character-
istic is so obvious that, if
we were to see the organ-
ism in real life, we would at
once say, “This is no ape.”

It was the first homi-
nid, and what made it so
was its bipedality. It
walked on two legs, as we
can tell from the shape of
its spinal column, its pelvic
girdle, and its thighbones.

The fact that human be-
ings walk on two legs
strikes us as characteristi-
cally human. We are bipeds
(from Latin words for “two
legs”), while other mam-
mals are quadrupeds (four
legs).

Of course birds walk,
run, or hop on two legs,
and the Greek philosopher
Plato (ca. 427—ca. 347 B.C.)
therefore defined a human

 

being as a “‘featherless
biped.” That is insufficient,
however, for there are bi-
peds with fur (kangaroos
and jerboas) and bipeds
with scales (various dino-
saurs), which Plato knew
nothing about.

Let’s consider bipe-
dality, then, to see what
makes human bipedality
different from other types.

Animals that are bipe-
dal are often restricted to
two legs because two others
have been devoted to some
other (and preferred) form
of locomotion. Most birds
are designed to be flyers,
and the forelegs have be-
come wings for that pur-
pose. Penguins are
swimmers, and the forelegs
have become flippers. In
either case, walking, run-
ning, or hopping is second-
ary.

There are, of course,
nonflying birds like os-
triches, for which walking
or running on two legs is
the only means of locomo-
tion. In such cases, the
body is designed for it and
is essentially horizontal, so
that there are roughly
equal amounts of it at front
and rear. With the two legs
centered, bipedality is a me-
chanically easy thing to

 
 

maintain. This is also true
of bipedal reptiles and
mammals like the tyranno-
saur and the kangaroo.
Long tails provide balance,
and the body remains essen-
tially horizontal.

Suppose, though, a
quadruped’s body ends at
the hips and there is no tail
to act as a balance. In that
case, the only way the
body'’s center of gravity can
be brought above the hind
legs is to tip the entire body
into a vertical position.

Some tailless animals
actually do this. Bears and
chimpanzees can stand up-
right on their hind legs and
even walk about in this
fashion, but they are
clearly uncomfortable
doing so and prefer to let
the forelegs share the work.
Penguins, too, hold their
bodies upright, but they are
swimmers and clumsy on
land. Though they can walk
long distances if they must,
they prefer to belly-whop
on ice when they can.

The human being,
then, is a tailless, habitual,
and comfortable biped. But
what is it that makes the
human a comfortable
walker on two legs?

It is that the spinal col-
umn, just above the pelvis,
bends backward in human
beings, assuming a shallow
S-shape and adding a
spring to the human walk
that makes it comfortable.

No other organism has that
backward bend of the spine
in the small of the back.
Bipedality also produces
problems. There are
slipped disks, inflamed si-
nuses, and accidental falls,
for instance. None of these
would be likely were it not
that human beings are still
not entirely adapted to
walking upright.)

The earliest hominids
were first identified by an
Australian-born South Afri-
can anthropologist, Ray-
mond Arthur Dart (1893—
1988), to whom a skull,
rather human-looking ex-
cept for its extraordinarily
small size, was brought
from a South African lime-
stone quarry in 1924. Dart,
in 1925, named the type of
organism to which the skull
belonged Australopithecus
(from Greek words mean-
ing “‘southern ape”). Fur-
ther finds made it clear
that it was not an ape but a
hominid, and at least four
different species have now
been identified, which are
lumped together as austra-
lopithecines.

In 1974 an American
anthropologist, Donald Jo-
hanson, unearthed an un-
precedentedly complete
and ancient skeleton of an
australopithecine female,
who was given the name
Lucy. (You can tell a female
from a male by the shape of
its pelvis.) [t was possibly

as much as four million
years old judging from the
age of the rocks in which it
was found.

Lucy is an example of
Australopithecus afarensis,
because Afars is the name
of the region in east-central
Africa where her remains
were found. Australopithe-
cines existed only in cast-
ern and southern Africa, so
east-central Africa may
have been the cradle of hu-
manity.

Lucy was the size of a
chimpanzee and slighter in
build. Her australopithe-
cine relatives seem to have
ranged between 3 and 4
feet in height and to have
weighed perhaps 65
pounds. Their brains were
no larger than a chimpan-
zee's and about a quarter
the size of our own.

The early australopith-
ecines probably lived much
as chimpanzees do, may
have spent their time
partly in trees, must have
been very largely vegetar-
ian, and undoubtedly could
not speak. However, they
were as bipedal as we are
and walked as casily and as
comfortably on their hind
legs as we do.

Why did the australo-
pithecines develop the
backward bend in the
spine? Why did the pro-
cesses of evolution invent
the hominid, in other
words?
 

 

 

Four million years ago
the Earth had been warm
for quite a while, and large
tropical animals, such as el-
ephants, rhinoceroses, and
hippopotamuses, tended to
lose their hair because such
insulation kept them too
warm. For some reason, the
hominids also lost their
hair though they were
much smaller than other
hairless mammals. We
don’t know at what stage
hair was lost.

The Earth of the austra-
lopithecines was turning
cooler, however. The forests
shrank and were replaced
by grasslands. Those organ-
isms whose habitat was the
forest and who did not give
up the trees naturally re-
treated with the forest.

Some arboreal prehom-
inids managed to adapt to
the grasslands in east-cen-
tral Africa and to spend
more and more time out of
the trees. It must have been
a difficult transition. As
they spent more time on

 

the ground, they had an in-
creasing tendency to rise to
their hind legs and peer
about over the tall grass,
searching for food or watch-
ing out for predators. Those
who could stand upright
more easily and could do so
for longer intervals were
better able to survive.

Even a slight crook in
the spine, which made
standing upright slightly
easier, gave those who had
it a better chance of surviv-
ing, and of having children
to inherit that crook. What
we call natural selection
would thus drive the pre-
hominids toward bipe-
dality and a true hominid
character.

Bipedality had side ef-
fects that were also benefi-
cial and that reinforced the
natural-selection drive. The
forelimbs were freed for
duty as something other
than support. The freed
hands could more easily
manipulate portions of the
environment, feel them,

2,000,000 B.C.

and bring them close to the
eyes, ears, and nose, so that
the brain was continually
flooded with sensations.

Any change that made
the brain a bit larger or
more complex made it pos-
sible for the brain to handle
the flood of sensation more
efficiently, and this led to
an improved chance of sur-
vival. Thus, natural selec-
tion introduced a drive for
bigger and better brains.

The early australopith-
ecines, with a brain as large
as that of a chimpanzee but
with a body that was
slighter, already had a
larger brain-to-body ratio
than any pongid then or
since. Since the brain-to-
body ratio is a crucial fac-
tor in what we call intelli-
gence (provided the brain is
reasonably large), the aus-
tralopithecines were proba-
bly the most intelligent
land animals existing in
their time.

 

Stone Tools

Sometimes, we think of the
human being as a tool-
using animal. Tool-using is
not really unique to human
beings, however. For exam-

ple, sea otters routinely
smash shellfish against a
rock they carry for the pur-
pose on their abdomens as
they float belly-up. A long
litany of other examples
could also be given.

If we change that to
tool-making animal, we are
somewhat better off, but
not entirely. Chimpanzees
have been seen to strip
leaves from twigs and then
use the bare twigs as de-
vices for capturing ter-
mites, which to them are
tasty snacks.

Undoubtedly, australo-
pithecines could do any-
thing that chimpanzees
could do. We have no evi-
dence, but we can be fairly
certain that they used tree
branches and long bones as
clubs. They could surely
throw rocks or use them as
sea otters do.

The australopithecines
may have existed on Earth
for three million years, not
becoming finally extinct till
as late as 1,000,000 B.c. For
the final third of their exis-
tence, though, they were no
longer the only hominids.
Some australopithecines
had evolved to the point
where they had become suf-
ficiently human to be
placed in the same genus
with ourselves.

About two million
years ago, in other words,
genus Homo came into
existence. For a time, it co-
existed with the australo-
pithecines, but there was
bound to be conflict be-
tween them, and in this,
the larger and brainier
hominids won out, contrib-
uting (very largely, per-
haps) to the extinction of
the australopithecines.

In the 1960s, the En-
glish anthropologist Louis
Seymour Bazett Leakey
(1903—1972), his wife,
Mary, and their son, Jona-

than, located remains of
the oldest of the genus
Homo in the Olduvai
Gorge, in what is now Tan-
zania. The hominids thus
uncovered were named
Homo habilis (Latin for
“able man," because with
them were discovered ob-
jects that seemed to indi-
cate that they made simple
stone tools).

Homwo habilis was
smaller than some of the
larger species of australo-
pithecines. When, in the
summer of 1986, fossil re-
mains of Homo habilis were
discovered that were some
1.8 million years old (the
first time that both skull
fragments and limb bones
of the same individual of
that species had been lo-
cated), they seemed to rep-
resent a small, light adult
about 3'» feet tall and with
arms that were surprisingly
long.

Though members of
Homo habilis may have
been small, they had more
rounded heads than any of
the australopithecines and
larger brains, nearly half as
large as those of modern
human beings. They had
thinner skull bones, and
based on the brain configu-
ration, if they could not
talk, they could at least
make a greater variety of
sounds. Their hands were
more like our modern
hands, and their feet were

completely modern. Their
jaws were less massive, so
that their faces looked less
apelike.

These creatures appar-
ently used stone tools to
chip pieces of {lint and so
create a sharp edge. This
meant that for the first
time, hominids had sharp
edges in quantity and did
not have to depend on the
chance finding of one. More-
over the edges could be
made truly sharp, and the
sharpness could be re-
newed when the rock was
blunted.

These stone knives in-
creased the food supply.
Homo habilis could not tear
away at the tough hides of
animals, as fanged preda-
tors such as the various
cats, dogs, and bears could.
Without knives, hominids
had to make do with car-
casses that had already
been mangled by other
predators and to make off
with what they could scav-
enge.

With knives, however,
Homo habilis had artificial
fangs that could slit hides
and scrape the meat off
hides and bones. What's
more, Homo habilis no
longer had to scavenge.
Hominids could now kill
animals on their own, even
fairly large animals. And
once they caught on to the
trick of tying stone axes to
wooden branches and creat-
 

ing the first crude spears,
they could stab animals at
a distance. If the spears
were thrown, the distance
could be made long enough

500,000 B.C.

to obviate immediate retali-
ation.

Hominids became
hunters and killed off the
competing australopithe-

cines, no doubt, so that for
the last million years, all
hominids, without excep-
tion, have been part of
genus Homo.

 

Fire

By 1,600,000 B.c., Homo ha-
bilis was gone. For one
thing, it had evolved into a
new species, Homo erectus,
with members about as
large and as heavy as mod-
ern human beings. If any ex-
amples of Homo habilis
existed after the new spe-
cies had established itself,
they didn'’t last long.

Between 1,000,000 B.c.
and 300,000 B.c., Homo
erectus was the only homi-
nid in existence. It was the
first hominid that could, in
some cases, attain a height
of as much as 6 feet and
weigh over 150 pounds. The
brain was larger, too, some-
times three-fourths as
heavy as that of modern
human beings.

Homo erectus made
much better stone tools
than had been made before.
As hunters, its members
were capable of taking on
the biggest animals they
could find. They were the
first hominids who could
hunt mammoths success-
fully.

Homo erectus made

two particularly enormous
advances.

All the hominids, for as
much as three and a half
million years, had been con-
fined to the southeastern
half of Africa. Homo erectus
was the first hominid to ex-
pand that range signifi-
cantly. By 500,000 B.c.
Homo erectus had moved
into the rest of Africa, into
Europe and Asia, and even
into the Indonesian islands.

In fact, the first discov-
eries of the remains of
Homo erectus were made on
the Indonesian island of
Java, where the Dutch an-
thropologist Marie Eugene
Dubois (1858—-1940) discov-
ered a skullcap, a femur,
and two teeth in 1894. No
hominid with so small a
brain had yet been discov-
ered, and Dubois named it
Pithecanthropus erectus
(from Greek words mean-
ing “‘erect ape-man’’).

Similar finds were
made near Peking, begin-
ning in 1927, by a Canadian
anthropologist, Davidson
Black (1884-1934). He
named his hominid
Sinanthropus pekinensis

(Greek for ““Chinaman from
Peking”’).

Eventually it was rec-
ognized that both sets of re-
mains, along with others,
were of the same species
and deserved to belong to
genus Homo. Dubois’s term
erectus was kept, even
though hominids had been
walking erect for at least
two and a half million
years before Homo erectus
had evolved. This was not
known in Dubois’s time,
however.

By the time Homo
erectus had evolved, the
Earth was in a glacial pe-
riod. When the glaciers
were at their peak, they
withdrew so much water
from the sea that the sea
level dropped as much as
300 feet, exposing the conti-
nental shelves under the
shallow sections. It was
this that made it possible
for Homo erectus to wander
from the Asian continent to
the Indonesian islands.

The cold weather en-
forced new habits. Homo
erectus traveled in bands,
as earlier hominids must
have, but made shelters by

 

 
 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

building up stones to break
the wind, or by suspending
hides from a central pole.
These were the first crude
homes. Where caves ex-
isted, Homo erectus found
shelter there. The first
traces of Homo erectus in
Asia (Black’s findings near
Peking) were in a filled-up
cave.

The cave near Peking
had traces of campfires.
This meant that fire had
been “discovered”” some
five hundred thousand
years ago. Here is a charac-
teristic that marks off
human beings from all
other organisms. Every
human society in existence,
however primitive, has un-
derstood and made use of
fire. No living creature
other than human beings
uses fire in even the most
primitive fashion.

I have put discovered in
quotation marks, for fire
was not discovered in the
usual sense. Lightning
could start a fire ever since
Earth’s atmosphere gained
enough oxygen to sustain
one and Earth's land sur-
face possessed a forest
cover that could burn, and
that means for some four
hundred million years.
From that fire, then as now,
any animal capable of flee-
ing would flee.

By the discovery of fire,
then, we really mean its
taming. At some time,
Homo erectus learned how

to retrieve some burning
object from the edge of a
naturally caused fire, keep
the fire alive by feeding it
judicious amounts of fuel
whenever it showed signs
of dying down, and make
good use of it.

How this happened we
don’t know. My own guess
is that it began when chil-
dren grew fascinated by
leaping flames. With their
overactive curiosity, and
with the lack of bitter expe-
rience of what happens
when one is burnt, they
might be more likely to
play with it than adults
would be. Presumably, the
nearest adult would snatch
the child away from the fire
and stamp it out. On the
other hand, the time might
come when an adult, more
venturesome than most,
might see the advantage of
continuing the play in a
more purposeful manner.

The use of fire changed
human life completely. For
one thing, it gave light in
the dark and warmth at
any time. This made it pos-
sible to extend activity into
nighttime and winter,
which would be particu-
larly important in a glacial
period for it meant Homo
erectus could extend its
range into the cooler re-
gions.

Of course with fire
alone one is condemned in
cold weather to hug the
hearth, but a hunting soci-

ety could easily get the no-
tion of scraping an animal
hide clean and wrapping
oneselfin it. In this way, an-
imal fur would replace the
hair human beings had
lost.

Fire was also useful as
a means of protection from
other animals, even the
fiercest. A fire in a cave or
within a circle of stones
would keep the predators
away. They might snarl
and slink about the out-
skirts, but if they were not
intelligent enough to stay
away from fire, one experi-
ence of its nearness was all
they would need. In fact,
Homo erectus could now
carry burning branches to
scare game and send it
stampeding into traps and
off cliffs.

Then, too, fire made it
possible to cook food. This
is more important than
might appear. Meat is ten-
derer and tastier if roasted.
What's more, roasting kills
parasites and bacteria so
that the meat is safer to
eat. Eventually fire made
plant food, otherwise inedi-
ble, supremely edible. Try
eating rice fresh from the
stalk, or uncooked grain of
any kind, and you'll under-
stand what a little applica-
tion of heat from a fire can
do.

Finally, fire made possi-
ble various chemical
changes in inanimate mat-
ter, such as the smelting of
 

o

metals. In short, fire intro-
duced humanity’s first age
of comparatively “high-
tech.”

To begin with, of
course, fire could be ob-
tained only after it had
been started by natural
means. Once one had a fire,
it had to be kept burning
continuously, and if it ever
died out, the search for an-
other fire had to be insti-
tuted at once. If there was
not a nearby tribe from

200,000 B.C.

 

which fire could be ob-
tained (assuming they were
friendly enough to grant it
—and they probably would
be, for it might be their
turn next) then it would be
necessary to wait for a natu-
ral fire again and hope that
conditions would be such
that some could be taken
safely.

The time came, how-
ever, when techniques were
developed for starting a fire
where none had been be-

fore. This could be done by
friction: by turning a
pointed stick in a depres-
sion in another stick, a de-
pression that contained
very dry shreds of wood,
leaves, or fungus (tinder).
The heat of friction might
eventually ignite the tinder.
We don'’t know when such
methods were first devel-
oped, but the technique for
starting a fire represents an-
other enormous step for-
ward.

 

Religion

By 200,000 B.c., the last in-
dividuals who might be
considered members of
Homo erectus were dead

and the species was extinct.

By then, though, some had
evolved into hominids
whose brains were every
bit as large as ours, al-
though they were some-
what differently
proportioned, less massive
in front and more massive
in the rear. They had first
appeared not long before
this time and were proba-
bly instrumental in bring-
ing about the end of the
older species.

The first traces of such
hominids were discovered
in 1856, in the valley of the
Neander River in western

Germany. Neander Valley
is Neanderthal in German,
and the skeletal remains
were referred to as Neander-
thal man at first, or simply
Neanderthals.

These were the first
hominids to be discovered.
They were clearly different
from modern human be-
ings. Their skulls were dis-
tinctly less human than our
own. They had pronounced
eyebrow ridges, large teeth,
protruding jaws, and reced-
ing foreheads and chins.

Because they were the
first hominids to be discov-
ered, and because the West-
ern world still believed
strongly that the Earth was
only a few thousand years
old (as the Bible seemed to
imply), there was a certain
reluctance to accept the Ne-

anderthal bones as remains
of an early form of Homo sa-
piens. Some preferred to
consider them remains of
ordinary members of Homo
sapiens who were suffering
from some sort of bone dis-
ease or other abnormality.

When more examples
of Neanderthal skeletons
were found and all had the
same kind of skulls, how-
ever, the notion of abnor-
mality could not be
maintained. The French an-
thropologist Paul Broca
(1824—1880) marshalled the
arguments in favor of Nean-
derthals being a more prim-
itive form of life than we
ourselves, and that turned
the tide.

The formal name for
the Neanderthals was at
first Homo neandertha-

 

 

 
 

 

 

lensis, but they were so like
us in all but a few details of
the skull that they were fi-
nally recognized as being of
our species. And why not?
There is evidence that they
may have interbred with
human beings of the pres-
ent type. They are now re-
ferred to as Homo sapiens
neanderthalensis and are
considered one of the two
known subspecies of Homo
sapiens. We moderns are
the other.

The Neanderthals lived
from 200,000 B.c. to 30,000

B.C. in Africa and Eurasia.
They lived during glacial
times and hunted the mam-
moth, the woolly rhinoc-
eros, and the giant cave
bear. Their stone tools were
greater in variety and more
delicate and precise than
had ever been seen before.
They definitely knew how
to start fires.

They were the first
hominids to bury their
dead. Earlier hominids, like
animals generally, simply
left their dead lying where
they had fallen so that they

were scavenged by preda-
tors and what was left over
rotted. The fact that Nean-
derthals buried their dead,
thus preserving them from
scavengers, if not from
decay bacteria, tends to
show that they valued life
somehow, felt affection,
and eared for individuals.
Sometimes the dead were
old and crippled and could
only have lived as long as
they did with the loving
help of others of the tribe.

What's more, food and
flowers were often buried
with the corpse, and this
seems to indicate that Ne-
anderthals felt life contin-
ued on an individual basis
after death. If they felt that
there was life after death,
then this might indicate the
first stirrings of what we
can call religion—a [eeling
that there is more to the
Universe than is apparent
to the senses.
 

20,000 B.C.

 

Art

Sometime after 50,000 B.c.,
a variety of Neanderthal ex-
isted with less pronounced
eyebrow ridges, even in
male adults, with a high
forehead and a distinct
chin, and with smaller
teeth. In short, this was the
kind of hominid, quite ex-
actly, that we are. We are
Homo sapiens sapiens, and
we are sometimes referred
to as modern man, though
modern human beings is
more appropriate terminol-
ogy to make it clear that
men, women, and children
are meant and not only
men.

Between 50,000 B.c.
and 30,000 B.c., the two va-
rieties of Homo sapiens co-
existed, but by the latter
date, some interbreeding
and probably a great deal
of slaughter had put an end
to the Neanderthals, so that
for the last thirty thousand
years or so, all living homi-
nids have been of the mod-
ern type.

Modern human beings
were extremely successful.
For the first time, they ex-
tended the range beyond
where Homo erectus had
left it. Between 40,000 B.c.
and 30,000 B.c., human be-
ings took advantage of the

existence of land bridges
that the fall in sea level had
produced. They entered
Australia from southeast-
ern Asia, and North
America from northeastern
Asia. No hominids had ex-
isted in either continent be-
fore. They also found their
way to the Japanese is-
lands.

The new lands were
steadily overrun, and by
10,000 B.c. human beings
had reached the southern-
most part of South
America, and even Tierra
del Fuego, the island to the
south of that continent. All
the continental areas ex-
cept Antarctica and the gla-
ciated areas in the north
were settled.

Human beings were
hunters, of course, and they
had developed rituals to im-
prove their success. One,
apparently, was to draw
pictures of animals being
successfully hunted, in the
conviction, perhaps, that
life would imitate art, or
that the spirits that ani-
mated animals would be
mollified in this way and
would cooperate.

In 1879, a Spanish ar-
chaeologist, Marcellino de
Sautuola (d. 1888), was ex-
cavating Altamira Cave in
northern Spain, when his

twelve-year-old daughter,
who was with him, spied
paintings on the ceiling and
cried out “‘Bulls! Bulls!”
There were paintings of
bison, deer, and other ani-
mals in red and black,
drawn perhaps as long ago
as 20,000 B.c.

The drawings spoke
highly of the artists’ skill. If
anything were needed to
show that early human be-
ings were our intellectual
equals, this would do. In
the last twenty millennia,
we have gained enormous
knowledge and experience,
but we are not one whit
more human than those an-
cient cave artists.

So excellent was the
art, in fact, that many peo-
ple refused to believe it was
truly ancient. Many felt it
to be a fraud of some sort, a
modern hoax. It was only
with the finding of other
caves and other cave paint-
ings that the art was finally
accepted as ancient.

The cave paintings
were found in remote
places and were invisible
except by artificial light, so
that it is believed they were
drawn for religious and rit-
ualistic purposes rather
than for display. Neverthe-

less, they are clearly the re-

sult of infinite pains, and it

 

 

 
 

 

 

 

is hard to believe that the
artists did not derive joy
from their work.

Bows and
Arrows

In some of the early art,
there are clear depictions of
bows and arrows being
used. How old the bow and
arrow are is uncertain, but
they were in use by 20,000
B.C. at least.

The bow and arrow is
an important device be-
cause it is the first one in-
vented by human beings in
which energy is slowly
stored and then released all
at once. It made possible at-
tack from a greater dis-
tance than with a thrown
spear and so was the first
truly long-distance weapon.

12,000 B.C.

The value of attacking an
infuriated animal much
larger than yoursell from as
great a distance as possible
is clear.

Bows and arrows were
eventually used by humans
against other humans (as
has been true of any object
capable of inflicting dam-
age, no matter what the
purpose for which it might
originally have been de-
signed). The bow remained
a prime weapon in warfare
right down to the begin-
ning of the fifteenth cen-
tury.

Oil Lamps

A campfire of burning wood
or brush gives light, but it
is not portable. It cannot
give light precisely where
that light might be needed.

Wood, however, is not the
only possible fuel. People
when roasting meat might
well have noticed that the
fat dripped and flamed.

A smaller fire, then, in
more concentrated form,
might be obtained by dip-
ping some porous wood in
oil and setting it ablaze,
thus forming a torch. Still
more convenient would be
some oil in a container
(a hollowed-out stone, for
instance) with a wick of
some plant fiber inserted
into it. The oil would soak
into the wick and would
burn at its end. It could be
carried from place to place
to suit one's needs.

There are indications
that primitive lamps of this
sort may have been in use
as long ago as 20,000 B.c.

 

Animal
Domestication

In the 1950s, fossil remains
of dogs were found along
with remains of humans in
caves near Kirkuk in what
is now northern Iraq. They
dated from about 12,000
B.C.

How dogs came to be
domesticated is not known,
of course. My own guess is
that, again, children were

| B

responsible. A child could
form a close bond with a
puppy that had been found
abandoned, or that was left
over when the mother was
killed either in self-defense
or for food. Once the bond
was formed, the child
would object strenuously to
the use of the puppy as
food, and parents might
oblige.

It would quickly have
turned out that dogs, being
hunters and pack animals,

will accept a human master
as the pack leader. Dogs
would go hunting with
their masters, help in kill-
ing the game, wait for the
human beings to take what
they wanted, and be satis-
fied to be thrown a minor
share.

In this way human be-
ings, for the first time, ob-
tained the services of
another species of animal.

By 10,000 8.c., another
step had been taken, with
 

the domestication of goats
in the Middle East. The
goats would be cared for,
fed, and encouraged to re-
produce. They would sup-
ply milk, butter, and cheese
and, by dint of judicious
culling, meat. What’s more,

8000 B.C.

Agriculture

Human beings led a no-
madic life. As long as hunt-
ing was a major source of
food, they had to be pre-
pared to follow migrating
herds of animals. Even if
they lived on plants and on
nonmigrating animals, a
tribe lingering in one place
too long would consume
the available food and have
to move elsewhere for fresh
foraging.

Even when human be-
ings became herders, they
remained nomads. The
herds had to be taken to
fresh pastures now and
then, either because of sea-
sonal changes or because of
overgrazing.

About 8000 B.c., how-
ever, in the same region
where animals were first
domesticated, something
new arrived, heralding a

 

since goats eat grass and
other substances humans
find inedible, the food sup-
ply was increased at no
cost. (Dogs have to be given
food that would otherwise
fill human stomachs.)

Until then, people had

change greater than any
since the first use of fire.

What it amounted to
was that plants were do-
mesticated. Somehow it oc-
curred to human beings to
plant seeds deliberately, to
wait for them to grow, to
water them, and to wait for
them to ripen while de-
stroying competing plants.
Then the plants could be
harvested and would serve
as food.

1t was tedious and
back-breaking work, but
the net result was that a
great deal of food could be
obtained, far more than by
hunting and gathering, or
even herding, since plant
life is more copious than an-
imal life.

The coming of herding
and agriculture, particu-
larly agriculture, meant
that a given area of land
could support a larger pop-

found their food by hunting
and gathering, with all the
insecurities attendant on
that. Herding provided a
much more secure food
supply.

ulation than before. There
was less starvation, more
children survived, and the
population increased.

Agriculture began in
northern Iraq where wheat
and barley grew wild, and
it was these that were do-
mesticated. The kernels of
grain could be ground into
flour that could be stored
for months on end without
spoiling and could be
baked into a tasty and nu-
tritious bread.

Despite the increase in
the food supply, farmers
must have been very con-
scious of their labor, a kind
of slavery foisted upon
them, which even the use of
animals didn’t much miti-
gate. The tale of the Garden
of Eden in the Bible may be
the product of farmers who
remembered with nostalgia
a kind of “golden age”
when human beings hunted

 
 

and gathered in freedom
and comparative idleness
and wondered what had
happened to evict them
from this Elysium and
force them to earn their
bread by the sweat of their
brow.

Then too, Adam'’s first
two sons were depicted as
Abel, a herder, and Cain, a
farmer. The farmers in-
creased in population faster
than the herders did, and
we can well imagine that
areas devoted to farming
spread and steadily took up
space that had earlier been
freely used by herders. (The
same thing happened in the
American West, when the
farmers settled the land
and fenced in their plots to
the discomfiture of the no-
madic cowboys.) No won-
der the Bible pictures Cain
as killing Abel.

Agriculture, for the
first time, condemned
human beings to a seden-
tary existence. Once a farm
was established, there
could be no further wander-
ing. The farmers had to re-
main with the farm, which
was fixed in one place.

A sedentary life had its
dangers. As long as human
beings hunted and gath-
ered, or even herded, dan-
ger could be avoided. If a
hungry, marauding tribe
approached, intent on tak-
ing what food they could
find, the tribe already pres-

ent, if they decided fighting
would be too dangerous,
could always flee.

Farmers could not run,
at Jeast not without aban-
doning their farms and
seeing their lifework ruined
and themselves faced with
starvation. Once the popu-
lation had increased,
thanks to agriculture, they
could not possibly find
enough food to maintain
themselves except by con-
tinuing with agriculture—
they had a tiger by the tail.

Farmers therefore had
to be prepared to fight at
whatever cost, and they
gathered together for mu-
tual self-protection. They
would find a site on an ele-
vation (so that they could
throw missiles downward,
whereas an enemy would
have to throw them up-
ward, with lesser effect)
and with a secure water
supply (you can go without
food for a period of time
but not without water).
There they would build
houses and surround them
with a protective wall. The
result would be a city, and
the inhabitants would be
city-dwellers, or citizens.

In northern Iragq, for in-
stance, near the site where
herding and agriculture de-
veloped, are the remains of
a very ancient city, founded
perhaps in 8000 B.c., at a
site called Jarmo. It is a
low mound into which, be-

ginning in 1948, the Ameri-
can archaeologist Robert J.
Braidwood dug carefully.
He found the remains of
houses built with thin walls
of packed mud and divided
into small rooms. The city
may have held no more
than a hundred to three
hundred people, but cities
grew rapidly larger.

Agriculture made it
possible for farmers to pro-
duce more food than their
own families needed. This
meant that pes; ‘¢ could do
things other than farming
—for example, engage in ar-
tisanry or art—and trade
their products for some of a
farmer’s excess food. For
the first time, human be-
ings could find time to
think of something other
than the next meal. In addi-
tion, living in close quar-
ters in a city, they could
interact easily, and the in-
novations and ideas of one
could be rapidly transmit-
ted to the others.

As a result, the coming
of agriculture and of cities
meant the coming also of a
new and more complex
way of life, which we call
civilization (from a Latin
word for “city-dweller”).
The civilized area was
small at first, but it spread
outward steadily until it
now occupies virtually the
entire world.
 

7000 B.C.

 

Pottery

It has always been im-
portant for human beings
to carry things, and the ob-
vious way to carry them is
in the hands, or in the
crook of the arm. There is a
limit to how much can be
carried in this fashion, how-
ever. What we needed were
artificial hands, so to speak,
that were considerably
larger than our natural
hands.

Objects could be car-
ried in hides, but hides are
an inconvenient shape and
heavy. Gourds might do,
but they have to be taken
as they come. Eventually
human beings learned to
weave twigs or other fibers
into baskets. These were
light and could be made in
any shape.

Baskets, however, were
only useful in carrying

solid, dry objects made up
of particles considerably
larger than the interstices
of the weave. Baskets could
not be used to carry flour or
olive oil, for instance, or
most important, water.

It might seem natural
to daub baskets with clay,
which upon drying would
cake the holes and make
the basket solid. The dried
mud would tend to fall
away, however, especially
if the basket was shaken or
struck. But if the basket
was placed in the sun and
allowed to bake in direct
sunlight, the mud would
harden further, and the bas-
ket might then become
fairly serviceable for car-
rying powders and fluids.

But then why use the
basket? Why not simply
begin with clay, mold a con-
tainer out of it, and let it
dry in the sun? You would

then have a pot made of
crude earthenware, and
some of these may have
been formed as early as
9000 B.c. Such pots are soft,
however, and don't last
long.

Some stronger heat
was required. When earth-
enware was placed in the
fire, it became hard pottery,
and such pottery can be
traced back to perhaps
7000 B.c. This may have
been the first use of fire for
something other than light,
heat, and cooking.

Pottery not only made
it possible to carry liquids,
it also introduced a new
form of cooking. Until then,
food had usually been
roasted, exposed directly to
the flames or to dry heat.
Once a pot existed that
could hold water and with-
stand the heat of flames,
food could be heated in the
 

water—it could be boiled.

In this way stews and casse-

roles came into existence

And of course pottery
could be decorated and
well shaped. Cleverly decor
ated examples would be in
special demand. Artisans
could exchange them for
other material they found
needful. And since pottery
lasts indefinitely, if well
cared for, it can change
hands often, and one group
of people can use it in trad-
ing with another group

In early pottery, the
clay was pressed and

pounded into the shape of a
pot and the result was
something quite lumpy and
asymmetric but service-
able.

If the pot could be
turned, however, a rela-
tively light pressure from
the hand would produce a
symmetrical cylindrical
shape, and by appropriate
increases in pressure or by
downward pushes, compli-
cated modifications of the
basic cylinder could be
made while retaining sym-
metry. This could be done
if the clay was placed on a

 

horizontal, circular slab of
wood or stone (a patter
wheel), which had a central

spike underneath that

 

could be balanced in a de
pression and the whole
turned rapidly

The potter’s wheel was

 

one of the first examples ol
the use of a wheel and onge
of the first uses of rotary

motion. We don't
when it was first used, but
it may have led to the idea
of wh

Linen

Flax produces a fiber that
can be interwoven much as
twigs or bark might be in-
terwoven to form a basket.
To make a strong thread, a
number of flax fibers would
be twisted together. We call
the result linen. (Like the
word linen, the word line
comes from the word for
" fax,”)

The first use of linen,
perhaps as early as 6000
B.C., was to produce linen

cords that could be used in
fishing. Interweaving these
cords produced nets
Eventually very fine
nets were made—in other
words, cloth,
(from a Latin word for
“weaving"). The formation
of cloth from linen and
eventually from other plant

and animal fibers, such as

then, furred hides had been
worn. These were all right
in cold temperatures but

too hot at other times. They
weren 't porous, they were
heavy, and they smelled

hand, were light, flexible

rial for clothing ever since

would cluster near rivers
and lakes for that purpose.
Water would offer
them a source of food, too,
and they would venture out
into it to catch fish. People
would learn to swim. In ad-
dition, they could not help
but notice that wood floats.
By 6000 B.c., they must
have learned how to lash
logs together to form rafts
that would keep them out
on the surface of quiet bod-
ies of water for a time. By
paddling with their hands,
if nothing else, they could
even cross small stretches

of water.

Sickles

Human beings had to in-
vent devices that would be
of help in dealing with the
plants they were trying to
exploit. The ripe stalks of
grain would have to be cut
down, and as early as 6000
B.C., sickles (from a Latin
word meaning ‘‘to cut”)
were used for that purpose.
They were essentially
knives (originally of sharp-
ened stone) at the end of
sticks, which could be used
to slash at the base of the
stalks.

Once the stalks were

cut down, the grain could
be rubbed between two
stones to eliminate the
chaff and reduce the starch
to powder. One stone
would have a depression
into which the grain could
be poured, and the other
would be rounded and
could be used for grinding,
impelled by muscle power.
Such a hand-mill is called a
quern.

 

5000 B.C.

 

Irrigation
Agriculture requires a
steady supply of water to
keep the plants alive, so it
naturally started where
rainfall could be counted
upon to a reasonable ex-
tent. Rainfall, however,
even at best, is a chancy
thing, and droughts are all
too common.

One reliable source of
fresh water (the salt water
of the sea won't work) is a

sizable river. Farms there-
fore began to develop along
riverbanks.

Whereas rain falls di-
rectly on the crops, how-
ever, river water generally
remains within its banks.
In order to correct that situ-
ation, it is necessary to dig
ditches so that water will
flow outward from the river
and soak the ground in
which the plants are grow-
ing. These ditches have to
be kept in order and not al-

lowed either to silt up or to
overflow.

What'’s more, when the
river’s water level falls dur-
ing a drought, the ditches
have to be dug deeper. And
since the river occasionally
rises in periods of heavier-
than-usual rains (not neces-
sarily at the site of the
farms, but many miles
away, nearer the river's
source), levees have to be
built to confine the rising
water within the banks.
 

 

 

These have to be tended
continually to prevent leaks
and breakdowns.

All this irrigation (from
Latin words meaning "'to
water inward’’) more or
less guarantees a good har-
vest and an ample food sup-
ply, at the cost of
unremitting labor.

This labor cannot be
done alone, nor can it be
done by various people,
each in his or her own way
and at his and her own
time. Irrigation requires co-
operation. Many farms de-
pend upon it, and the labor
of many has to be super-
vised to make a coherent
whole, so that the levees
are in good shape every-
where.

As a result, the farms
depend upon control by ca-
pable leaders who can su-
pervise the work and allot
the tasks, encourage the in-
dustrious and capable, and

4000 B.C.

punish the idle or incompe-
tent. In short, irrigation
leads to the formation of
what we call government, so
that a cluster of farms sur-
rounding a defensible city
becomes a city-state, with a
ruler and established rules
of behavior.

The first such city-
states formed along the
lower courses of the Eu-
phrates and Tigris rivers in
what is now southern Iraq
(but was then known as
Sumeria) about 5000 B.c.
Other city-states developed
at nearly the same time
along the Nile River in
Egypt. It almost never
rains in Egypt, but the Nile
remains a reliable water
supply and overflows regu-
larly once a year when the
rainy season takes place far
to the south, nearer its
source. The Nile (lood de-
posits fertile mud over the
farms on its banks.

Scales

Trade is bound to lead 1o
measurement—so much of
this for so much of that.
You can heft things by
hand, but that is subjective
and buyer and seller will
never agree. The easiest
way to be abjective is 1o
hang two pans from oppo-
site ends of a rod that is
held up in the middle. The
thing being weighed is
placed in one pan, and stan-
dard weights are placed in
the other until the two pans
are in balance. The princi-
ple is so simple and the de-
vice itself so easy to make
that it may have been used
as early as 5000 B.c. in
Egypt and have been rea-
sonably accurate.

 

Copper

From the early days of
Homo habilis 1o 4000 B.c. or
thereabouts, a period of
two million years, tools and
weapons were made of
stone, wood, or bone. Stone
is the most durable of these
and the most likely to re-
main as evidence of long-

past human activity. As a
result, that long period is
known as the Stone Age, a
term first used by the
Roman poet Titus Lucre-
tius Carus (95-55 B.c.) and
reintroduced by a Danish

archacologist, Christian Jiir-

gensen Thomsen (1788-
1865), in 1834.
The Stone Age is di-

vided into the Paleolithic,
the Mesolithie, and the Neo-
lithic (from Latin words
meaning “Old Stone,"”
“"Middle Stone,” and " New
Stone," respectively) based
on advancing techniques of
handling the stone.
Occasionally, thougl,
pebbles that were not like
other pebbles must have
 

v

been found by Stene Age
people. For one thing, these
occasional odd pebbles
were shiny and were heav-
ier than ordinary pebbles of
that size. What's more, if
these shiny pebbles were
struck with a stone ham-
mer, they did not split or
shatter as ordinary pebbles
did, but they distorted.
These occasional peb-
bles were metals. Dozens of
different metals are known,
but most of them remain in
combination with nonme-
tallic substances, and rocky
substances are the result.
Only those metals that are
inert and tend not to com-
bine with other substances
are likely to be found in a
free state. The three inert
metals most likely to be
found free are rather rare
even for metals. These are
copper, silver, and gold.
Their rareness is shown by
the fact that the very word
metal is from a Greek term
meaning ‘‘to search for.”
Metal nuggets exist
that were dealt with by
human beings as long ago
as 5000 B.c. or even earlier.
Because of their metallic
luster and the fact that they
can be beaten into interest-
ing shapes, they were used
at first almost exclusively
as ornaments. Of these,
gold was the most desired,
for it was the most beauti-
ful in color (a gleaming yel-

low), the heaviest, and the
most inert. It simply
doesn’t change with time.
Silver, a very light yellow,
tends to darken with time,
and copper, which is red-
dish, may even turn green.
(Copper is from the word
for Cyprus, the island that
served as an early source of
the metal.)

It was only when
human beings discovered
that metals could be ob-
tained from special rocks
called ores that metals be-
came common enough to
use for other purposes. Of
these, the first to be discov-
ered was copper. Copper is
combined with oxygen, car-
bon, or both in certain
rocky ores, and the discov-
ery that copper could be ob-
tained from them in pure
form took place about
4000 B.C.

Undoubtedly it was ac-
cidental at first. A fierce
wood fire might be built on
such copper ore. Under the
heat of the fire, the carbon
in the wood and in the ore
would combine with the ox-
ygen in the ore to form the
gas carbon dioxide, which
would escape, leaving me-
tallic copper behind. Some
observant person might no-
tice the reddish globules
among the ashes of the fire,
and eventually the circum-
stances would be under-
stood and the ores searched

for and deliberately heated.
In this way fire made
possible metallurgy—the
obtaining of metals from
their ores.

Copper ornaments be-
came more common there-
after, but copper could not
be used as a tool, though
one might think it could.
After all, a sharp-edged
piece of rock, if chipped,
loses its edge, and this can-
not be restored without la-
borious chipping. If a
sharp-edged piece of metal
is blunted, it can simply
and easily be beaten sharp
again. However, copper
was too easily blunted. It
couldn'’t very well be
beaten after every minor
use.

Sundials

From very early times, peo-
ple could count the days as
a measure of time, but they
often desired to measure
parts of days as well. One
way of doing so was to note
the progress of the Sun
from east to west. The mo-
tion seems to take place at
a steady speed.

Of course, one can't
stare at the Sun, but it is
the easiest thing in the

Bronze

Copper obtained from some
ores is harder than from
others. The reason is that
copper ore is not necessar-
ily pure; it may be mixed
with other substances that,
on being heated, combine
with copper to form an
alloy.

One such mixture con-
sists of copper and arsenic,
but arsenic is poisonous,
and people who worked
with it must have fallen
sick. Such mixed ores were
therefore abandoned
(perhaps the first known
case in which worker

safety was a factor in tech-
nology).

Fortunately, another
type of ore mixture was dis-
covered that also resulted
in the smelting of a hard
form of copper. This was a
tin ore, and the hard copper
was actually a copper-tin
alloy. The alloy was called
bronze (possibly from a Per-
sian word for “copper”).

Bronze was hard
enough to compete with
rock. It could hold an edge
better and could, of course
be beaten back into shape if
necessary, though that was
not often required

Increasingly bronze

came to be used for tools
and for weapons and
armor, too. By 3000 B.c

the Middle East was in the
Bronze Age, and this spread
outward slowly in all direc-
tions as the methods of

copper-smelting and

 

bronze formation diffused
The great cultural
product of the Bronze Age
was Homer's Iliad, the tale
of the Trojan War (fought
about 1200 B.c.), in which
both Greek and Trojan

heroes fought in bronze

 

armor, carried bronze
shields, and struck out with
bronze swords and bronze-
tipped spears
 

Science in the Ancient World
(3500 B.C.—A.D. 475)

 

While other Middle Eastern
cultures were major powers
in the ancient world, Egypt
was the first nation. Begin-
ning in 3100 B.C., city-
states along 500 miles of
the River Nile shared a
common language and cul-
ture. Around the same
time, the first European civ-
ilization developed on the
island of Crete. By 2500
B.C., Chinese civilization
arose along the Yellow
River, and agriculture
began to develop in Central
America. The science and
technology of these early
times was initially practi-
cal—metallurgy for tools
and weapons; astronomy
for telling time and know-
ing when to plant and har-
vest; mathematics and
geometry for measurement,
navigation, and architec-
ture. A quantum leap in
communications was made
around 1500 B.c., when
Phoenician traders created
the alphabet—symbols
used not for ideas but for
the sounds that make up
words. This revolutionary
method made writing and
reading much easier. Be-
fore the ascendancy of the
Greeks, the Phoenicians

were the supreme seafar-
ers of the Mediterranean—
and beyond. By 1100 B.c.,
they were using star con-
stellations to guide their
oar-powered ships into ter-
ritories in the western
Mediterranean and be-
yond. The greatest scien-
tific contribution of the
Greeks, whose culture
began to flourish around
800 B.c., was their ap-
proach. In their search for
general principles that
would describe how the
world worked, they
evolved theories based on
what they could prove. Un-
like the great cultures that
had preceded them, the
Greeks separated science
from religion and supersti-
tion. Their astronomical in-
vestigations yielded results
that far surpassed earlier
knowledge, and they were
the first to consider mathe-
matics apart from the prac-
ticalities of calculation

and measurement, devel-
oping over a period of
eight hundred years meth-
ods of reasoning in geome-
try and algebra that form
the basis for modern math-
ematics. Practical appli-
cations were not, of

course, ignored. For
example, among the nu-
merous discoveries and in-
novations of Archimedes
were an explanation of the
principle of buoyancy and
the theory of how levers
work. Besides laying out
the system of rational
thought we call logic, Aris-
totle is recognized as the
father of the life sciences.
He examined and classi-
fied more than five hun-
dred species of animals,
and his student Theophras-
tus did the same for a simi-
lar number of plant
species. The Greek physi-
cian Hippocrates is called
the father of medicine be-
cause, in the fifth century
B.C., he rejected the idea
that illness was a result of
supernatural intervention.
Greek physicians were the
first to dissect the human
body, beginning about 500
B.c. By 100 B.c., Greece
had declined and Rome
was supreme in the Medi-
terranean world. The
Romans were not innova-
tors, but they did find
practical uses for Greek
knowledge—especially in
engineering and construe-
tion—and as the Roman

 
 

Empire spread so did the
extent of learning. When
the empire collapsed to-

3500 B.C.

ward the end of the fifth
century A.p., scientific in-
quiry came to an end in

Europe. The Dark Ages
had begun.

 

Wheeled Carts

Where objects are too
heavy to be carried by
hand, transportation over
land becomes a problem.
Even where land is fairly
smooth, there is consider-
able friction, whether the
ground is sandy, pebbly, or
grassy.

Heavy objects had to
be dragged on sledges by
sheer force at first, and
even when animals
stronger than humans were
used (oxen, for instance), it
was slow going.

It could be made easier
if crude rollers in the form
of woaden logs were placed
under sledges. The rollers
turned rather than
dragged, and that cut down
on friction considerably. It
meant less work, but might
actually take more time, as
rollers had to be picked up
from the back and put
down again in front. What
is needed is an axle and
wheels.

We don't know how
someone came to think of
attaching two rollers to the
sledge back and front in
such a way that they rolled

inside the straps that held
them and remained with
the sledge at all times. At
the end of each roller, solid
wooden wheels were then
placed to lift the sledge off
the ground, and the wheels
turned freely.

A wheeled cart moves
more quickly and with far
less effort than a sledge,
even a sledge on rollers, so
that such carts marked a
revolution in land transpor-
tation. They made trade
easier, for one thing.

Such carts had showed
up in Sumeria by 3500 B.c.

River Boats

1t is certainly easier to
carry heavy loads over
water than over land.
Water offers much less fric-
tion than land does, and
there are no permanent un-
evennesses in it: no rocks,
no ridges, no uphill
stretches.

In this connection, the
Nile was ideal. Not only
was it a source of water for
rainless Egypt—not only
did its annual flood periodi-
cally fertilize the soil—but
its current was gentle and

there were no storms. The
Nile did not damage and
overturn boats as the un-
ruly Tigris in Sumeria did.
(The very name of that
river is the Greek word for
“tiger."")

What's more, the Nile
flows almost due north,
while the wind is almost
always from the north.
Therefore a boat can move
smoothly down river and,
when the time comes to re-
turn, a sail can be hoisted
to catch the wind and
the ship will be blown
upstream.

Egypt is not a forest na-
tion, but it had luxuriani
stands of reeds (called papy-
rus) along the river in those
days, and the reeds could
be used in bundles to build
boats. The boats were built
to form hollows, so that
they would displace more
water and carry more
weight without sinking.
These reed boats were not
particularly sturdy, but the
gentle Nile did not require
sturdy boats. (When Moses
was set afloat in the Nile
River, he was placed in a
little boat—or ark—of
bulrushes; that is, papyrus.)
Egypt thus had a most

convenient form of commu-

nication that perhaps ac-
counted for its slowness to
adopt the Sumerian
wheeled cart. Egypt had
scarcely any need for land
transportation.

By 0 B.c. Egyptian

 

boats had begun to ply the
Nile, and by 3000 B.c. they
were venturing out of the
Nile into the Mediterra-
1ean, hugging the shore,

 

and making their way past
Sinai and Canaan to Leba-
non. There they obtained
the tree-trunks they lacked
in Egypt and brought them
back for construction pur-
poses.

Writing

Because Sumeria was the
most advanced and com-
plex civilization in the
world, life was more com-

 

 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 

plex too. People had to keep
track of the grain they pro-
duced, how much they
traded, what they bought
and sold, and what they
contributed to the common
fund (in what we call taxes).

It became more and
more difficult to keep it all
in mind. We can say this
without casting aspersions
on the extraordinary pow-
ers of a trained memory. It
was necessary to keep
score.

Almost anyone can
think of making some sort
of mark in the ground to
stand for a basket full of
fruit and then eventually
counting the marks in
order to know how many
baskets have been deliv-
ered. It’s just that if society
is simple, there is no need
to take the trouble to do
this.

However, as the mem-
ory becomes strained, such
marks are made. In order
to simplify matters, differ-
ent marks would be made
for one, five, and ten, per-
haps so that there would
not be too many unit-marks
to count. This would lead
on to a mark that meant
fruit and another that
meant grain and still an-
other that meant man and
so on. Eventually there
would be marks, perhaps
crude pictures at first, for
every different object. If dif-
ferent people agree on the
marks and learn how to

  
make them and how to
interpret them, you have
writing.

The Sumerians seem to
have been the first to work
out a writing system, using
a stylus that produced
wedge-shaped marks in soft
clay. This was later called
cuneiform, from Greek
words meaning "‘wedge-
shaped.” As time went on,
the symbols became more
styvlized and somewhat sim-
pler and lost their function
as pictorial representa-
tions. Nevertheless, each
symbol stood for a word,
more or less, so that anyone
who wanted to read and
write had to memorize hun-
dreds and even thousands
of different symbols.

This meant that the lit-
erates (those who could
read and write) were al-
ways a small minority of
the population, but that
was all that was needed
in those days to run the
society.

Egypt picked up the
notion of writing and
invented a totally different
set of signs, as complicated
in its way as the cuneiform.

3100 B.C.

The Egyptian writing is
called hieroglyphic (from
Greek words meaning
"priestly writing," because
the Greeks came into con-
tact with it mostly in Egyp-
tian temples), It was
brushed onto thin flexible
sheets of papyrus pith.

Writing makes an enor-
mous difference. It is a kind
of frozen speech. Thoughts
and records remain much
more permanent than the
spoken word and, if care-
fully copied now and then,
persist indefinitely and re-
main more precise than the
memory of the spoken word
usually is.

This means that each
generation can learn, more
precisely and quickly, the
accumulated experience
and wisdom of the previous
generation, and advances
quicken as a result.

Furthermore, the re-
cords kept in writing give
us a reasonably exact ver-
sion of events that took
place in the past, complete
with names, places, and de-
tails. In order to under-
stand what went on in a
society without writing, we

must try to interpret mat-
ters from the artilacts they
left behind—from their pot-
tery, their art, and even
their garbage.

A society that possesses
writing is therefore historic.
One that does not is prefis-
torie. In other words, his-
tory began with Sumeria
about 3500 B.c.

Ploughs

In the early days of agricul-
ture, seed used to be secat-
tered over the ground,
where it grew in anarchic
fashion. Eventually it was
discovered that if the grain
was planted in separated
rows, it was then easier to
water, to weed, and to har-
vest.

In its simplest form,
the plough was a forked
stick that was dragged
through the soil making a
furrow in which the seeds
were planted. This greatly
hastened the rate of sow-
ing. A plough was first used
in Sumeria about 3500 B.C.

 

Nations

As city-states enlarged their
boundaries and grew more
populous, their territories

were bound Lo run into
each other and their inter-
dependence to grow.

Just as il was necessary
to organize matters within

a city-state when irrigation
came into use, it became
necessary to organize mat-
ters still further throughout
all the city-states of a par-
 

ticular river. It did no good
for one city-state to keep its
irrigation ditches and
levees in tip-top shape if
another one upstream
allowed its own to go to
pieces and produce an un-
timely flood, or cut the flow
of water downstream.
There was therefore
pressure for union, and this
was carried out first in
Egypt. The ease of commu-
nication along the Nile

3000 B.C.

tended to even out differ-
ences, and all the city-
states for 500 miles along
the river had the same cul-
ture and the same lan-
guage.

About 3100 B.C., the
city-states of the Nile delta
(lower Egypt) were united
with those south of the
delta (upper Egypt) under
the rule of Menes, the first
king of the First Dynasty.
(An Egyptian priest,

Manetho, about 300 B.c.,
wrote a history of Egypt
and divided its rulers into
dynasties, each one repre-
senting a family whose
members ruled over Egypt
for a period of time.)

Since the Egyptian
city-states shared a com-
mon language and culture,
Egypt can be viewed as
what we would today call a
nation. It was the first na-
tion the world had seen.

 

Candles

Oil lamps had been used
for thousands of years and
would continue to be used
for thousands more, but the
oil could be spilled, which
could spread fire danger-

2800 B.C.

Calendars

Use of the day (or the alter-
nation of day and night)
and parts of the day as de-
termined by a sundial is in-

 

 

ously. If some solid fat was
melted and then allowed to
solidify again about a wick,
the solid would be illumi-
nant and container at once.
Such a candle could be car-
ried about without danger
of spilling.

sufficient as a means for

keeping track of time. Cer-
tain phenomena, such as
the changing of the seasons,
have periods that are sev-
eral hundred days long. It

    

The earliest candles are
shown in Egyptian paint-
ings dating back to about
3000 B.c. and they have
been in use ever since,
though at the present time
they are used more for deco-
ration than illumination.

   

is tedious to count those
days, and the chances of
mistakes are great.

There is a cycle of inter-
mediate length, however,
that of the phases of the
Moon. It takes 29 or 30
days for the Moon to go
through its cycle of phases,
and it takes 12 or 13 of
these cycles (months, from
the word Moon) to make up
the cycle of the seasons.

We don’t know when
people first began to attach
importance to the months.
There are indications that
even prehistoric people
counted them, but it was
the people of the Tigris-
Euphrates region who first
systematized the matter.
They worked out a cycle of
19 years, in which certain
years had 12 lunar months
and others had 13 lunar
months. Such a cycle kept
the years even with the sea-
sons. This lunar calendar
was adopted by the Greeks
and the Jews and is still
used as the Jewish liturgi-
cal calendar.

The Egyptians, how-
ever, did not make use of
the Moon primarily. To

2650 B.C.

them, the important [ea-
ture of the year was the pe-
riodic flooding of the Nile.
The priests in charge of irri-
gation carefully studied the
height of the river from day
to day and eventually dis-
covered that, on the aver-
age, the flood came every
365 days. That was also the
time it took the Sun to
make an apparent circuit of
the sky relative to the stars.
(In modern times, we view
this as the time it takes the
Earth to go around the
Sun.) This is the solar year,
and a calendar based on it
is a solar calendar.

The Egyptians were
aware that there were 12
new Moons to the year, so
they had 12 months, but
they made each month 30
days long, paying no atten-
tion to the actual phase of
the Moon. That made 360
days, to which they added 5
more days at the end.

This calendar was

much simpler and handier
than any other calendar in-
vented in ancient times.
Historians are uncertain of
the date when it was first
adopted, but priests may
have been using it for their
private computations (it ob-
viously made them more
powerful if they alone knew
when the Nile would flood)
as early as 2800 B.c.

Nothing better than
the Egyptian calendar was
devised for nearly three
thousand years, and even
then what was produced
was a mere modification of
it—and not all the changes
were for the better. Our
present calendar is still
based on the Egyptian cal-
endar, with changes that
are, in some cases, also not
for the better. This makes
our calendar, in essence,
nearly five thousand years
old.

 

Stone
Monuments

Thanks to the Nile, the
Egyptians were able to
grow a surplus of food so
that many could devote
themselves, for at least part

of the year, to other tasks.
That meant that the Egyp-
tian rulers could put the
Egyptian people to work on
public projects designed to
show the greatness of their
rulers and, through them,
of the nation and the peo-
ple. The projects would

also serve as memorials to
that greatness to future gen-
erations.

Thus the Egyptian rul-
ers built elaborate houses
(or palaces, as we now call
them). Indeed, the ruler
was referred to as pharaoh,
which is the Greek version
of an Egyptian word mean-
ing “big house.” (This is
similar to our present habit
of saying “the White
House” when we mean the
president.)

It was customary for
the important citizens of
the nation to build them-
selves elaborate burial
tombs, since Egyptian reli-
gion dealt in detail with life
after death, and it was felt
that, to insure immortality,
the body had to be pre-
served. The tombs were
oblong objects called
mastabas. (Nowadays, to
insure the immortality of
our presidents, we build co-
lossal presidential librar-
ies.)

In about 2686 B.c.,
when Djoser, the second
king of the Third Dynasty
came to power, he decided
to build a particularly elab-
orate tomb as a memorial
to his greatness. He had a
counselor named Imhotep
who supervised the build-
ing of six mastabas of
stone, one on top of the
other, each smaller than
the one below. The result
was basically pyramidal in
shape, but it was set back

periodically as modern sky-
scrapers sometimes are. Be-
cause these setbacks were
like steps a giant would use
in climbing to the top, the
structure is called the Step
Pyramid. The base is an ob-
long about 400 feet by 350
feet, and the top is almost
200 feet high.

The Step Pyramid was
the first large stone struc-
ture ever built and is the
oldest structure built by hu-
mans that remains substan-
tially intact today.

The Step Pyramid set a
fashion, and for a couple of
centuries afterward the
pharaohs kept the people
busy in their spare time
building more and more
elaborate pyramids. Larger
and larger stones were
used, and the climax came
when the Pharaoh Khufu
(Cheops to the Greeks) su-
pervised construction of the
Great Pyramid, the largest
of all, in about 2530 B.c.

When that pyramid
was finished, its square
base was 755 feet on each
side, so that it covered an
area of 13 acres. The four
sides sloped upward evenly
(for the notion of steps had

been abandoned) to a point
481 feet high. It was solidly
composed of slabs of rock—
2,300,000 of them, it is esti-
mated, with an average
weight of 2'4 tons apiece.
Each had to be brought
some 600 miles, by water,
of course, from quarries far
up the Nile.

In among these rocky
slabs were passages leading
to a chamber near the cen-
ter of the huge pile, which
was to contain the king'’s
coffin, his mummy, and
his treasures after his
death.

The fad for such large,
vainglorious structures did
not persist for long. They
took too much time and too
much work even for Egypt.
The urge to build big ob-
jects, some useful, some
symbolic, some vainglori-
ous, has never left human-
ity, however. Some of the
medieval cathedrals finally
surpassed the pyramids in
height (after 3,500 years or
so) and today, of course, we
have our skyscrapers, our
huge bridges and dams,
and so on.

Literature

Telling stories is probably
as old as speech, and gifted
storytellers were probably
as much in demand fifty
thousand years ago as they
are today. Eventually, quite
elaborate stories were
memorized and told, or
chanted, to audiences
Homer’s [liad and Odyssey
were probably recited
many times before being re-
duced to permanent form.

Once writing was in-
vented, it could only be a
matter of time before it was
used to record the more fa-
mous oral tales and sagas.
As long as a tale is avail-
able only in oral form, a
person can only hear it
when a bard is available
and is willing to recite it. It
represents a rare theatrical
performance. Once the
same tale is in written
form, it can be read at will
and at any time. A written
story is a permanently
available bard.

The Sumerians, who in-
vented writing, were very

  

likely the first to put tales
into writing. One of thesc
tales was discovered in the
remains of the library of
Ashurbanipal, an Assyrian
king who ruled from 668 to
626 B.C

 

nearly two thou

sand years after the Sumeri-

ans had established written
literature

The discovery was
made in 1872 by an Ex
archaeologist, George
Smith (1840-1876). He

lish

 

found twelve clay tablets in-

scribed with cuneiform
writing, telling the tale of a
Sumerian king named Gil-
gamesh and his search for
immortality.

The story may have
first appeared in writlen
form as early as 2500 B.c. It
contains, as a subplot, the
tale of a great flood that
had ravaged the Tigris
phrates valley some centu-
ries earlier. This story was
borrowed by the biblical
writers, who described it as
Noah's Flood and imagined
it to have been worldwide

is the oldest written tale

that has survived to

day almost intact and may

be considered to represent
the founding of written lit
erature.

Glass

Glass is made out of sand
rather than out of clay as
pottery is. Glass is not
really a solid at all but a
liquid that is so stiff it does

not flow perceptibly and

 

seems to be solid. It is much

   

more fragile and easily bro
ken than pottery is, and it
would not be considered a
reasonable competitor for a
moment except for its
beauty. Glass has a certain

transparency, and the pres

  

ence of impurities (some-

 

times deliberately added)
can give it deep and lovely

Empires

Conflict of some sort is as
old as life. With human be-
ings, conflict reached new
pitches of danger, thanks to
intelligence. Human beings
can remember past wrongs,
brood upon them, and plot
revenge. They can also,
after victory, realize that
the defeated parties may
plot revenge, and therefore
take further action to wipe
them out completely.
What's more, the advance
of technology put weapons
in human hands that made
conflict ever bloodier.
Sumeria was not as for-
tunately placed as Egypt
was. The Tigris and Eu-
phrates did not offer quite
the same gentle watery
highway that the Nile did.
Communications were not
as effective and there
seemed less community of
interests among the people
of the region. The Sumer-
ian city-states, with their
wheeled carts and bronze
weapons, fought each other
more assiduously than the
Egyptian city-states did.
What's more, whereas
Egypt was protected on
both sides of the Nile by de-

sert, Sumeria was more
open to invasion. The result
was that non-Sumerian
people settled on the upper
reaches of the Tigris and
Euphrates.

Just to the north of
Sumeria, where the Eu-
phrates and Tigris come
closest together, cities were
founded by Akkadians, who
spoke a non-Sumerian lan-
guage. The Akkadian lan-
guage was of a type that
came to be called Semitic.
(The most important Se-
mitic language extant
today is Arabic.) The Sum-
erian language was not Se-
mitic and, in fact, is not
related to any other lan-
guage we know of. There
was even less community of
interest between the Sum-
erian city-states and their
Akkadian neighbors than
between the Sumerian city-
states themselves.

Thus it came about
that, even seven centuries
after Egypt had formed a
nation, the city-states of the
Tigris and Euphrates were
unable to unite in peace. It
was clear that the region
would prosper best under
unified rule, but there was
no agreement as to which

city and which ruler should
take over the leadership,
and the matter had to be
settled by force.

About 2350 B.c., a man
named Sargon (ca. 2334—
2279 B.c.) took over the rule
of Agade, one of the Akkad-
ian cities. He was success-
ful in war and established
his rule over all of both
Akkad and Sumeria. He
also sent his armies north-
ward and eastward and es-
tablished his control over
the upper reaches of the
Tigris-Euphrates valley, a
region that eventually
came to be known as As-
syria, and over the territory
to the east of the Tigris,
which was known as Elam.

While the Egyptian uni-
fication involved city-states
of similar language and cul-
ture, Sargon ruled over peo-
ples with different
languages and cultures, his
Akkadians being dominant
over the others.

If one cultural group
dominates others politi-
cally and militarily, the re-
sult is commonly referred
to as an empire. Sargon es-
tablished the first empire
we know of. It was not, of
course, the last.

Horses

Until now, the animals that
had been used for pulling
carts and ploughs were
oxen and donkeys. The ox
was strong, but it was lum-
bering, stupid, and slow.
The donkey was more intel-
ligent, but it was smaller
and weaker than the ox.
Neither could pull the
heavy, solid-wheeled carts
rapidly.

Ammal transport could
not be used in warfare with
any great success, there-
fore. Armies consisted of
masses of foot soldiers, who
slogged into each other,
wielding spears and swords
and cowering behind their
shields, until one side or
the other broke and ran.
The carts could serve only
as a ceremonial means of
keeping the ruler and other
military leaders from walk-
ing, or to carry arms and
supplies.

But then, about 2000
B.C., a flect beast was tamed

—the wild horse—and not
by any of the civilizations
but by nomadic dwellers in
the steppes of what we now
call Iran, The horse was
larger and stronger than
the donkey, and faster and
more intelligent than the
ox. At first, though, it
seemed useless for trans-
port, for it was difficult to
harness. A harness that was
suitable for an ox placed
pressure on the horse’s
windpipe and cut its speed.
Then, some time before
1800 B.c., someone devised
a method of using the horse
for specialized light trac-
tion. A cart was made as
light as possible, becoming
scarcely more than a small
platform between two large
wheels, a platform just
large enough to hold a
human being. Even the
wheels were lightened,
without loss of strength, by
being made spoked rather
than solid, and they were
so fixed to the axle that
they could turn individu-

ally. The result was a char-
iot (a word not too different
from cart).

A horse, or horses, pull-
ing so light a load could
run fleetly, much faster
than a foot soldier could.
With only two wheels, the
chariot was almost as ma-
neuverable as the horse it-
self and could skid into a
new direction with little
trouble.

1t did not take long for
the nomads to discover that
a body of charioteers, driv-
ing in fiercely, could not be
stopped by the foot soldiers
of the day, Indeed, foot sol-
diers broke and fled in hor-
ror at the first sight of the
animals thundering toward
them.

This is the first clear
case we have of a new war
weapon catching those
without it by surprise and
bestowing a kind of univer-
sal victory on those who
had it. The raiding nomads
ripped into the Tigris-
Euphrates valley, which
 

came under “barbarian
rule” for a period of time.
The nomads established the
kingdom of Mitanni in

what is now Syria and
northern Iraq, and the
Hittite kingdom in what is
now eastern Turkey. In

1800 B.C.

Mathematics
and Astronomy

The concept of mathemat-
ics is as old as human be-
ings. Even some animals
have a primitive number
sense.

It is certainly difficult
to believe that the pyra-
mids, for instance, could
have been built without
substantial ability in geom-
etry.

The Sumerians, and
the Babylonians who suc-
ceeded them, were the first
to make significant ad-
vances in mathematics and
in astronomy. By 1800 B.c.,
they had developed a num-
ber system based on 60 that
we still follow in some

 

1700 B.c., the horsemen
drove down into Canaan
and then even into Egypt,
which fell to alien invaders
for the first time, and also
into India.

Such invasions spread
devastation in the settled

ways, since we still have 60
seconds to the minute and
60 minutes to the hour.
Why 60? Because it can be
evenly divided by 2, 3,4, 5,
6,10, 12, 15, and 30, thus
eliminating the frequent
need of fractions—with
which the ancients had
trouble.

In addition, there are
360 degrees (6 x 60) in the
circle. Again, it is a number
easily divided. In addition,
the Sun takes 365 days to
move completely around
the sky, so that it travels,
relative to the stars, just
about 1 degree per day.
That too may have influ-
enced the choice of 360.

The sky-watchers of the
Tigris-Euphrates valley
eventually discovered that,

    

areas, but they did tend to
stir things up. They helped
change ways of life that

had perhaps become some-
what decadent, and encour-
aged the flow of new ideas
from one settled place to an-
other.

   

in addition to the Sun and
Moon, five bright stars
changed position against
the remaining “fixed” stars.
These moving stars, which
we call planets (from a
Greek word for “wander-
ing"") were given the names
of gods and goddesses, and
we still do that today. We
call the five bright stars
Mercury, Venus, Mars, Jupi-
ter, and Saturn. The pres-
ence of seven such planets
(if we include the Sun and
the Moon) gave rise to the
seven-day week, with one of
the planets in charge of
each day. The week as a
unit of time was thus insti-
tuted by the Babylonians
and was adopted first by
the Jews, then by the Chris-
tians, and through them, by
 

virtually all the modern
world.

The seven planets had
paths around the sky, paths
that passed through certain
conglomerations of stars
that were termed, in total,
the zodiac by the later
Greeks. This was divided
into twelve constellations,
so that the Sun remained in
each constellation for about
a month. Eventually the
Sumerians and Babylo-
nians worked out the path-
ways in some detail and
could predict, in at least a
rough manner, where the
planets would be at future
times. That represented the
beginning of mathematical
astronomy.

Since the Sun affected
the Earth profoundly, mak-
ing the difference between
the day and night, and the
Moon's phases marked the
length of the month, it
seemed natural to suppose
that the other planets also
had significance to human
beings. Imaginative sugges-
tions were made about the
influence of each, as it var-
ied in position with respect
to the stars and other plan-
ets, and an intricate system
of foretelling the future
from planetary positions

was evolved. This is astrol-
ogy.

Astrology is utter non-
sense, but people strongly
want the security of know-
ing the future, so that even
today astrology is accepted
by many people who are un-
educated, unsophisticated,
or simply silly.

Fermentation

Fruit juices that are left
standing will sometimes
ferment; that is, undergo
changes that alter the taste.
The same is true of moist-
ened grain. Human beings,
driven by thirst or hunger,
might consume such fer-
mented materials and then
find that they liked the
taste and the aftereffects.
They were, of course, con-
suming alcohol, formed
from sugars and starches
by yeast, and they would
grow elated as a result, be-
cause somewhat intoxi-
cated. (This is not an
exclusively human trait.
Birds and animals will
sometimes greedily feed on
fermented fruits and be-
come obviously intoxicated
too.)

This may have hap-
pened in prehistoric times,

B

but by 1800 B.c. the use of
fermented materials was so
common that laws had to
be passed directing what
was to be done in the case
of misdeeds committed
under the influence of too
much beer.

From the¢ beginning of
agriculture, grain was con-
verted into lour, which
was moistencd and made
into flat, hard, but nourish-
ing bread. Every once ina
while, though, the moist-
ened dough fermented and
released gases (carbon diox-
ide) that caused the bread
to rise and grow spongy.
The result was leavened
bread (from a Latin word
meaning “to rise’), which
was just as nutritious as
flat bread but softer and
much more pleasant to eat.

The Egyptians discov-
ered this not long after
1800 B.c. and eventually
learned that the process
could be controlled. If some
of the fermenting bread
was saved before it was
baked and added to dough
that had not yet begun to
ferment, the fresh dough
would ferment in its turn.
One would not have to de-
pend on chance.
  

1775 B.C.

Law

Human beings must always
have had customs that they
followed assiduously, even
when enforcement was not
an issue,

In a simple society, cus-
tom is, in fact, enough. Ev-
eryone knows what
behavior is expected, and
conforms almost automati-
cally. If not, there is social
ostracism, and this is suffi-
ciently undesirable to en-
force the rule of custom.

As a society grows
more complex, however,
there are more varieties of
behavior that must be con-
trolled and regulated, more
perplexing conditions,
more complicated ques-
tions, more puzzling inter-
actions. It becomes difficult
to remember all the rules,
and the suspicion is sure to
arise that powerful people
make up or alter rules to
suit themselves. The de-
mand, then, is for the rules
of society to be put in writ-
ing, so that all can see for

  

themselves what they are,
and so that they cannot be
unfairly or arbitrarily
twisted or modified.

We don't know when
the first laws were written
down, but the first rela-
tively complete law code
that we still have was estab-
lished by Hammurabi, king
of Babylon (reigned 1792—
1750 B.c.), who founded a
rather short-lived Babylo-
nian Empire in the Tigris-
Euphrates valley, one that
succeeded the Akkadian
Empire. (After this time, the
people of the valley were re-
ferred to as Babylonians for
nearly two millennia.)

Perhaps about 1775
B.C., Hammurabi had his
law code inscribed on an
8-foot-high stone pillar of
hard diorite. It was clearly
intended to be permanent,
and it was, for we still have
it

The stele is topped by a
relief that shows Hammu-
rabi standing before the
Sun-god, Shamash. (It was
usual in ancient times to

 

suppose that a law code
was received by a king
from a god. That tended to
lend the law authority.
Thus, Moses received the
Jewish law code from God
on Mount Sinai, according
to the Bible.)

Down along the face of
the stele are twenty-one col-
umns of finely written cune-
iform, outlining nearly
three hundred laws that
were to govern people’s ac-
tions and guide the king
and his officials in dispens-
ing justice.

The stele originally
stood in the town of Sippar,
some 30 miles upstream
from Babylon, but an invad-
ing Elamite force plun-
dered the city and carried
away the stele as spoil. It re-
mained in Elam’s capital,
Susa, thereafter and was
still there, in Susa’s ruins,
in 1901, when a French ar-
chaeologist, Jacques Jean
Marie de Morgan (1857—
1924), found it and brought
it back to Europe.

Medicine

People are sure to get sick
at times, or have accidents
and be hurt. The problem
of getting well, or being
made well, naturally con-
cerns everyone.

To aid the coming of
wellness, people might at-
tempt to conciliate various

gods by proper incanta-

 

tions or rituals, make use of
various forms of ritualized
behavior, or use parts of
plants or animals thoug
to have curative value
The first written compi-
lation of such cures that we
know of is an ptian pa

Alphabet

By 1500 B.c., Egyptian hi-
eroglyphic writing and Bab-
ylonian cuneiform writing
(inherited from the Sumeri-
ans), together with Chinese
writing in the Far East,
were the most important
written languages in the
world. All remained terri-
bly complicated, and there
is no reason they should

not have remained compli-
cated until the present
time. The Chinese language

words should be built up
out of them.

Monotheism

It is customary for people
to believe in a multitude of
separate supernatural in-
fluences, Every object—the
Sun, the Moon, trees, ani-
mals, even abstractions
such as tribes and nations
—must have its supernatu-
ral accompaniment, cause,
or protector.

The first person we
know of to suppose that
there was only one divine
influence that controlled ev-

 

 

The first two symbols
of this collection were aleph
(the usual symbol for an ox)
and beth (the usual symbol
for a house). To the Greeks,
who eventually adopted the
system, these became alpha
and beta, and we still call
the system of symbols the
alphabet.

The Phoenician alpha-
bet, which first came into
use about 1500 B.c., revolu-
tionized writing, making it
far easier to write and to
read, so that the chances of

erything was an Egyptian
pharach named Amenhotep
IV, who reigned over Egypt
from 1379 to 1362 B.c. He
accepted the Sun-god as
the one and only god, and
this makes some sense,
since the Sun is an overrid-
ing influence on Earth and
on humanity. The Sun-god
was, to him, Aton, and he
called himself Akhenaton,
meaning “Aton is satis-
fied.” His seventeen-year
reign was a failure, how-
ever, because his views

literacy were increased.
This is one invention that
seems to have oceurred
only once in human his-
tory. The alphabet was not
invented independently by
any other society. All alpha-
bets in use today (including
the one in which this beok
is written and printed) are
descended from that first
Phoenician one.

   

were not accepted by the
priesthood or by the Egyp-
tian people, who clung to
their old ways.

It is possible, however,
that the Akhenatonic tradi-
tion lingered among a few
and influenced Moses, the
legendary leader who
brought the Israelite slaves
out of Egypt, according to
the Bible, about a century
and a half after Akhena-
ton's time. (The later Jews
attributed monotheism to
the legendary Abraham,

  
 

about four or five centuries
before Akhenaton, but there
is no record of Abraham
outside the Bible.)

Monotheism was a
clear advance over polythe

ism, since it reduced the

The human urge to beautify
is irresistable, and since we

can see colors, we usua
find them, singly and in
combination, to be more at-
tractive than black and
white. The Old Stone Age
artists used colored earths
to make their paintings

As early as 3000 B.C.,
dyes were used to color oth-
erwise white or yellowish
cloth, both in Egypt and in
China. Indigo, a blue color
extracted from a plant, was
used and madder, a red

 

color extracted from the
root of another plant. By

1400 B.C., cloth could be

dyed in virtually all colors.
The chief trouble with

most early dyes was that

they tended to bleach in the

sun and to wash out in
water, so that dyed fabrics
quickly
blurred.

Sea Navigation

Boats had been in existence
for over two thousand
years, but they had been
confined to rivers. When
they did venture out to sea,
they generally hugged the
coast. Even the Cretans, the
boldest seagoers up to this
time, had confined them-
selves to the eastern Medi-
terranean and felt safest in
the Aegean Sea, where nu-
merous islands made possi-
ble short sails from land to
land.

Greek legends treated
distant portions of the sea
as places of myth and mys-
tery. The tale of Jason and
the Argonauts reflects early
ventures into the large and
island-free Black Sea.
Homer's Odyssey describes
the adventures of Odysseus
in the even larger western
Mediterranean.

The first to cast out
boldly into the open sea
were the Phoenicians. They
noted that the seven stars
that made up the familiar
grouping of the Big Dipper
were always located to the
north and were visible all
night long at every season
of the year (barring the
presence of clouds). This
must surely have been
known for a long time, but
the Phoenicians seem to
have been the first who
were willing to risk their
ships and lives on the fact.
By observing the Big Dip-
per, they knew always
which direction was north,
and from that they knew all
other directions. This obvi-
ated the fear of being lost
once out of sight of land
and “landmarks."” There
were always the “sky-
marks,” so to speak.

In addition, the Phoeni-

cians refused to depend on
sails and wind alone. The
wind was erratic, after all,
so the Phoenicians used
oars, which the Egyptians
had been using on the Nile
for twenty centuries. Oared
ships (galleys) now ruled
the Mediterranean for
twenty-six centuries.

Using oars, and keep-
ing the Big Dipper on the
right, the Phoenician ship
captains could sail boldly
westward, knowing they
could return by remember-
ing to keep the Big Dipper
on the left. Beginning about
1100 B.c. then, the Phoeni-
cians explored the coasts of
northern Africa west of
Egypt and southern Europe
west of Greece, trading and
in some cases settling.

Iron

Iron is the second most
common metal in the
Earth's crust (only alumi-
num is more common), but
it always occurs in combi-
nation with other sub-
stances. It is not found in
free metallic form except in
some meteorites, which are
not of Earth but fall from
the sky.

Such meteorites were
occasionally found by the
ancients and used even in
the earliest days of civiliza-
tion. Compared to gold, sil-
ver, and copper, iron is an
ugly metal, but the mete-
oric iron that was found re-
vealed itself to be harder
and tougher even than
bronze. Since it held its
edge far better than bronze
did, it was much in de-
mand for edged portions of
tools.

The result is that no
iron meteorite from the

past is ever found where
the earliest civilizations
lourished. The ancients
scavenged them all.

Yet ores did not yield
iron. Gold, silver, copper,
lead, tin, and eventually
mercury were obtained
with ease by use of wood
fires, but such fires never
yielded iron. Iron held on to
other substances more
tightly than the other met-
als did, and a higher tem-
perature was needed.

Eventually, though
charcoal was obtained by
burning wood with an in-
sufficient supply of air so
that more-or-less pure car
bon was left behind when
other substances burned
away. Charcoal burns
flamelessly but reaches
higher temperatures than
wood does.

About 1500 B.c. the Hit
tites of Asia Minor found
they could obtain iron [rom
certain ores by heating

 

those ores with burning
charcoal. Iron was at first a
disappointment. In pure

form, it is tough but n

  

 

hard as the best bronze
(Meteoric iron is nol pure
iron but is a 9-to-1 mixture
of iron and nickel, some-
thing the ancients
duplicate since they knew
nothing of nickel.)

Aqueducts

As cities grew, supplying
what was needed to so
many people so densely
packed together became a
problem. Air itself, the
most immediate and press-
ing necessity, was available
everywhere more or less
(though the use of fires in
every house could fill that

air with unpleasant smoke).

Water was more of a

problem. Cities are usually
built where there is a water
supply, but as they grow,
the water supply may be-
come insufficient. Wells
within the city limits or
just outside may not supply
enough. [t may then be-
come necessary to letch
water from some distance,
either through canals or
tunnels or along artificial
structures of masonry.
These last are called ag-

weducts (from Latin words
meaning "a drawing off of
water”) and by 700 B.c.,
Sennacherib, who was king
of Assyria from 704 to 681
B.C., had an aqueduct con-
structed that would bring
water into his capital,
Nineveh. At about the same
time, Hezekiah, king of
Judah from about 715 1o
about 686 B.c., built an ag-
ueduct to supply Jerusalem
with water.
 

Zoos

From the beginning of
genus Homo, hominids and
modern human beings had
been hunting animals for
food. No thought was given
to conserving the animals.
Either people took it for
granted that every species
of animal would always
exist, or they gave it no
thought at all. The Assyrian
monarchs were great hunt-
ers themselves (for sport,
rather than for food), and
Assyrian art is full of repre-
sentations of the kings slay-
ing lions and other
animals.

evertheless, there was
also sometimes the impulse

640 B.C.

Libraries

Books, whether clay bricks
covered with cuneiform or
papyrus covered with hiero-
glyphics and rolled up (the
word volume is from the
Latin word for “to roll up")
were hard to come by in an-
cient times. To get an addi-
tional copy of a book, it had
to be copied over, stroke by

 

 

to conserve. If an animal
was rare, there might be a
certain prestige in keeping
it for one's pleasure, as one
might keep a rare work of
art. An early example of
this could be found on the
palace grounds of the Assyr-
ian king Sennacherib (see
above), where there was a
zoo and also a botanical
garden.

Sundials

The original sundial was a
stick pounded into the
ground so that its shadow
might be studied (see 4000
B.c.). Such a stick was
called a gnomon (a Greek
word meaning “indicator”)

stroke, by a meticulous and
thoroughly literate scribe.
Such copying took a long
time and was hard work, so
that books were both rare
and expensive.

Only a few people
could own books, and a li-
brary (from a Latin word
for “book"’) consisting of
several books must have
been the mark of a rich

since it gave a rough indica-
tion of the time.

Eventually people
learned how to prepare a
circular bowl with the
hours marked off on the
rim and with a gnomon in
the center that was tilted
due north. The shadow
then stayed the same
length as it traveled from
west to east around the rim
of the bowl. This greatly in-
creased the convenience
and use of sundials.

Sundials of this sort ap-
peared in Egypt at least as
early as 700 B.c. (We still
find them in modern gar-
dens, by the way, not to tell
the hours but as orna-
ments.)

     

man or the painfully accu-
mulated store of a scholar.
Only monarchs with the re-
sources of kingdoms behind
them could accumulate
large libraries in the mod-

ern sense.
The first such monarch
that we know of was Ashur-
banipal (see 2500 B.c.). He
arranged to have every
book in his kingdom copied

   
 

and the copy placed in his
library at Nineveh. He
ended up with thousands of
books, all carefully cata-
loged.

Coins

Trading originally con-
sisted of barter: you give
me this and I will give you
that. If two people both had
something they didn’t need
that the other badly
wanted, the trade was easy.
Usually, however, both
sides wanted to make sure
they didn't give up some-
thing more valuable for
something less valuable.
Since comparative values
are hard to judge, there
must have been many
times when both traders
felt cheated.

Eventually the custom

arose of using metals, espe-
cially gold, as a medium of
exchange. Gold was b
ful and much to be desired
as ornamentation. It didn't

In all transactions, it
was then necessary to have
a scale (see 5000 B.c.) that
could be used to weigh lit-
tle odds and ends of gold,
with the usual fears on all
sides that the scale, or the
weights, might be crooked.
In western Asia Minor,
the kingdom of Lydia was
founded about 680 B.c. by
Gyges, who ruled till about

Eclipses

In studying the motion of
the planets along the path
of the zodiac, the Babylo-
nian astronomers could not
help but note that some-
times the motions would

bring two of them fairly
close together. This would
be most spectacular in the
case of the Sun and the
Moon. Every once in @
while the Moon would pass
in front of the Sun and ob
scure part or sometimes all

of it. At times, too, the Sun

 

 

 

would be on one side of the
Ear and the Moon would
be directly on the other
The Earth's shadow would
then fall on the Moon, ob
seuring ir. Thus, ther

could be either
 

eclipse or a lunar eclipse.
(Eclipse is from Greek
words meaning “to leave
out,” since when one hap-
pened, the Sun or the Moon
would seem to be left out of
the sky.)

An eclipse is a frighten-
ing spectacle. Those who
become aware of it may ac-
tually think that the Sun or
the Moon is dying, with in-
calculable consequences.
Even if it is understood
that the Sun or Moon is
only obscured temporarily,
there is a feeling that it is
an omen of evil sent by the
gods as a warning.

Elements

Thales (see 585 B.c.) was
the first to ask himself what
the Universe was made of
and to seek an answer that
did not depend on gods or
the supernatural. He thus

  

 

However, by studying
the movements of the Sun
and Moon, early astrono-
mers learned to predict
when eclipses would take
place. Since that made the
eclipses appear to be auto-
matic and unavoidable phe-
nomena, it removed their
unexpected and ominous
connotations. (There is
some feeling that even pre-
historic watchers of the sky
learned to tell when lunar
eclipses would occur, and
that the stones at Stone-
henge in southwestern En-
gland were arranged as a
kind of observatory that al-

represents the birth of ratio-
nalism.

His answer, which he
may have reached about
580 B.c., was that all matter
was fundamentally water,
and that everything that
did not seem to be water

lowed prediction of such
phenomena.)

The Greek philosopher
Thales (624-546 B.c.) seems
to have learned the Babylo-
nian methods and pre-
dicted an eclipse of the
Sun, one that we now know
(by calculating backward)
took place on May 28, 585
B.c. This added greatly to
Thales’ prestige and also
helped make eclipses less
frightening, since they were
demonstrated to be predict-
able.

  

originated in water or was
modified water. Water was
thus, in his opinion, the pri-
mary element (from a Latin
word of uncertain mean-
ing), or fundamental sub-
stance, of the Earth.

Irrational
Numbers

The Greek philosepher Py-
thagoras (ca. 580—ca. 500
B.c.) believed that whole
numbers, including frac-
tions, since they are ratios
of whole numbers, were the
basis of the Universe. Thus,
¥4 is the ratio of 3 to 4. If
you begin with 3 pies and
divide them equally among
4 people, each person gets
*ls of a pie. Whole numbers
and fractions together
make up the rational num-
bers (those that can be ex-
pressed as ratios), and it is
easy Lo suppose that ratio-

nal numbers are all that
exist.

However, suppose you
have a right triangle with
each side equal to 1 unit.
What is the length of the hy-
potenuse? The answer can
be obtained by remember-
ing that the square of the
hypotenuse is equal to the
sum of the squares of the
sides. This was long known,
but Pythagoras worked out
a good proof and it is called
the Pythagorean theorem as
aresult.

The square of each side
is 1, so the square of the hy-
potenuse is 2, and the
length of the hypotenuse is
the square root of 2, or that

number which, when
multiplied by itself, equals
2. The number 7% is nearly
right, since 75 x s = 2.04.
The number /s is even
closer, since fso0 X "7/spo is
a little over 1.999.

[t can be shown quite
easily, just the same, that
there is no fraction, no frac-
tion at all, however compli-
cated, that when multiplied
by itself gives exactly 2.
The square root of 2 is
therefore not a rational
number. It is an irrational
nutimber, and as it turns out,
there are an infinite num-
ber of such irrationals.

Maps

Egyptians and Babylonians
alike attempted to draw
maps of the world they
knew. In early times, how-
ever, traveling was diffi-
cult, and most people
either knew only their im-
mediate neighborhood or, if
they traveled, had difficulty
keeping directions and dis-
tances in mind.

500 B.C.

Atlantic Ocean

The Phoenician navigators,
who had made themselves
at home the length and
breadth of the Mediterra-
nean over the past six cen-
turies, even ventured
through what we now call
the Strait of Gibraltar

 

The first map that we
can recognize as having
some vague relation to real-
ity was drawn by a Greek
traveler named Hecataeus
(6th—5th century B.c.). He
had the advantage of living
after the Persian Empire had
been firmly established, so
that it was possible for him
to travel for thousands of
miles without encountering
war or disorder,

and into the Atlantic

Ocean.

One of the driving
forces behind them was the
depletion of eastern Medi-
terranean tin mines, since
tin is a rather rare metal.
(This was the first time that
human beings had to con-
tend with the loss of a nec-

    

Hecataeus drew a map
about 510 B.c. in which the
land area of the world was
shown as a circle, with the
sea around it. An arm of the
sea cuts halfway into the
circle from the west. It is
the Mediterranean. Europe
lies to the north, Africa to
the south, and Asia to the
east.

   

essary resource.) Since tin
was an essential compo-
nent of bronze, it had to be
obtained somewhere; if not
in the Mediterranean lands,
then elsewhere.

The Phoenicians found
Tin Islands somewhere in
the Atlantic. They kept the
location secret in order to
 

retain a monopoly of the

tin ore, but it is thought
that they reached Cornwall,
at the southwestern tip of
England, where tin ore was
produced right into modern
times.

By 500 B.c., the Phoeni-
cians are even reported to
have circumnavigated Af-
rica, a voyage that took
them three years. The
Greek historian Herodotus
(ca. 484—between 430 and
420 B.c.), writing half a cen-
tury later, described the
voyage but doubted the
whole thing because the
Phoenicians reported that
in the far south the noon-
day Sun was in the north-
ern half of the sky.
Herodotus felt this to be im-
possible.

We moderns, however,
know that the Sun is al-
ways in the northern half of
the sky when seen from the
South Temperate Zone. The
Phoenicians would not
have made up such an ap-
parently ridiculous story if
they had not actually wit-
nessed it, so the very item
that caused Herodotus
to doubt the story con-
vinees us that it must be
true.

Dissection

The interior of a human
body cannot ordinarily be
seen. Animals, however,
have been butchered since

dim prehistory, so that
much was known of animal
organs. There were also sug-
gestions that one could fore-
tell the future by studying
animal livers, for instance,
which meant that studies of
animal anatomy (from
Greek words meaning “to
cut up”) were more de-
tailed and careful than one
would expect from the pro-
cess of butchering.

However, one cannot
treat a dead human being
as one would treat a dead
animal. There is a feeling
that human beings should
be treated with respect,
even if dead. Some human
beings might be hurt and
cut open in the course of
wars, private fights, or
hunting, but the studies
this made possible could
only be limited and unsys-
tematic.

A Greek physician, Alc-
maeon (6th century B.c.)
was the first to take the
chance of deliberately and
carefully dissecting human
cadavers, possibly about
500 B.c. In this way, he
could see the difference be-
tween arteries and veins
and tell that the sense or-
gans were connected to the
brain by nerves.

Abacus

No one knows when the
abacus first came into use,
but it was probably known

in Egypt at least as long
ago as 500 B.c.

It consists essentially
of rows of beads, some-
times strung on wires. In
the simplest form there are
ten beads on each wire, the
first row being units, the
second row being tens, the
third row being hundreds
and so on.

The beads can be ma-
nipulated much as we ma-
nipulate the fingers on a
hand in simple adding and
subtracting. The advantage
is that you may have nine
or ten "“hands” present as
so many rows of beads, and
the movements you make
are easier and quicker than
manipulating your fingers
would be.

A skilled operator can
use the abacus flashingly to
multiply, to divide, and 1o
perform many complicated
arithmetical manipula-
tions, It was the first really
important computing de-
vice worked out by human
beings.

Venus

The Greeks were not, at
first, as advanced in astron-
omy as the Babylonians
were. They knew the eve-
ning star, a bright planet
that appeared in the west-
ern sky aflter sunset, and
they called it Hesperos (the
Greek word for “evening'').
There was also a morning
star, a bright planet that ap-
peared in the eastern sky
before sunrise, and they
called it Phosphoros (the
Greek word for “light-
bringer,” because once it
appeared, the Sun was not
far behind).

Pythagoras (see 520

480 B.C.

B.c.) was the first Greek to
realize the two were the
same object, since when the
evening star was in the sky
there was no morning star
and vice versa. (He is sup-
posed to have traveled in
Babylonia, and he may
have learned this there.)

About 500 B.c., he named
this single planet, which
swung from one side of the
Sun to the other and back
again, Aphrodite, after the
Greek goddess of love and
beauty. The Romans (and
we) called it by their equiv-
alent, Venus.

 

 

Dreams

Dreams have always
seemed to human beings to
be a doorway into some
strange and different

world. Dreams in which
people who were dead ap-
peared and seemed to live
and speak might have given
rise to notions of ghosts
and a spirit world, and rein-
forced belief in a life hereaf-

ter. Dreams that made
little sense might seem like
obscure messages from di-
vine beings. Dreams are de-
scribed as messages from
Zeus in Homer, and as mes-
sages from God in both the
0Old and New Testaments.
The Greek philoso-
phers, however, were wed-
ded to rationalism. They
felt that the Universe ran
according to laws of nature

that could be understood

. by observation and reason-

ing and did not require any
supernatural force—that is,
any force outside of or supe-
rior to the laws of nature.

Thus, about 480 B.c.,
the Greek philosopher Her-
acleitus (ca. 540—ca. 480
B.C.) maintained that
dreams had no meaning
outside a person’s own
thoughts.
440 B.C.

 

Atoms

The Greek philosopher Leu-
cippus (5th century B.C.)
was the first to state cate-
gorically that every event
has a natural cause. This
rules out all intervention
by the supernatural and
represents the scientific
view held today.
Leucippus'’s student
Democritus (ca. 460—ca.

370 B.c.) adopted and ex-

tended Leucippus’s notions.

He maintained, from about
440 B.C., as Leucippus had
earlier, that all matier was
composed of tiny particles
so small that nothing
smaller was conceivable,
Hence they were in-
divisible, and he called
them atoms from a Greek
word meaning “indivisi-
ble.”

Of course Leucippus
and Democritus had no evi-
dence for their atomistic
views. They were only spec-
ulations, and most other
philosophers of the time ve-
hemently rejected them. It
was to be two thousand
years before atomistic
views began to gain ascen-
dancy.
 

420 B.C.

 

Epilepsy

Following the rationalist
view, the Greek physician
Hippocrates (ca. 460—ca.
377 B.c.) maintained that
all diseases had natural
causes and were not to be
viewed as divine visitations
or punishments.

In particular, about
420 B.c., he applied this
rule to epilepsy, a disease

400 B.C.

Catapults

The Greeks of this period
were good at war. They had
developed hoplites (from a
Greek word for “heavy
shield”), or heavily armed
foot soldiers. The hoplites’
helmets, breastplates, and
leg armor were made of
good steel. They carried a
shield on one arm (instead
of around the neck) and a
sword in the other. They
also had long spears to

 

whose sufferers were likely
to fall to the ground sud-
denly and behave as though
they were no longer in con-
trol of their moaning,
twitching bodies. It was
called the “sacred disease,”
and epileptics were thought
to be in the grip of gods or
demons. Hippocrates, on
the other hand, sought a
physical cure or ameliora-
tion.

thrust with, rather than to
hurl. They were trained to
fight in close formation as a
unit—it was not the indi-
vidual champion but the
weight of the entire forma-
tion that counted. A line of
hoplites could wipe out the
lightly armed disorderly
mob that made up most
non-Greek infantry, and it
was for that reason that the
Greeks managed to defeat
the enormous Persian Em-
pire.

 

Hippocrates believed
that health depended on
the proper balance of the
four humors (or fluids) of
the body: blood, phlegm,
bile, and black bile. In this
he was wrong, but at least
he sought the cause of dis-
ease among natural phe-
nomena, and in that he was
not wrong.

  

The most important
Greek city in the West was
Syracuse, on the eastern
coast of Sicily, which
reached its period of great-
est power under Dionysius
(reigned 405-367 B.c.). He
encouraged work on new
weapons, and about 400
B.C. his workers devised the
catapult (from Greek words
meaning “‘to hurl down").
In its first form it was like a
giant bow that was immo-
bile and took many men to

    
cock. When it was released,
however, it hurled down
upon a city's walls, not a lit-
tle arrow but a huge rock—
or hurled it over the wall
and into the city

It was the first long-
range weapon that could

hurl heavy objects, or the
first piece of a

long-range weapon)

Advanced
Schools

The Greek philosopher
Plato (ca. 428—ca. 348 or
347 B.c.) founded a school
in the western suburbs of
Athens in 387 B.c. Intended
for advanced study, it
might be called the world's
first university. Because it
was on the grounds that
had once belonged to a leg-
endary Greek named Acade-

mus, it came to be called
the Academy.

Plato’s pupil Aristotle
(384—-322 B.c.) founded a
school of his own in Athens
in 335 B.c. It was called the
Lyeceum, because the build
ing it occupied had been
dedicated to Apollo Lyceus,
god of shepherds. Aris
totle’s lectures at the school
were collected into nearly a
hundred and fifty volumes,

Other Centers
of the Universe

At this time it seemed obvi-
ous to almost everybody
that the Earth was solid,
immeovable, and the center
of the Universe, with every-
thing in the sky moving
about it. It certainly looked
that way, and why should
the evidence of one's eyes
be denied?

Nevertheless, the Greek
philosopher Philolaus (5th
century B.c.), a student of
Pythagoras (see 520 B.c.),
felt that the Earth, with all
the visible planets includ-
ing the Sun, rotated about
a central fire, which could
not be seen. He was the first
person we know of to sug-
gest that the Earth moved
and was not at the center of
the Universe, but his sug-
gestion was more mystical
than rational and it won lit-
tle credence.

The Greek astronomer
Heracleides Ponticus (ca.
390-after 322 B.c.) did not

go so far. He felt the Earth
was the immovable center
of the Universe, but he
pointed out, about 350 B.c.,
that Mercury and Venus
were never very far from
the Sun. This could be ac-
counted for by schemes the
Greeks worked out that had
each planet circling inde-
pendently about the Earth,
but to do so was difficult.
Heracleides maintained
that it was much simpler to
suppose that Mercury and
Venus circled the Sun, and
that the Sun, with these
two subsidiary bodies in at-
tendance, circled the Earth.
He was the first to suggest
that there was at least
some heliocentrism to the
Universe, that at least some
bodies revolved about the
Sun and only secondarily
about the Earth.

.
Logic
Everyone reasons after a
fashion. It is impossible not

to. Primordial hunters
would reason from foot-

prints that an animal had
passed that way and would
identify it from the nature
of the markings. Every-
thing you do, if you are in a
normal state of mind, has
some reason behind it. Un-
fortunately, however, there
are innumerable ways of
reasoning in a faulty man-
ner, and reasoning in gen-
eral can be swayed by
emotions, by self-interest,
and so on. The result is that
people frequently, and
under some circumstances
almost always, behave in
an irrational manner.

Aristotle (see 387 B.c.)
was the first thinker we
know of who undertook to
work out a legitimate sys-
tem of reasoning (logie,
from the Greek for “word").
His book Organon devel-
oped the study of logic in
great and satisfying detail,
describing the art of reason-
ing from premise to neces-
sary conclusion and
thereby demonstrating how
to establish the validity of a
line of thought.

 
 

 

Spherical Earth

Anyone looking at the
Earth can see that the land
surface is bumpy and un-
even but on the whole flat.
This is particularly true if
we look out over the surface
of a lake.

The first person we
know of who seems to have
suggested that the Earth
was not flat but spherical
was Pythagoras (see 520
B.c.). It was Aristotle (see
387 B.c.), however, who
summarized the reasons,
possibly about 350 B.c., rea-
sons that still hold today.

As one moves north,
stars rise above the north-
ern horizon and sink below
the southern horizon, while
as one moves south, the re-
verse happens. The shadow
of the Earth on the Moon
during a lunar eclipse is al-
ways a circular arc. When
ships sail away from you at
sea, the hull always seems
to disappear before the su-
perstructure, and this hap-
pens in the same way in
any direction. All these indi-
cate the Earth to be spheri-
cal.

These arguments were
accepted by educated peo-
ple even at low points in in-
tellectual history, yet there
are people today, with an
education of sorts, who
cling to something equiva-
lent to a Flat-Earth Society.
This, of all antiscience

movements, secems the
most indefensible, and one
suspects that they are ei-
ther joking or just a little
mad.

Five Elements

Aristotle (see 387 B.c.) also
summarized earlier
thoughts on the elements of
which the world was com-
posed. Thales (see 580 B.c.)
had suggested that it was
composed of water, while
later philosophers had
named other candidates.

Aristotle suggested that
it was made of four ele-
ments—earth, water, air,
and fire—and that it was
built in consecutive shells.
At the center was a ball of
earth, surrounded by a ball
of water (through which
some earth protruded in
places). This was in turn
surrounded by a ball of air,
and then, still farther out,
by a ball of fire (sometimes
visible as lightning).

The heavens them-
selves, however, were fun-
damentally different from
the world, in Aristotle’s
view, and were made up of
a fifth element, which he
called aether (from a Greek
word meaning “blazing"’).
After all, the heavenly bod-
ies were all luminous, while
the world was dark, except
when it rellected light. The
heavenly bodies moved in
endless circles, while on

Earth bodies fell or rose.
The heavenly bodies were
unchanging and incorrupt-
ible, while on Earth every-
thing changed and
deteriorated.,

This view of Aristotle’s
turned out to be wrong, but
to this day we still speak of
“hghting the elements”
when we face wind and
rain, and when we want to
say that something is the
pure and abstract represen-
tation of anything we call it
a quintessence, from Latin
words meaning “fifth ele-
ment.”’

Animal
Classification

Aristotle (see 387 B.c.) was
a careful and meticulous
observer who was fasci-
nated by the task of classify-
ing animal species.and
arranging them into hierar-
chies. He dealt with over
five hundred animal species
in this way and dissected
nearly fifty of them. His
mode of classification was
reasonable and in some
ways strikingly modern,

He was particularly in-
terested in sea life. He ob-
served that the dolphin
brought forth its young
alive, nourishing its voung
by a special organ called a
placenta before birth and
by milk after it was born.
No fish did this, but all
mammals did, so Aristotle
classified the dolphin with
the beasts of the field
rather than with the fish of
the sea. It took biologists
generally about two thou-
sand years to catch up with
Aristotle in this regard.
Classification is im-
portant in itself, for it helps
to organize a field of study.
In the case of biology it was

particularly important, for
it led eventually to
thoughts of biological evo-
lution.

Star Maps

The Greek mathematician
Eudoxus (ca. 400—ca. 350
B.C.), perhaps about 350

B.C., drew a better map of
the Earth than Hecataeus

had managed (see 510 B.c.),
and was the first to attempt
a map of the sky.

The sky was more dif-
ficult to map than the
Earth was. On Earth there
were physical landmarks:
coastlines, rivers, mountain
ranges, and so on. In the
sky there were only stars.

The reasonable thing to
do was to create landmarks,

 
 

so Eudoxus drew imagi- ing the first set at right angles are latitude. In this

 

nary lines diverging out angles. The diverging lines way Eudoxus could locate
from the pole star, and are what we now call longi- stars unmistakably in the
other imaginary lines meet- tude, and the ones at right otherwise featureless sky.

Roads

Once carts were developed,
roads were needed. Vehi-
cles could not progress rap-
idly over rocks and
underbrush, and if they
tried, the wheels would be
quickly ruined. That meant
that everywhere roads, rea-
sonably wide, reasonably
straight, and reasonably
smooth, had to be built.
This Rome understood.

In the years after its hu-
miliation by the Gauls,
Rome had perfected the le-
gion, which was a much
more flexible formation
than the phalanx. The pha-

lanx could only fight in
close order, and any une-
venness in the ground
would upset that order. The
legion, on the other hand,
could disperse on uneven
ground without falling into
disarray and could come to-
gether again when condi-
tions allowed.

In 312 B.c. Appius Clau-
dius (4th—3rd century B.C.),
a high Roman official, initi-
ated the building of the Ap-
pian Way, the best road the
world had yet seen. It ex-
tended from Rome to
Capua, a distance of 132
miles. At first it was cov-
ered by gravel, but eventu-

ally it was paved with
blocks of stone and ex-
tended to the heel of Italy.

The road allowed for
the rapid movement of
troops and gave Rome an
enormous advantage in
bringing up reinforcements
or achieving surprise. Even-
tually Rome would build
50,000 miles of roads
throughout its dominions.
Some were over 30 feet
wide. This meant that
Roman armies could be
hurried from one border to
another at quick step, and
relatively small forces
could protect its bound-
aries.

Geometry

Geometry, as a practical
study, may have begun in
Egypt, where the building
of pyramids and the neces-
sity of reestablishing
boundaries after the Nile
flood made it essential. The
Greeks made it theoretical,
however, working with
ideal points, lines, curves,
planes, and solids. They at-
tempted to prove things by
reason alone and without
actual measurement. (Rea-
son was the mark of the phi-
losopher; measurement was
only for the artisan, and the
Greek scholars were snobs.
Snobbery turned out to be
useful in mathematics,
though not in experimental
science, where the Greeks
fell badly short.)

A number of Greek
mathematicians contrib-
uted to the development of
geometry, particularly Eu-
doxus (see 350 B.c., Star
Maps). It was Euclid (fl. ea.
300 B.c.) who brought geom-
etry to maturity, however.
He worked in Alexandria,
Egypt, and thereby hangs a
tale.

The city of Alexandria,
on the seacoast at the west-
ernmost branch of the Nile
delta, had been founded by

Alexander III (see 320 B.c.)
and named after himself. It
was a largely Greek city,
though it contained many
Egyptians and Jews as
well. It quickly became the
largest and most cosmopoli-
tan city of the Greek world.
Ptolemy I (ca. 366—ca. 283
B.c.), who ruled over Egypt
after Alexander’s death, es-
tablished his capital at Al-
exandria.

Ptolemy I saw himself
as a patron of the arts and
sciences and founded the
Museum, so-called because
it was an institution de-
voted to the Muses, the pa-
tron goddesses of learning.
He and his son, Ptolemy II
(308-246 B.c.), made the
Museum the largest and
most important of all the
ancient universities. Associ-
ated with it was the largest
of all the ancient libraries.

The Prolemies encour-
aged scientists and thinkers
generally to come to Alex-
andria and subsidized them
well. Euclid, a Greek math-
ematician who may have
studied at the Academy,
moved from Athens to Alex-
andria as a result, symboliz-
ing the "brain drain’ that
followed, as Greeks poured
out of Greece proper into
the new dominions of the

Hellenistic kingdoms that
succeeded Alexandria.

Perhaps about 300 B.c.,
Euclid began compiling all
the geometrical [indings of
earlier mathematicians
into a textbook eventually
called Elements. He added
comparatively little him-
self, but what he did was be-
yond price.

He began with a mini-
mum number of statements
that were so self-cvident
that they required no proof.
From these axioms, he pro-
ceeded systematically to
prove theorem after theo-
rem, each prool depending
only on the axioms and on
previous proofs, so that ge-
ometry was given a firm
foundation and structure.

It was the most suceess-
ful textbook ever written
and has been used, in more
or less modified form, to
this day.

Tides

The Greeks were not quite
the sea-voyagers the Phoe-
nicians had been, though
by this time they could fol-
low the Phoenicians’ path
and sail all over the Medi-
terranean. Only one Greek,
Pytheas ({1. 300 B.c.). fol-
lowed the Phoenicians out
 

of the Mediterranean and
into the Atlantic, however.
He too sailed north to
the British Isles and even
farther north to Thule,
which may have been ei-
ther Norway or Iceland. He
also sailed past Denmark
and into the Baltic. His
tales of what he had seen,
although moderns find
them authentic-sounding,
met with disbelief on the
part of his contemporaries,
and nothing came of his ex-
plorations.

Brain
The Museum at Alexandria
was the site of important
early work on anatomy by
Herophilus (ca. 355—ca. 280
B.c.) and his successor, Era-
sistratus (fl. 250 B.c.). Both
were particularly inter-
ested in the brain and the
nerves. About 280 B.c., Her-
ophilus divided nerves into

sense impressions) and

 

   

standpoint, the most im-
portant observations he
made were of the tides. The
Mediterranean is a virtu-
ally tideless sea, because by
the time some of the high
tidal water flows through
the narrow Strait of Gi-
braltar and raises the sea
level a couple of inches, it
is time for it to flow out
again.

In the Atlantic Ocean,
however, Pytheas observed
the existence of true tides
and described them—and
was disbelieved.

motor (those that stimu-
lated motion). He described
the liver and spleen as well,
described and named the
retina of the eye, and
named the first section of
the small intestine the duo-

arteries pulsed, and
thought that they carried

Arteries

The Greek physician Praxa-
goras (4th century B.c.) dis-
tinguished between the two
kinds of vessels we know as
arteries and veins. How-
ever, he thought arteries
carried air (they are usually
empty in corpses). That
turned out to be wrong, but
the idea remains in the

words meaning "air-car-
rier.” He also noticed that
the brain and the spinal
cord were connected.

 

the brain) and the cerebel-
lum (the smaller section be-
hind it). He was struck by
the fact that the convolu-
tions of the human brain
were more numerous than
those in other animals and
suggested that this was re-
lated to superior human in-
telligence. Unlike
Herophilus, he did not
think the arteries carried
blood.

This promising begin-

   

   
ning came to a sudden end.
The Egyptian population
believed it was necessary to
keep the body intact if a
decent status in the after-
life was to be achieved, and
public opinion forced an
end to all dissection at the
Museum. The study of the
human body ceased for
over fifteen centuries as a
result.

Size of Moon
and Sun

It is easy to suppose that
the heavenly bodies are in-
significant in size com-
pared to the enormous
Earth. After all, the stars
are just specks of light on
the vault of a sky that looks
as though it barely clears
Earth’s high mountains.
The Sun and Moon have vis-
ible orbs, but they seem
small too. To suggest other-
wise would certainly have
been considered foolish, or
worse.

Thus, when the Greek
philosopher Anaxagoras
(ca, 500—ca. 428 B.C.) sug-
gested that the Sun was a
rock the size of southern
Greece, he horrified the
Athenian conservatives,
who accused him of irreli-
gion, brought him to trial,
and forced him into exile.

Two centuries had
passed since then, and the
Greek world had expanded

enormously. With its hori-
zons broadened, daring
thoughts were better toler-
ated, and the Greek astrono-
mer Aristarchus (fl. ca. 270
B.c.) was the first to try to
determine the size of the
heavenly bodies.

About 280 B.c., he
noted the size of the
shadow cast by Earth on
the Moon and, following a
correct line of mathemati-
cal argument, estimated
that the Moon was a body
with a diameter one-third
that of the Earth. His result
was a little high because he
lacked the instruments
with which to measure the
shadow accurately.

Aristarchus also tried
to determine the relative
size of the Moon and the
Sun by trigonometry. He
noted that at the time the
Moon was in its half-phase,
the Moon, Sun, and Earth
were at the apexes of a
right triangle. Thus, if the
angles were measured, the
lengths of the sides could
be calculated. Aristarchus’s
mathematics was correct
but again he was victim-
ized by the lack of instru-
ments with which to make
accurate measurements, He
ended by deciding that the
Sun was twenty times as
far from the Earth as the
Moon was and that the Sun
had therefore seven times
the diameter of the Earth.
This turned out to be a

gross underestimate, but
Aristarchus was neverthe-
less the first to show, by sci-
entific reasoning, that the
heavenly bodies were ob-
jects comparable to the
Earth in size.

A consideration of the
Sun'’s huge size possibly led
Aristarchus to maintain
that the Sun, and not the
Earth, was the center of the
Universe, and that the vari-
ous planets, including the
Earth, revolved about the
Sun. He had no evidence
for this, and the notion did
not convince anyone. Even
if the Sun were a huge
body, it was considered an
insubstantial ball of light,
and the thought of the
solid, heavy Earth revolv-
ing around it seemed ridicu-
lous.

Lighthouse

The Hellenistic realms did
not hesitate to show their
advanced technologies in
the form of large architee-
tural underiakings. The is-
land of Rhodes, for
instance, celebrated its suc-
cessful resistance to a siege
by a Macedonian general in
305-304 B.c. by having a
large statue of the Sun-god
constructed overlooking its
harbor. That statue was
105 feet high and was com-
pleted in 280 B.c. [t was
called the Colossus of
Rhiodes. 1t stood for sixty
years before being de-
stroyed by an earthquake,
and after its destruction its
size was greatly exagger-
ated.

In Alexandria a much
more useful and even larger
structure was built, the
first major lighthouse. It
was called the Pharos from

270 B.C.

Water Clock

The sundial gave people an
idea of the passage of
hours, but it did so only by
day when the sun was out,
and it wasn't portable.
Other ways of measur-
ing time were also used,
since any process that re-
mained steady over a pe-
riod of time would serve
the purpose at least
crudely. There was the
hourglass, in which fine,
dry sand dripped from an
upper chamber to a lower
one in a known time. There

on which it was built. Tt
was at least 280 feet high,
rested on a bulky square
base, and had stairs up
which loads of resinous
wood had to be carried. (No
elevators, of course.) The
light of the burning wood
could be seen 35 miles out

 

were candles that burned
down a given length in a
known time, which could
be marked off to indicate
the passage of hours. In
Egypt and in China, water
dripping from an upper
chamber to a lowerone had
long been used as a way of
telling time.

About 270 B.c., a Greek
inventor, Ctesibius (2d cen-
tury B.c.), devised a model
of the water clock that
gained great popularity. It
included a float in the
water, which rose as the

water in the lower chamber

to sea. It, too, was com-
pleted in 280 B.c. and it
stood for sixteen centuries
before being destroyed by
an earthquake.

Both the Colossus of
Rhodes and the Pharos
were listed by the ancients
as among the Seven Won-
ders of the World.

 

accumulated. This float
was attached to a notched
rod that turned a gear as it
pushed upward, which in
turn twisted a pointer that
marked off numbers from 1
to 12. The Greeks called the
device a clepsydra (water-
stealer), since the water qui-
etly leaked out of the upper
chamber.

Water clocks could tell
time well enough to govern
the length of time a person
might talk in court or be-
fore an assembly, but they
were nevertheless crude
timepieces at best.

Lever

Levers were used in prehis-
toric times. It is no great
trick for a lively mind to
try to pry up a rock with a
long stick and to find that it
works better if another,
smaller rock is placed
under the stick to give the
stick something to push
against. It would then
quickly be discovered that
the closer the small rock is to
the big rock being pried up,
the easier the prying gets.

Nevertheless, the pre-
cise mathematics of lever
action was not worked out
until the Greek scientist Ar-
chimedes (ca. 287-212 B.c.)
did it about 260 B.c.

You might say, “Whal
difference does it make that
scholars worked out lancy
theories and mathematics
for levers, when practical
people had been actually

using such devices for thou-
sands of years?"

The point is that use
without theory is largely
hit and miss. Advances are
made, yes, but slowly. Once
a useful theory is worked
out, however, it is like re-
moving a blindfold. It be-
comes obvious how a
device might be improved,
or what new observations
need to be made. With a
theory, advances speed up
enormously.

Therefore we give Ar-
chimedes credit for the
principle of the lever, re-
gardless of how long the
lever had been in use before
his time.

Archimedes also
worked oul the principle of
buoyancy, the manner in
which any object immersed
in a fluid displaces a vol-
ume of fluid equal 1o its
own volume. This provided

a way of measuring vol-
ume, a way of explaining
why some things (loat and
some don't, and so on. Ar-
chimedes grasped the prin-
ciple quite suddenly when
he lowered himself into a
public bath and noticed the
water overflow.

The storv is that he
sprang out of the bath and
raced home nude, shouting
“Eureka! Eureka!” (“I have
it! [ have it!"). He had been
given the problem of check-
ing whether a golden crown
was adulterated with a less
dense metal or not, without
damaging the crown. For
that he had 1o know the val-
ume, and the buovaney el-
fect would give it to him.
(The ancient Greeks, by the
way, did not mind nudity,
so Archimedes” action was
not as bizarre as might be
thought.)
240 B.C.

 

Size of Earth

Even after the Earth was
known to be spherical,
there was the question of
how large that sphere
might be. It was bound to
be huge, since no traveler
had ever been totally
around it. There was al-
ways more Earth, unknown
and as yet unvisited, up
ahead.

But then a Greek
scholar, Eratosthenes (ca.
276—ca. 194 B.Cc.), working
at Alexandria, found a way
to measure the Earth'’s cir-
cumference without leaving
Egypt. At the summer sol-
stice, he had been told, the
Sun at noon cast no
shadow at the city of Syene
(modern Aswan), which
was far south of Alexan-
dria. That meant that the
Sun was then directly over-
head at Syene. At the same
time, though, the Sun was

7 degrees from the zenith in
Alexandria. This difference
had to result from the fact
that the Earth curved be-
tween Syene and Alexan-
dria. Knowing the north-
south distance from Syene
to Alexandria, Eratosthenes
could use mathematics to
calculate how far it would
take the curvature of the
Earth, worked out between
Syene and Alexandria, to
take him all the way
around the Earth.

He came out with a
length of 25,000 miles for
Earth’s circumference. He
was correct.

The ancients, however,
thought his figure was too
high and preferred to ac-
cept a lower one.

Chronology

No two political groupings
among the ancients
counted the yearsin the

same way. Usually it was
by strictly local methods—
a given year was “the year
when so-and-so ruled the
city,” or “the seventh year
of King so-and-so.”” Not
only was it difficult to
match the chronologies of
one political unit with an-
other, but even within a
given political unit things
were hazy if you forgot the
order of the rulers or how
long each had ruled.
Eratosthenes (see
above) was the first person
to try to make sense out of
chronology and to match
one system with another.
He did his best to stretch
dating back to the time of
the Trojan War.
Meanwhile, Alexander
the Great's general Seleu-
cus I (ca. 358-281 B.c.) had
marched into Babylon in
312 B.c. and counted that as
year | of the Seleucid Era.
The years were counted up-

 
wards indefinitely after
that without regard to the
succession of monarchs

ancient times is still a bit

Great Wall

Although China had by now
been civilized for some two
thousand years at least,
and though its technology
and science were remark-
able—in some ways they
continued to be in advance
of the West until the begin-
ning of modern times—I
have little to say about it
There are two reasons for
this.

First, in 221 B.C. a new
dynasty began to rule over
China, the Ch'in, the first
emperor of that dynasty
being Shih Huang Ti (259
210 B.c.). Shih Huang Ti
was a reforming emperor
who wanted to make a new
start and therefore had all
books burned (except for
those in the practical arts)

to free the land from the
stultifying hand of the past
And indeed, the land took
its name, China, from this
dynasty. History before
Shih Huang Ti is most un-
certain because of the de
struction.

threatened by the nomads

only too ready to raid the

would be to build a wall
across the countryside, a

Parchment

Throughout ancient times,
papyrus had been the mate-
rial on which people had
written, but Egypt was the
only source, and the papy-
rus reed could not be grown
quickly enough to supply
the demand. Besides, the
Egyptian rulers were not
anxious to have other na-
tions build up libraries. So

 

mads out, as to keep their
horses out. The nomads
were helpless without their
horses, and though human
beings may climb even a
difficult wall, a horse can-
not.

This wall was begun in
214 B.c. Initially it was of
earth, but later it was made
of brick. It eventually ex-
tended for 1,500 miles,
from the Pacific Ocean to a
point deep in central Asia.

when the small Hellenistic
kingdom of Pergamum in
western Asia Minor, under
Eumenes 11, who ruled
from 197 to somewhere
around 160 B.c., wished to
build a library that would
rival the one at Alexandria,
naturally the Ptolemies
would not cooperate by
shipping the necessary pa-
pyrus.

It had periodic watchtow-
ers, and on the whole it did
its job. China was not made
invulnerable by the Great
Wall but it was surely
made less vulnerable.

The Great Wall is the
largest construction project
ever carried out, the only
object made by human be-
ings that outdoes the pyra-
mids (which were, to be
sure, built twenty-five cen-
turies earlier).

under Eumenes II therefore
invented a new way of treat-
ing hides, about 170 B.C.
Hides had often been used
as writing material, but the
Pergamese learned to
stretch them, scrape them,
and clean them, so that
they ended with a thin
white sheet that could be
covered with writing on
both sides. In later times, it
came to be called parch-

  
  
    
  
 
 
  
  
   
     
ment, which may be a mis-
pronunciation of
Pergamum.

stronger than papyrus and

In astronomy it is neces-

You can only measure the

Hipparchus calculated

Star Map

In 134 B.c. Hipparchus (see
150 B.c.) observed a star in
the constellation Scorpio of
which he could find no re-
cord in previous observa-
tions. This was a serious
matter, for the heavens
were supposed to be eternal
and changeless. Was it
really a new star, or had
Hipparchus simply over-
looked it earlier?
Hipparchus deter-
mined to prepare a star

 

 

30 times the Earth’s
diameter.

If, as Eratosthenes had
determined, Earth had a
circumference of 25,000
miles, it had to have a diam-
eter of 8,000 miles. That
meant that the Moon was
30 x 8,000 miles, or
240,000 miles away (which
is very nearly correct).
That's nearly a quarter of a
million miles away, and yet
the Moon was well known
to be the nearest of the heav-
enly bodies.

any astronomer sighting a
star that seemed new could
check it against the map. In
order to make his map, he
plotted the position of each
star according to its lati-
tude and longitude, as Eu-
doxus had done (see 350
B.C., Star Maps). Hippar-
chus included over a thou-
sand stars, and both in
quantity and in accuracy it
was a far better map than
anything attempted before.
What's more, it occurred to

This was the first indi-
cation that the Universe
was far larger than had
been thought, but it was
also a dead end. Parallaxes
grow smaller as objects
grow more distant, and the
Moon is the only object
close enough to give a mea-
surable parallax to the un-
aided eye.

centered planetary system.

system of latitude and lon-
gitude to maps of the
Earth. That has been done
ever since.

In the course of prepar-
ing his map, Hipparchus
compared the locations of
stars with those recorded
by earlier astronomers and
discovered a uniform shift
of all the stars from west to
east, at a rate that would
bring them completely
around the sky in 26,700
years. Because it meant

  
that the vernal equinox
came a bit ahead of its pre-
vious mark each year, this
motion was called the pre-
cession of the equinoxes.

long, and in this respect the
Julian calendar was an im-
provement over the Egyp-
tian. (The Julian calendar,
with a small correction
made sixteen centuries
later, is still in use today.)

Earth’s Zones

Anyone who traveled was
bound to find that the cli-
mate was different in differ-
ent places. In the north
European forest, it was
colder than it was in
Greece, with longer, snow-
ier winters. In Egypt it was
warmer than in Greece,
and cold weather was rare.

The idea was formal-
ized by the Roman geogra-
pher Pomponius Mela (1st
century A.p.) about A.p. 25.
(From now on, any dates
not marked B.c. will be o.p.)
Pomponius Mela, accepting
a spherical Earth, sug-
gested that it be divided
into a North Frigid Zone
and a South Frigid Zone in
the neighborhood of the

poles, a Torrid Zone in the
neighborhood of the Equa-
tor, and a North Temperate
Zone and a South Temper-
ate Zone in between. This
notion still holds today,
even though variations in
climate are far more com-
plicated than would be
thought from a consider-
ation of zones alone.

Pharmacology

The Greek physician Peda-
nius Dioscorides (ca. 40—ca.
90) served in the Roman ar-
mies and had an opportu-
nity to study the plant life
in large parts of the Medi-
terranean world. He was in-
terested chiefly in the
medical applications of
plants, and in his book De
Materia Medica, he de-
scribed about six hundred

 

plants and nearly a thou-
sand drugs. This was the
first important work on
pharmacology (from Greek
words meaning “the study
of drugs”).

Steam Power

Although Alexandria was
now Roman and well past
its great days, the Museum
and the Library still ex-

isted, and a Greek engineer,

Hero (1st century), worked
there at about this time.
Hero constructed a hollow
sphere to which two bent
tubes were attached, the
openings pointing in oppo-
site directions. When water
was boiled in the sphere,
the steam escaped through
the tubes and, as a result of
what we now call the law
of action and reaction,
caused the sphere to rotate
rapidly. (The modern lawn
sprinkler works in precisely
this fashion, using the force
of flowing water rather
n steam.)
Hero had produced a
steam engine. This does not

Geocentric
Universe

Claudius Ptolemaeus (2d
century), better known as
Ptolemy, was the last im-
portant astronomer of the
ancient world. He wrote a
summary of ancient astron-
omy, known later to the
Arabs as Almagest (the
greatest). He drew largely
from Hipparchus.

In this synthesis, he de-
scribed the Earth as the
center of the Universe and
all the planets as going
around it in combinations
of circular motions. In
order to account for the visi-
ble motions of the planets
across the skies, those com-
binations of circular mo-
tions had to be complicated
indeed, but Ptolemy
worked out mathematical
methods for predicting

planetary motions that
seemed adequate to his con-
temporaries and to future
generations for fourteen
centuries. (His chief instru-
ment was an astrolabe, a
device for determining the
latitude of the heavenly
bodies. It had been in-
vented a couple of centuries
before and is considered
the oldest of scientific in-
struments.)

Spinal Cord

A Greek physician, Galen
(129-ca. 199), worked at a
gladiatorial school at Perga-
mum, the city of his birth,
and there was able to gain
some rough-and-ready

hints on human anatomy.
In Rome, from 161 on, he
could dissect only animals,
which misled him now and
then as far as human anat-
omy was concerned.
Nevertheless, he did
good work on muscles, iden-

tifying many for the first
time, and showed that they
worked in groups. He also
showed the importance of
the spinal cord by cutting it
at various levels in animals
and noting the extent of the
resulting paralysis.

He is best known for
problems that had to be
solved with whole num-
bers, and such problems in-

volve what are still called
Diophantine equations. He
also showed that fractions
could be treated as num-

bers, thus reducing much of
the discomfort they usually
caused.

Alchemy

Creating chemical change
has been part of human life
from the start. Cooking in-
volved chemical changes
and so did fermentation.
The production of pottery
out of clay, metals out of
ore, charcoal out of wood,
and glass out of sand all in-
volved chemical changes.

It was not until the
years after Alexander the
Great (see 320 B.c.), how-
ever, that scholars began to
study chemical change sys-
tematically. This may have
been the result of a fusion
of Greek and Egyptian
thinking, and it flourished
first in Ptolemaic Egypt.

As Euclid, in Egypt,
summarized ancient geom-
etry, and Ptolemy, again in
Egypt, summarized ancient
astronomy, so Zosimus
(240-?), also in Egypt,

about the year 300, summa-
rized ancient alchemy.

The early work in al-
chemy was highly mystical
and not very useful and was
sidetracked eventually ina
vain effort to find some way
of changing "‘base metals,"”
such as lead or iron, to
gold. Nevertheless, inquir-
ing minds, even when mis-
led, could not help making
some discoveries in the
long run, and this the alche-
mists did.

Stirrups

The Greeks and Romans re-
lied on infantry. Stolid,
well-trained foot soldiers,
whether organized into a
phalanx or a legion, could
withstand horsemen, so
that the cavalry was re-
duced to auxiliary impor-
tance in Greek and Roman
times. Cavalry could charge

in an attempt to panic the
enemy, and could chase the
enemy once a panic had set
it, and could fight each
other, but cavalry rarely de-
cided a battle.

The horse and chariot
had faded in importance as
a larger horse was bred ca-
pable of running with the
full weight of an armed sol-
dier on its back. Saddles
made it easier to sit on a
horse’s bony spine, but
riding was still precarious,
and thrusting with a spear
was dangerous, for if the
thrust was parried the rider
might easily be pushed off
the horse. It was safer to
shoot arrows from a dis-
tance.

In India, about 100 B.C.,
the notion arose of having a
leather loop suspended
from the saddle, into which
the big toes could be thrust
in order to steady the rider.

 

 

 
The Chinese, living in a

C r climate and wea
shoes, needed a wider
into which the whole
might be thrust. By 300,

The Middle Ages (476—1453)

Technological advances
continued to be made in
the Middle Ages. Yet the
light of pure scientific in-
quiry dimmed consider-
ably, especially during the
first five centuries of the pe-
riod, which are often re-
ferred to as a Dark Age.
This was an intensely theo-
logical age, marked by am-
bivalence about science
when its findings seemed to
go against religious teach-
ing. A later resurgence of in-
terest in theoretical science
was dampened by the
Black Death, a devastating
epidemic of bubonic
plague. In the early seventh
century, the center of scien-
tific activity shifted to the
East, as invading Muslims
took control of the Hellenis-
tic cities that were reposito-
ries of Greek learning. Arab
scholars eagerly absorbed
the knowledge in the old
texts, and they did impres-
sive new work in astron-
omy, optics, medicine, and
alchemy, the predecessor of
modern chemistry. Toward
the end of the Middle Ages,
the ancient learning that

the Arabs had collected and
expanded upon came back
to Europe. For most of the
Middle Ages, astronomy
was ignored in the West.
Several new stars were de-
tected by Chinese astrono-
mers, but no one in Europe
noticed them. Porcelain
and the production of silk
were imported from China;
other innovations that may
have been developed inde-
pendently in Europe al-
ready existed in China, The
Chinese apparently had
long known about the direc-
tion-finding properties of
magnetic ore but didn't use
it for navigation. When
Western navigators first did
so in 1180, they created in
the compass a tool that—
because of the subsequent
explorations and European
domination of other cul-
tures—helped determine
the course of history. While
the Vikings had made ear-
lier impressive oceangoing
forays, the Age of Explora-
tion is usually defined as be-
ginning in the early
fifteenth century, when the
Portuguese sent out ships

that sought a sea route to
the Far East. Thus began
what would become a stam-
pede of world exploration
by the European powers.
Perhaps the most dramatic
technological achievement
of the late Middle Ages, one
in which technology served
both religion and art, was
the building of the great ca-
thedrals. Flying buttresses
allowed walls to be higher
and thinner than ever be-
fore, and church interiors
were transformed, suffused
with light that shone
through glorious stained
glass windows. In the thir-
teenth and fourteenth cen-
turies there were stirrings
of renewed interest in scien-
tific inquiry. Planetary ta-
bles formulated under the
patronage of the king of
Castile improved on those
of Ptolemy, and experimen-
tal work on the magnetic
poles constituted a break-
through in scientific meth-
odology. Medical students
again performed dissec-
tions of the human body,
and the first book devoted
to anatomy was published.

Domes

A dome is a semispherical
structure on top of a build-
ing, which looks impressive
in itsell and gives an oppor-
tunity for vertical windows
that will introduce light in-
side. (Skylights on a flat
roof are less impressive and
are a source of weakness.)
The Romans first intro-
duced domes, placing one
on the Pantheon, a building
begun in 27 B.c. This was
the largest dome built be-
fore modern times. It is
heavy, however, and is
built on a circular building,

 

with no openings except

one at lhn‘ Very 1op, so its es-

thetic appeal is limited

About 480 architects in
the East Roman Empire
perfected a system of plac-
ing a hemispherical dome
upon a square support in
such a way that the bottom
of the dome could be
pierced by many windows
without sacrificing its
strength.

This discovery was
given its chance when the
East Roman Emperor Jus-
tinian (who reigned frem
527 to 565) decided to re-
build the church of Hagia

 

Sophia after its destruction

Silk

Chinese legends have it
that silk culture was intro-
duced in China in 2640 B.C.,
but this may be taken with
a certain skepticism.
During the time of the
Roman Empire, silk
reached the Western world
over the Silk Road, which
ran the width of Asia. With
every tribe en route charg-
ing to let the silk through,

 

600

it arrived in Rome worth
its weight in gold. Since the
Roman aristocracy insisted
on silk and on other exotic
luxuries from the East,
however, the trade balance
was heavily against

Rome, and this undoubt-
edly contributed to its
decay.

Then a neo-Persian Em-
pire was formed, which
was so hostile to the Ro-
mans that silk was not al-

lowed to pass through at
all.

Justinian (see 537)
therefore arranged to have
two Persian monks who
had lived in China go there
and bring back silkworm
eggs secreted in hollow
bamboo canes. In 552 Con-
stantinople began silk pro-
duction itself, and from
that time to this the West
has had its own silk.

 

Moldboard
Plows

The Slavs of eastern Eu-
rope were hard-working
peasants who were exposed
in their vast plains to inva-
sion from the north and the
east. Both the Goths and
the Huns dominated them,
and later on, so would
other invaders. (The word

slave may have come from
Slav because they seemed
so easily enslaved.) Never-
theless, they endured and
multiplied and contributed
an important advance.
About 600, they are
supposed to have invented
the moldboard plow. This
had a knife blade, or
cotilter, that cut deep into
the ground, a plowshare
that cut grass and stubble

at ground level, and a
shaped moldboard above
the plowshare that lifted
and turned the soil, This
was a useful device for
damp, moist ground. It
wasn't needed in the light
Mediterranean soil, but as
it slowly spread through
eastern and northern Eu-
rope, food production took
a jump and population
grew.

Porcelain

About 700, the Chinese
learned to make porcelain,
a kind of pottery that was
shiny, almost glassy, very
hard, and very white.

What's more, it rang like a
bell when struck. Porcelain
eventually reached Europe,
where it was known as
china and where it became
the material of choice for
dishes (when it could be af-

forded), replacing wood, or-
dinary pottery, and metal.

About this time, other
products of the Orient were
making their way toward
Europe—notably cotton
and sugar from India.

Acetic Acid

Once the Arabs had con-
quered the territories of the
old Greek Hellenistic king-
doms, they were exposed to
the old Greek books on sci-
ence, and they loved them.
Whereas Greek learning
had been almost forgotten
in western Europe, the
Arabs preserved it and
translated the great books
of Euclid, Aristotle, Ptol-
emy, and others into Ara-
bic. For several centuries
the Arabs were the leading
scientists of the Western

world, excelling in astron-
omy, medicine, and al-
chemy.

The greatest of the Ara-
bian alchemists was Jabir
ibn Hayyan (ca. 721—ca.
815), known to Europeans
later as Geber. He sought
for methods of forming
gold, and also for some mys-
terious dry powder (elixir,
from Arabic words mean-
ing “‘the dry one") that
would do the job. It was
thought that such a magi-
cal substance could also
cure all disease, and it was
known as the elixir of life or

 
 

the panacea (from Greek
words meaning “all-heal-
ing""). Centuries of effort
went into a useless search
for this substance.

Geber, however, in his
researches, also managed
to make important discov-
eries. Up to his time, the
strongest acid known was
vinegar, a dilute solution of
acetic acid. By distilling
vinegar, Geber obtained
purer samples of acetic
acid, which were, natu-
rally, stronger than vine-
gar. This was important,
for until then the one agent

 
known to induce chemical important agent for those brought about by
change was heat. Acids, if change, and they bring heat.

Zero

Human beings had been
manipulating numbers ever
since they had begun writ-
ing, about twenty-three cen-
turies earlier. In general,
there would be a tendency
to make score marks for
units, so that 4 would
be /// /. Different marks
would be introduced for
fives, tens, and fifties, to
avoid having to make too
many score marks. Or else,
as in the case of the Jews
and Greeks, letters of the al-
phabet would be used
(which introduced nonsig-
nificant connections be-
tween words and numbers
and introduced the supersti-
tious folly of numerology).
It might have occurred
to someone to use the same
numbers for units, tens,
hundreds, and so on,
merely placing the num-
bers in different positions

for each level, as on an aba-
cus (see 500 B.c.). No one
tried this positional nota-
tion, however, because no
one thought of using a sym-
bol for an abacus level in
which no beads had been
moved

For example, if you
want to indicate 507 on an
abacus, you move 5 beads
at the hundreds level and 7
at the units level. You can
record the 5 and the 7, but
how do you indicate that
the tens level hasn't been
touched?

About the year 500,
some Indian mathemati-
cian suggested that such an
untouched abacus level be
given a special symbol.
(Our symbol is 0 and we
call it zero.) This meant
that you could no longer
confuse 507 with 57 or 570.
The Arabs may have picked
it up from the Hindus
about the year 700.

 

The first important
mathematician to make use
of this positional notation
was an Arab, Muhammad
ibn Al-Khwarizmi (780—
850), who wrote a book fea-
turing it about 810. (In the
book he coined a term that
in English became algebra.)

The new system slowly
penetrated Europe, which
took centuries to give up its
clumsy Roman numerals
and take up the new Arabic
numerals (although, of
course, the numerals were
Indian to start with). It
took centuries to overcome
the habit of sticking to
something inconvenient
but customary rather than
adopting something good
but new. Still, it was done
in the end, and the transi-
tion democratized arith-
metical computation,
bringing it within reach of
everyone.

Coffee

In many regions of the
world, it is necessary to
treat water before it is safe
to drink. Alcohol will kill
germs, so that many people
drank beer or wine rather
than water. (They didn't
know about germs, but
beer or wine tasted better
anyway.) Others boiled
water and added tea

leaves to get rid of the flat
taste.

The Muslims were not
allowed to drink wine and
didn’t know about tea. Nat-
urally, they would be on
the watch for something.

Coffee may have origi-
nally grown wild in Ethio-
pia in the province of Kalffe
and been brought to south-
ern Arabia. There, in 850,
according to tradition, a

goatherd noticed that his
goats acted frisky after
eating berries of the plant.
He tried it himself, liked
the sensation, and told oth-
ers. In time, people learned
how to roast the beans ob-
tained from the berries,
steep them in boiling
water, and produce coftee.
Centuries later, coffee was
introduced to western Eu-
rope.

Arctic Circle

The Vikings were sea-raid-
ers and the terrors of the
European coasts in the
ninth and tenth centuries,
but they were great sea-ex-
plorers as well. Among Eu-
ropeans, they were the
greatest since the Phoeni-
cians, thirteen centuries
earlier.

A Viking named Ottar
sailed northward in 870 out
of nothing more than sheer
curiosity, apparently. He
said he wanted to see how
far north land existed, and
whether it was populated.
He succeeded in rounding
the northern end of the
Scandinavian peninsula
(North Cape), and sailing
on eastward, he even-

tually entered the White
Sea.

When passing the
North Cape, Ottar was 125
miles north of the Arctic
Circle. He was the first
human being, as far as we
know, ever to cross the Arc-
tic Circle by sea.

Iceland

Between 500 and 800, Ire-
land had experienced a

kind of Golden Age of learn-

ing, which was ended by
the coming of the Vikings.
An Irishman, Brendan
(ca. 484-578), is supposed
to have sailed northward
about 550 and explored the
islands off the Scottish
coast, the Hebrides to the
west and the Shetlands to

900

the north, and he may have
probed further. There are
stories that the Irish
reached Iceland and settled
there, but if so, they did not
stay for long or they died
out

 

In 874 a Viking chief-
tain named Ingolfur Arnar-
son sailed westward and
landed in Iceland, which is
650 miles west of Norway

With moldboard plow (see

Crossbows

The greater the force with
which a bow must be bent,
the greater the force with
which the arrow will be
sent forth when the tension
is released. The greater the
force of the shot, the
greater the range and the
penetrating power. Natu-
rally, the larger the bow, or
the stiffer, the better—ex-
cept that eventually human
muscle doesn't suffice for
pulling back the string of
the bow.

 

1054

In France, sometime
about 1050, machinery was
brought into play: the bow
was drawn back by a two-
handed crank or the equiva-
lent. Eventually the bows
were made of steel, and a
short bolt was shot out that
had a range of about 1,000
feet and could penetrate
chain mail.

This was the first mech-
anized hand weapon, and
the bolt it shot forth
seemed so terrifying that
the weapon seemed too
horrible to use. At least a

Church council of 1139
tried to ban its use except
against non-Christians.
(The ban didn't work.)

The chief disadvantage
of the crossbow was its
slowness. It took a long
time to crank it up and
make ready to shoot and
once it was fired, the enemy
might easily swoop down
before it could be cocked
again. (Hence the expres-
sion “to have shot their
bolt,” meaning to have
taken action and to be help-
less thereafter.)

 

New Star

Hipparchus was supposed
to have seen a new star
some twelve centuries be-
fore (see 134 B.c.), but no
European had seen one
since, though Chinese as-
tronomers had reported a
number of new stars in that
interval.

On July 4, 1054, a

bright new star blazed
forth in the constellation of
Taurus. For three weeks it
shone so brightly it could
be seen in daylight. At its
peak, it was two or three
times as bright as Venus at
its brightest and could cast
a dim shadow. It remained
visible for nearly two years
before finally fading away
into invisibility.

This new star was re-
corded by the Chinese as-
tronomers, but in Europe it
went unnoted (or at least
no reference to it has sur-
vived). This is an indication
of the low state of astron-
omy, and of science gener-
ally, in Europe, which was
just then emerging from a
five-century-long Dark Age.

Comet

Comets made periodic ap-
pearances in the sky. They
were frightening because
they came unheralded and
followed an unpredictable
path. Furthermore, their
shapes were irregular,
rather like a woman's head
with long streaming hair as
though in mourning.

(Comet is from the Greek
word for “hair.”)

The unheralded com-
ing made them appear like
special warnings from
heaven, and the streaming
“hair” made it seem cer-
tain that the warning was
of disaster. Sure enough, di-
saster always came when a
comet blazed in the sky. (Di-
saster always came when

no comet blazed in the sky,
too, but people paid no
heed to that.)

In 1066, there was a
bright comet in the sky that
attracted much attention,
especially because of events
that were than taking place
in Normandy and in En-
gland.

Forks

Knives and spoons are of
prehistoric origin, but forks
are relatively new. Byzan-
tine aristocrats used them
at a time when everyone in
western Europe, high and
low, ate with their fingers.

A Byzantine princess who
married a doge of Venice
brought her forks with her.
The Venetian aristocracy
picked up this obviously
cleanly habit and the fash-
ion spread.

Nevertheless, it did
seem a bit persnickety to

many people, who felt it
was an example of false gen-
tility and prissiness. To this
day we sometimes hear the
phrase “fingers were made
before forks.” So they were,
and so were dirty fingers.

Flying
Buttresses

Roman architects had
found it impossible to build
tall structures without
thick walls. When stone
came to be used for roofs,
the weight was all the heav-
ier and the walls had to be-
come enormously thick.
Nor could there be more
than a few narrow windows
if fatal weaknesses were not
to be introduced. The result

was that the Romanesque
churches of earlier centu-
ries bore a predominant at-
mosphere of squat gloom.
In the twelfth century,
however, the notion arose
of designing large struc-
tures in such a way as to
concentrate the weight of
the roof in certain areas
where outside buttresses of
masonry could be built. For
further strength, buttresses
that stood well away from
the building could be con-
nected to the key points

needing support by
diagonal structures, called
flying buttresses.

Since the buttresses
carried the weight, those
sections of the walls not di-
rectly involved in support
could be left thin and
pierced with numerous win-
dows. When the windows
were filled with stained
glass, the interior of the
structure would be
drenched with colored light
in a beautiful and impres-
sive manner. What's more,
now cathedrals hundreds of
feet high could be built. For
the first time, E
Pyramid was surpassed in
height,

Windmills

The chief source of inani-
mate power continued to
be the waterwheel. Unfortu-
nately, the waterwheel only
worked where a rapidly
flowing stream existed, or
where a stream could be
dammed to produce a wa-
terfall that would turn the
wheel. What was needed
was a source of inanimate
energy not so constrained
Moving air can turn a
vaned wheel as well as mov-
ing water can, and its force

 

was already well under-

stood in connection with
sailing vessels. What's
more, moving air exists
everywhere. The earliest
windmills were developed
in Persia about 700, and re
turning Crusaders brought
back word of these devices
The first windmill was
built in France in 1180 and
windmills quickly spread
over western Europe. The
wheels in the Middle East
had usually been hori
zontal, but those in Europe
were made vertical. The

 

wheels could be turnec

Magnetic
Compasses

In the sixth century

was discover ba sher
herd, ac rd

that a ¢ 1N Kir
was found near the Asia
Minor city of Magnesia, it
came to be called the Mag-
nesian stone, or in English,
a magnet, and the phenome-
non was magnetism. The
phenomenon was first stud-
ied by Thales (see 585 B.c.).
It was eventually found
that stroking with the mag-
netic ore could turn a sliver
of iron or steel into a mag-
net.

Somehow it was dis-
covered that if a magnetic
sliver was allowed to turn
freely, it would come to rest
pointing in a north-south
direction. We don't know
how this fact was discov-
ered, but the Chinese were
the first to be aware of it. It
is referred to in Chinese
books dating as far back as
the second century.

The Chinese never used
the magnet for direction-
finding in navigation, be-
cause by and large they
were not great navigators,
The Arabs may have
learned of it from them,
however, and perhaps some
Crusaders learned of it
from the Arabs.

In 1180 the English
scholar Alexander Neckam
(1157-1217) was the first
European to make refer-
ence to this directional abil-
ity of magnetism. As soon
as the Europeans heard of
it, they began to try to put
it to use as a navigation
aid, and they began to im-
prove it. Eventually a mag-
netic needle was put on a
card marked with various
directions, and because the
needle was free to move all

around the card, it was re-
ferred to as a magnetic com-
pass (from a French word
meaning “to go around”’).
If a single point in time
can be picked as the mo-
ment when Europe first
took the road that was to
lead to world dominion, it
was the moment when Eu-
ropeans heard of the mag-
netic compass and put it to
use. With the compass, Eu-
ropeans could eventually
go wherever they wished
over the wide oceans, so
that they eventually domi-
nated the whole world as
no other relatively small
group of people had ever
done before or (in all likeli-
hood) will ever do again.

Spitzbergen

Icelandic Vikings appar-
ently discovered islands
they called Svalbard (cold
coast), which are perhaps
better known to non-Scan-

dinavians as Spitzbergen
(mountain peaks). These
are 900 miles north of Ice-
land and 500 miles north of
the northern tip of Norway.
They represent the far-
thest point north reached

by the Viking explorers, or
by any ships without com-
passes. The discovery, like
all Viking discoveries, re-
mained unknown to Europe
generally.

Arabic
Numerals

An Italian mathematician,
Leonardo Fibonacci (ca.
1170-after 1240), had occa-

sion to travel widely in

North Africa, since his fa-
ther was a merchant. There
he learned of Arabic numer-
als and positional notation,
which had been advocated
by Al-Khwarizmi (see 810).

Fibonacci wrote a book
on the subject in 1202,

Liber Abaci (Book of the Aba-
cus). This served to intro-

duce Arabic numeral

Coal

The first fuel used for fire,
and still a very common

one, is wood. Wood grows
constantly, so that ideally

it should last as long as
Earth does in approxi
mately its present form
However, it is possible to
1se wood faster than it re-

places itself and, in fact

 

 

this becomes inevitable as
population grows and the
uses tor lire increase

from an old wortc

 
mains of very ancient
wood. When coal was
found, it was burned. When
quantities were found
partly buried, the ground
was sometimes dug into to
find additional quantities.
There are records of coal
having been burned in
China about 1000 B.C., in
ancient Greece, among pre-

1241

Columbian Native Ameri-
cans, and so on.

For a long time, thes
were merely opportunistic
operations, but surface coal
was getting hard to find,
and people started digging
in earnest—first in China.

In England, coal-min-
ing became a serious opera-
tion in the early thirteenth

 

century, and by 1228 Lon-
don was receiving ship-
ments of coal by sea from
Newecastle. (Londoners
called it sea-coal, for that
reason.)

Coal continued to be
burned as a substitute for
wood, all the more so as En-
gland was gradually being
deforested.

 

Rudders

To steer ships, it was cus-
tomary for someone to hold
a broad oar out back of the
ship and by turning it this
way and that cause the ship
to curve in its path as de-
sired. Eventually it oc-

curred to someone to make
the steering mechanism
part of the ship itself and to
control it from within the
ship. This is a rudder, from
an old word related to the
verb to row.

The Arabs had it first,
and it may have been an-

other item brought back by
the Crusaders. Ships of the
Hanseatic League (a trad-
ing combine of north Euro-
pean seaports that was
increasingly important at
this time) were using it
about 1241.

Planetary Tables

Nothing better than Ptol-
emy's tables of planetary
motion (see 140) had been
prepared in eleven centu-
ries. Now a new set was
prepared under the
sponsorship of Alfonso X of
Castile, who reigned from
1252 to 1284. He was very
interested in astronomy

and was no fool at it and
was called Alfonso the Wise
in consequence. He is fa-
mous for a remark he made
in reference to the calcula-
tions necessary to the prep-
aration of the tables: “If
God had asked my advice, I
would have suggested a
simpler design for the Uni-
verse.”

He was right. The

Universe is certainly enor-
mously more complex than
Ptolemy thought it was, but
with respect to the informa-
tion necessary for prepar-
ing planetary tables, it was
simpler in design than Ptol-
emy had thought. Neverthe-
less, the Alfonsine tables
were an improvement on
what had gone before.

 

1269

 

Magnetic Poles

In 1269 a French scholar,
Pelerin de Maricourt (13th
century), also known by his
Latin name of Petrus Pere-
grinus de Maricourt, was
taking part in the slow and
dull siege of an Italian city.
To pass the time, he wrote
a letter to a friend describ-
ing his researches on mag-

nets. He described the
existence of magnetic poles,
regions on a magnet where
the magnetic force was
most intense, and showed
how to determine the north
and south poles of a mag-
net, since like poles re-
pelled each other and
unlike poles attracted each
other. He also explained
that one could not isolate a

pole, for if a magnet were
broken into smaller pieces,
each piece would have both
a north and south pole.
This is about the first
piece of good scientific ex-
perimentation in the mod-
ern sense, although it
would be more than three
centuries before experimen-
tal science was well estab-

lished.
 

In the same letter, Pere-
grinus explained that a
compass would work better
if the magnetic sliver or
needle were put on a pivot

 

rather than allowed to float
on a piece of cork, and that
a graduated circular scale
should be placed under it

to allow directions to be

 

read more accurately. T

Mirrors

Until now, glass had almost
always been colored (see
100 B.c.). It was in Venice
that the technique for add-
ing decolorizing material to
glass was developed and
where glass was first
formed that was reasonably
clear and transparer
Though uncolored glass
might seem boring, it
turned out not to be so.
Clear glass struck people as
beautiful, and to have cups
and other objects made of
it proved very desirable

In 1291 Venice re-

 

   

moved its glass-manufac-
turing establishment to a
guarded island and set up
stiff penalties for anyone re-
vealing any manufacturing
secrets. It did its best to
maintain a strict monopoly
of the valuable mater
and Venetian glass contin-
ued to be considered the
height of luxury.

One thing that cleat
glass made possible was
the modern mirror. In an-
cient times, people could
see themselves in still
water or in the polished sur

al,

 

 

face of a metal such as
bronze. Water rarely re-

mained still for long, how-
ever, and polished met

 

was expensive. The result
was that very few pec
knew what they locke
or could do something as

  

iple as arrange their

own hair

S1

 

A sheet of clear glass
however, could be backed
with a film of metal, and

the result was a luminously

 

clear mirror in which it
was possible to study one’s

own face to one’s heart's

 

content. (It is not for n
ing that a mirror is alsc

called a looking-glass.)

The Far East

The existence of the Mongol
Empire made it easier for
travelers to make their way
from Europe to China than
ever before. In 1260 two
brothers, Nicolo and Maf-
feo Polo, well-to-do Vene-
tian merchants, made their
first trading trip eastward.
In 1275 they returned to
northern China, where
Kublai Khan maintained
his capital, and this time
they brought Nicolo’s son,
Marco Polo (1254-1324).
Marco stayed in China for
twenty years, was in high
favor most of the time, and
had an opportunity to
study the land, the people,
and the customs. He found
a nation far in advance of
Europe in population, in
wealth, in technology,

and in all the civilized
amenities.

He didn’t return to Ven-
ice till 1295. Then, caught
up in a war between Venice
and Genoa, he was taken
prisoner and, while in

o o

prison, began to dictate his
reminiscences of China.
The book was published in
1298 and was immensely
popular, but it was largely
disbelieved.

It did create an impres-

sion of the “gorgeous East,”

however, so that the Far
East became a wonder-goal
for European dreamers,
with important conse-
quences for the future.

Spinning
Wheels

For thousands of years, fi-
bers had been spun into
thread by the action of the
hand: the fiber was held on
a distaff and was twisted
into yarn by turning a spin-
dle. It was a slow, painstak-
ing process that thoroughly
occupied much of the time
of the females of a house-
hold. (It was “women’s
work" par excellence, and
the females of a family are
still referred to jocularly as
“the distaff side.”)

In India the process
had eventually been mecha-
nized: a foot-powered trea-
dle turned a large wheel
that twisted the spindle.
Such a spinning wheel
greatly hastened the work
of spinning thread out of
fiber. About 1298 the spin-
ning wheel made its way
into Europe.

The wheel and the spin-
dle were connected by a
belt, the first example of a
belt drive in machinery. The
spinning wheel was also
one of the first important
mechanical means of light-
ening women's work.

Longbows

The longbow was invented
in the thirteenth century by
the Welsh. It was more
than 6 feet long and fired
arrows that were 3 feet
long. A skilled longbow ar-
cher could shoot an arrow
accurately for 250 yards
and reach an extreme range
of 350 yards. This was
twice the range of the aver-

 
age crossbow (see 1050),
and much more important,
while the crossbow was
being cranked up once, the
longbow could be fired five
or six times. If equal num-
bers of archers with long-
bows and crossbows were

1300

 

to encounter each other,
the crossbow archers would
be riddled.

The disadvantage of
the longbow, however, was
that the archer had to exert
a force of 90 to 100 pounds
to draw the bow and to

maintain that pull evenly
until the feather of the
arrow was aligned with the

Edward I of England

 

(see ) 1) recognized the
value of the weapon and set
about training a corps of

English longbow archers

 

He put the longbow to the
test against the Scots at the
Battle of Falkirk on July 22,
1298,

The English went on to

bows in other

   

use the long
battles, and no other nation
ever adopted this obvious
weapon. As a result, the En-
glish were a great military
power for the next century

and a half

 

Sulfuric Acid

The greatest of all the al-
chemical discoveries was
made by someone whose

name is not known. This al
chemist wrote about 1300
using the name of Geber in
order to gain credence by
association with that gre

 

Arabian alchemist (set
750)

The result is that we
know notl

chemist

 
referred to as the False
Geber. This is a pity, for the
False Geber was the first to
describe sulfuric acid, the
most important single in-
dustrial chemical used
today (barring such
“always-known" sub-
stances as air, water, and
salt).

Sulfuric acid is much
stronger than acetic acid
and made possible many
chemical changes that
would not have been possi-
ble before.

Distilled Liquor

Natural fermentation has
its limits. As fruit or other
materials ferment, alcohol
accumulates and eventu-

1304

ally grows sufficiently con-
centrated to kill the yeasts
or other microorganisms
that were producing the fer-
mentation.

The alchemists had
learned how to distill: how
to heat a substance and
drive off the volatile materi-
als, which could condense
into liquid elsewhere, leav-
ing behind dissolved mat-
ter, Thus, if sea water 1s
heated, the vapors consist
only of water, and if cooled,
this is drinkable. The salt is
left behind and has its own
uses.

Eventually, alcoholic
beverages were distilled.
Since alcohol boils at a
lower temperature than
water does, the initial va-

pors of the beverage are
higher in alcohol than the
original liquid. If the va-
pors are then cooled and
condensed, the result is a
stronger liquor with a good
deal more of a “kick” than
the original has.

In 1300 the Spanish al-
chemist Arnau de Villanova
(ca. 1235-1312) distilled
wine and obtained reason-
ably pure alcohol for the
first time. In the process, of
course, he prepared
brandy, which is distilled
wine with a much higher al-
cohol content than ordi-
nary wine. Not only
brandy, but whiskey (made
by distilling fermenting
grain) became available in
sizable quantities.

 

Giotto’s Comet

A bright comet was visible
in Europe’s sky in 1301. It

 

created the usual panicky
stir, but the Italian artist
Giotto di Bondone (ca.
1267-1337), usually
known by his first name,

observed it with an artist's
eye.

Till then, and for a con-
siderable time afterward,
those who drew comets let
their panic be their guide
and presented the silliest
pictures imaginable. In
1304, however, Giotto

painted The Adoration of
the Magi, in which he pic-
tured the star of Bethlehem
as a comet, and seems to
have let the comet of 1301
guide his brush. Giotto’s is
the first realistic depiction
of a comet.

Canary Islands

The Canary Islands are off
the shore of Morocco,

which is in northwestern
Africa. The King of Maurita-
nia (located where Morocco
is now) had sent an expedi-
tion there in 40 B.c. and

1316

found them already inhab-
ited. In 999 Arabs l:

The early visits to the
Canary Islands did not re-

sciousness. However, in
1312, a Genoese vessel
reached the Canary Islands,

and though they didn’t stay
either, this visit was known
to Europe and remem-
bered. It was the first small
and abortive step toward
European expansion over-

seas

 

 

Dissection

The stirrings of humanism
allowed scholars to grow
more interested in science.
In the medical schools of
Italy, it even became possi-
ble to dissect cadavers once
again. The greatest of the

new group of anatomists
was the Italian Mondino de
Luzzi (ca. 1275-1326), who
taught at the medical
school of Bologna

In 1316 he published
the first book in history to

Mechanical
Clocks

The first advance over the
water clock (see 270 B.c.)
came in the fourteenth cen-
tury. Instead of being
driven by a rise in water
level, the dial on the clock
face was driven by the

downward pull of gravity
on weights.

The resulting mechani-
cal clocks did not tell time
more accurately than water
clocks did, but they were
more convenient and re-
quired less care. They could
be mounted in a tower
(either of the city hall or of
the town church) for all to

see. One was erected in
Milan, Italy, in 1335, for in-
stance. It struck the hour,
and for the first time citi-
zens could learn the time
(to the nearest hour, at any
rate) by listening to the
number of times the bell
rang. (The very word clock
is from the French word for
“bell.”)

Quarantine

Despite the fact that noth-

disease came to be (except
for the usual theories of
punishment by God or in-
festation by demons), peo-
ple did tend to avoid those
who were sick with some
particularly fatal or loath-
some disease.

Thus, leprosy (undoubt-
edly along with less drastic
skin diseases) was treated
as something that required
isolation. Lepers were
driven out of society.

When the Black Death

struck, people instinctively
fled from those affected
(sometimes leaving the
dying to die and the dead
to remain unburied).

In 1403 the city of Ven-
ice, always rationally ruled,
decided that recurrences of
the Black Death could best
be averted by not allowing
strangers to enter the city
until a certain waiting pe-
riod had passed. If by then
they had not developed the
disease and died, they
could be considered not to
have it and would be al-
lowed to enter.

The waiting time was

eventually standardized at
forty days (perhaps because
forty-day periods play an
important role in the
Bible). For that reason, the
waiting period was called
quarantine, from the French
word for “forty.”

In a society that knew
no other way of fighting dis-
ease, quarantine was better
than nothing. It was the
first measure of public hy-
giene deliberately taken to
fight disease.

Indian Ocean

For a brief period under the
Emperor Yung-lo of China
(who reigned from 1402 to
1424), it seemed as though
China might become a sea
power. A Muslim eunuch,
Cheng Ho (ca. 1371- ca.
1433), led a series of expedi-
tions southward and west-
ward through the Indian
Ocean. His first expedition
sailed forth in 1405, with
twenty-seven thousand
men and three hundred
ships, and forced the poten-

1418

tates of the Indonesian is-
lands to accept Chinese
overlordship (at least until
the ships left).

In a second voyage in
1409, Cheng Ho visited
India and Ceylon. When the
Ceylonese attacked the
ships, he defeated them and
brought the ruler of Ceylon
a prisoner to China. In later
voyages (there were seven
in all), he went still farther
west, reaching the Red Sea
and visiting Mecca and
Egypt.

After Emperor Yung-

lo’s death, however, suc-
ceeding emperors decided
that China had no need to
venture far afield in order
to visit and deal with the in-
ferior barbarians. China
was a world in itself and it
was enough for the Chinese.

And so, in effect, China
abdicated its chance at
world influence and left it
to other much smaller,
much weaker, and much
less advanced nations.

 

Madeira

Little Portugal, at the oppo-
site end of the vast Eur-
asian continent, had an
attitude quite different
from that of China. China
was aware of its immense
self-sufficiency; Portugal
was aware of its own insuf-
ficiencies. China needed
nothing from abroad; Por-
tugal wanted silk, spices,
and all sorts of other
things. What's more, Portu-
gal was at the very end of
the line, farthest from the
source, so that it received

least and paid most. And
now that the Mongols were
gone and the hostile Otto-
man Turks were in control
of the Middle East (despite
the fierce temporary shock
of Tamerlane’s career),
trade between China and
western Europe had dwin-
dled further.

This was the situation
that faced Prince Henry of
Portugal (1394—1460). It oc-
curred to him that there
was no use in trying to
trade with the gorgeous
East that Marco Polo had
so fetchingly described—at

least not by land. Why not
instead bypass the Turks al-
together and sail around Af-
rica to get there?

The trouble was that
no one knew how far south
Africa extended, whether
the voyage was practical,
the seas navigable, the
Tropic Zone passable, and
so on. (No one paid any at-
tention to Herodotus's wild
tale of the Phocnicians hav-
ing circumnavigated Africa
two thousand vears before.)

Prince Henry therefore
established an observatory
and school for navigation
at Sagres on Cape St. Vin-
cent in 1418. This was in
southernmost Portugal, the
southwestern tip of Europe
Year after year, he outfitted
and sent out ships that
inched their way farther
and farther down the Afri-
can coast. With Prince
Henry, now universally
known as Henry the Navi-
gator, the great European
Age of Exploration began,
and the role that China was

giving up at just about this
time, Portugal (and later
other European powers)
were accepting.

The result was that Chi-
nese vessels never came to
Portugal, but Portuguese
vessels (and those of other
European powers) eventu-
ally came to China, and
China was to pay dearly
for its period of self-satis-
faction

The first fruit of Prince

Henry's efforts came in
1418, when Portuguese nav-
igators discovered Madeira.
It was a heavily wooded is-
land (the name is from the
Portuguese word for
“wood”) and was uninhab-
ited. Prince Henry ordered
the island settled. The
woods were burned down
and the land was given over
to cultivation, that of sugar-
cane in particular.

 

1427

 

Azores

The Azores are a group of is-
lands in the Atlantic, of
which the easternmost is
about 750 miles west of
Portugal. They were dis-

covered in 1427 by the
Portuguese navigator Diogo
de Sevilha. Like Madeira,
they were uninhabited, and
like Madeira, they are still
part of Portugal. Since they
are one-third of the way

across the Atlantic in the di-
rection of the American con-
tinents, it is clear that
already, thanks to the com-
pass, the Portuguese were
ranging far.

Perspective

The Renaissance was a
great age of realism in art,
and the Italian painters
wanled their canvases to
appear to have three dimen-
sions. In order to do that

 

1439

they had to have proper per-
spective: lines had to come
together as they seem to do
in real life. The Italian art-
ist Leon Battista Alberti
(1404-1472) published a
book in 1436 in which he de-
scribed the proper method

of achieving perspective,
handling the matter in a
careful mathematical man-
ner. This proved to be a
[orerunner of projective ge

ometry, which was devel

 

oped four centuries later

Charles VII, now truly king,
bestirred himself to reform
his army, hiring two broth-
ers, Jean and Gaspard Bu-
reau, to reorganize the

Nevertheless, the har-

so that it could be fired

ued to be used for a century
before it was superseded.

Concave Lenses

Until now, only convex
lenses had been used in eye-
glasses (see 1249). Convex
lenses are thicker in the cen-
ter than at the edges, and
they curve the light inward
so that on passing through
the lens of the eye it

reaches a focus sooner than

it otherwise would. This is

useful for eyves that are too

 

short and are ordinarily
far-sighted (usually among
the aged).

In 1451, however, the
German scholar Nicholas of
Cusa (1401-1464) sug
gested the use of concave
lenses, thinner in the center
than at the edges, to bend

light outward and bring it

The Renaissance and the Scientific
Revolution (1454—1700)

The Renaissance happened
for a variety of reasons, but
in terms of renewed inter-
est in science nothing can
compare in impact with the
printing press, invented by
Johannes Gutenberg in
1454, Ancient works, long
unavailable in the West,
came bz

 

< into circulation

other major stimulu
quiry was the Age of Explo
ration that had begun ir

the carly 1400s. App

 

there was a great deal more
to the world than the an
cients had known. While
the Renaissance was

an

 
 

 

gious authority, many sci-
entists and philosophers
were no longer content
with Aristotle’s world view
and other elements of an-
cient scientific thinking
that the Catholic Church
had come to embrace. This
was the case with astron-
omy and Nicolaus Coperni-
cus, whose book Concerning
the Revolution of the Heav-
enly Bodies (1543) started
the Scientific Revolution.
With a Sun-centered sys-
tem the observed motions
of the planets now made
sense, although the Church
still held that the Earth
was the center of the uni-
verse. The revolution in as-
tronomy continued. In 1572
Tycho Brahe's report of a
new star in the northern
sky brought into doubt the
ancient idea that the heav-
ens were unchanging. In
1609 Johannes Kepler’s
claim that the planets
moved in ellipses added fur-

1454

ther insult to the ancient
theories, in which the circle
was the perfect form. In
1609 Galileo Galilei made a
telescope, looked at the
Milky Way, and declared
for the first time that it was
made up of countless faint
stars. He was also inter-
ested in Earth-based phe-
nomena and in 1589
established that the pull of
gravity causes an object to
move with constantly in-
creasing speed. This sugges-
tion that gravity, not divine
power, caused the move-
ment of the Universe was
another challenge to tradi-
tion. The work of Isaac
Newton in optics, mathe-
matics, and physics was the
culmination of the Scien-
tific Revolution. His earli-
est investigations, into the
properties of light, led to
his invention of an im-
proved telescope. While
pursuing the problem of
gravity, he devised calcu-

lus, the basis of higher
mathematics. Newton's
analysis of the mechanical
forces that control the uni-
verse justified the findings
of Copernicus, Tycho,
Kepler, and Galileo. Just as
many fields of study were
opened during this period,
so several fundamentals of
the discipline of science
were established. The “first
publication” rule came to
be accepted; it states that
credit goes not to the first
person who makes a discov-
ery but to the one who first
publishes it. Galileo is gen-
erally given credit for set-
ting the parameters of
experimental science with
his work on falling bodies
and acceleration. Francis
Bacon formalized the philo-
sophical framework for the
scientific method: that sci-
entific findings must be
based on large amounts of
specific observation.

 

Printing

There is no way to overesti-
mate the importance of
writing (see 3500 B.c.). Nev-
ertheless, it can’t be denied
that writing is a tedious
process, and there have al-
ways been efforts to hasten
it. The Egyptians worked
out faster ways of scrawl-

ing their complicated sym-
bols, and the Romans
worked out systems of
shorthand.

The ancient Sumeri-
ans, however, developed lit-
tle cylinders of hard stone
with designs incised into
them that could be rolled
onto soft clay so that the de-
signs were impressed, and

these could be made perma-
nent by baking. The cylin-
ders could be used over and
over again and served as a
signature for the owner.
Why could not the
same system be used for
pressing symbols onto a
sheet of paper? If a block
with a raised reversed sym-
bol on it is smeared with
ink, it can press an inked
symbol (nonreversed) onto
paper. The Chinese started
doing this about the year
350, and by 800 they were
carving entire pages on
wooden blocks. Such a
page could then be printed
any number of times, all
the impressions being ex-
actly alike. But then, it took
a long time to carve the
wooden block into a bas-
relief with all the symbols
perfectly formed.

Later the Chinese got
the idea of using a different
block for each symbol, so
that the blocks could be ar-
ranged into any desired
combination to give any de-
sired page. By 1450 they
had movable wooden char-

acters of this type, and by
1500 they were making use
of metal characters.

By then, though, the
Europeans had outstripped
them (though it is possible
that news concerning mov-
able type had reached Eu-
rope from China and given
the Europeans a head
start).

The German inventor
Johannes Gutenberg (ca.
1390—1468) had been work-
ing out the matter of mov-
able type since 1435. He
had paper to work with (it
had long ago reached Eu-
rope from China) and he ex-
perimented with different
inks. He also designed a
printing press, a device
that would press the paper

down un all those little
metal characters evenly

By 1454 Gutenberg had
worked out all the bugs in
his process and was ready
for the big task: he began to
put out a Bible, in double
columns, with forty-two
Latin lines to the column.
He produced three hundred
copies of each of 1282 pages
and that produced the
three hundred Gutenberg Bi-
bles. It was the first printed
book, and many people con-
sider it the most beautiful
ever produced—so that the
art was born at its height.
The Gutenberg Bibles that
remain today are the most
valued books in the world.

Position of
Comets

Comets had always been
viewed with such terror
that almost no one had
been able to observe them
rationally. Then in 1472,
when a bright comet ap-
peared in the sky, a Ger-

man astronomer, Johann
Miiller (1436—1476), re-
fused to allow himself to be
governed by fear. (He is
better known by his self-
chosen name of Regiomon-
tanus, which means King's
Mountain, as does the Ger-
man name of his birth-
place, Konigsberg.)
Regiomontanus ob-

served the comet from
night to night and noted its
position against the stars.
In this way, for the first
time, the exact path of a
comet across the sky was
plotted. It marked the be-
ginning of rationalism with
respect to those bodies.

 

1487

 

Cape of
Good Hope

In February 1487 the Portu-
guese navigator Bartholo-
meu Diaz (1450-1500) set
forth to search for the
southernmost part of the Af-

rican continent. In a way,
he didn't find it, for a storm
drove him past it into the
open sea.

He turned north again
and reached a portion of
the African coast that was
running eastward. He fol-
lowed it eastward until it

began turning northward.
By that time, his rebellious
crew forced him to turn
back. He retraced his steps,
located the southernmost
point of the continent, and
reported it to King John II
of Portugal (1455-1495) as
the Cape of Storms, for obvi-
 

ous reasons. King John II,
however, realizing that one
more push would now
bring his ships to the Far

1492

East, renamed it the Cape
of Good Hope, the name it
bears to this day

 

 

New World

While the Portuguese were
working their way around
Africa, there were those
who felt that the same re-
sult could be achieved an-
other way. Since it was
understood that the Earth
was spherical, it was bound
to occur to people that it
might be circumnavigated
and that the Far East could
be reached by sailing west.
The concept was a sim
ple one and, in fact, it had
been suggested by Roger
Bacon (see 1249) two centu-
ries before. What stopped

people from making the ef-
fort was the thought that
between the western coast
of Europe and the eastern
coast of Asia might be a
vast stretch of ocean that
the ships of the day could
not be expected to manag
If Eratosthenes was
correct and the Earth was
25,000 miles in circumfer:
ence (see 240 B.c.), then be
tween Europe and Asia
were some 12,000 miles of
unbroken sea. Yet other au
thorities, such as Ptole
(see 140), had thought the
Earth was smaller than
that, and Marco Polo had

 

 

1y

 

thought that Asia extended
farther east than it really
did

Combining a smaller
Earth with a more east-
ward Asia, an Italian navi
gator, Christopher
Columbus (14511506
was convinced that a west
ward trip from Europe to
Asia was a matter of only
3,000 miles. He the

this could be managed, and

 

he shopped about the var
ous nations of western Eu

rope tor hinancial

 

so that he could outlit an ex
pedition.

Portugal was a natural
target, of course, but the
Portuguese experts thought
the Earth was larger than
Columbus’s figure (the Por-
tuguese were right) and
were convineed it would
not be long before they cir-
cumnavigated Africa and
reached their goal.

Columbus tried else-
where without luck and
was almost on the point of
giving up when things
turned out well for him in
Spain.

With Ferdinand and Is-
abella ruling jointly over a
united Spain, the nation
could assault the last scrap
of Muslim rule. This was
the nation of Granada in
the far south of Spain. The
joint monarchs prosecuted
a vigorous war against Gra-
nada and on January 2,
1492, it fell. What's more,
Torquemada engineered
the expulsion of the Jews
from Spain in 1492. (This
was not a new phenome-
non, for the Jews had ear-
lier been expelled from
England and France. They
found a refuge in Poland,
which needed a merchant
class, and in the Muslim
world, which was more tol-
erant than the Christians,
because for one thing, they
were at the time more civi-
lized.)

The Spanish monarchs,
feeling Spain to be united
and strong, decided to give
Columbus a minimum of

financial backing. With
three old ships and a crew
of prisoners released from
jail for the purpose, he set
forth on August 3, 1492. For
seven weeks he sailed west-
ward, encountering no land
but also encountering no
storms. Finally on October
12, he sighted land—an is-
land, as it turned out, in
the Bahamas.

He sailed southward
and encountered islands of
the West Indies. (To his
dying day, Columbus was
convinced he had reached
the Indies; that is, the east-
ern coast of Asia. The name
of the West Indies and the
habit of calling Native
Americans Indians are the
result of that delusion.)

It was not Asia, of
course, that he had come
upon, but the American
continents, a New World,
and the Old World would
never be the same again.

Columbus was not, of
course, the first human
being to set foot on these
continents. Siberian na-
tives had done so at least
thirty thousand years ear-
lier (see 20,000 B.c.). He was
not even the first European
to do so, for Leif Eriksson
had done it five centuries
before (see 1000). Colum-
bus’s feat, however, led al-
most at once to the
beginning of permanent Eu-
ropean settlements on the
new continents, and that

marked their entry into the
common current of world
history. It is for this reason
that Columbus is generally
given credit for the “discov-
ery.”

Incidentally, the fact
that new continents existed
that were wholly unknown
to the ancients helped elim-
inate the notion that the an-
cient thinkers had known
everything and had solved
all problems. Europeans
gained the heady feeling
that they now moved be-
yond the ancients, and that
helped make possible the
Scientific Revolution that
was to start in half a cen-
tury.

Magnetic
Declination

The magnetic compass,
which made a voyage like
Columbus’s possible, natu-
rally focused considerable
attention on the phenome-
non of magnetism. No one
knew at this time why the
needle pointed north, but
people took it for granted
that whatever the reason,
the needle pointed north
steadily and without
change.

The person who found
out differently was Colum-
bus himself. As he sailed
westward, he couldn’t help
but notice that the mag-
netic needle changed some-
 

what in direction. When he
started, the compass needle
pointed a bit west of true
north as determined by the
stars. As he traveled west-
ward, the magnetic needle
veered eastward, pointed to
true north at a certain
point, and finally pointed a
bit east of north.

Columbus, being scien-
tifically minded, noted this
in his journal, but he kept it
a secret [rom his crew. Had
they known that the com-

pass wasn't to be relied on

they would surely have pan-
icked, killed Columbus, and
headed back east in a des-

perate effort to regain land

 

belore they were | 1o

ably not have made it, and

had the mission not re
turned, it would have be

ropean monarch risked
money on a second suckh

venture

Syphilis

In 1495 there was an out-
break of a new disease in
the Italian city of Naples,
which was under siege by a
French army. This disease
spread quickly, carried by
soldiers from place to
place. Nearly half a century
later, an Italian astrono-
mer, Girolamo Fracastoro
(ca. 1478—1553), wrote a
poem about a shepherd
who caught this new dis-
ease, which the Italians
called the French disease

India

On July 8, 1497, the Portu-
guese navigator Vasco da
Gama (1460-1524) set sail
from Lisbon with four ves-
sels. He rounded the Cape
of Good Hope on November
22, passed the farthest
point reached by Diaz (see
1487), sailed up the eastern
coast of Africa, and finally

reached Calicut, India, on
May 20, 1498.

The deed was done.
What Prince Henry the Nav-
igator had begun (see 1418)
was complete, nearly four
decades after his death. The
Portuguese had bypassed
the Ottoman Empire and
the Italian trading cities,
such as Venice. From this
point on, the Mediterra-

nean region declined in
power and wealth, and the
Atlantic powers took the
lead.

Da Gama’s trip was the
first one long enough to in-
duce scurvy in his men. It
was a debilitating disease
that eventually killed those
who suffered from it. Da
Gama lost three-fifths of his
crew to it.

Americus Vespuci Begin

America.

Watches

A mechanical clock had to
remain vertical if it was
powered by weights being
pulled downward by grav-
ity, Nor could it be small,
for the weights could not be
reduced in size very much
without ceasing to work.
An alternative to weights
came into being, however,
when the mainspring was
invented about 1470. This

1513

was a spiral spring that
could be wound tightly, so
that its tendency to unwind
would then power the
clock.

A German locksmith,
Peter Henlein, realized that
a mainspring would work
just as well when it was
small as when it was large,
and since it didn’t depend
on gravity, it could work in
any position. About 1504,
therefore, he placed a small

mainspring in a clock small
enough to be carried about
in a pocket.

Such a small clock was
called a watch, because sail-
ors or others who had to
maintain a watch at sea or
elsewhere for a fixed period
of time would find it useful.
The original watches had
hour hands only and were
not particularly accurate,
but better things were to
come.

 

South Sea

Columbus had reached the
coast of what we now call
the Isthmus of Panama in
his final voyage, and Span-
ish settlers arrived soon
after. One of the leading set-
tlers was Vasco Nufiez de
Balboa (1475-1519).

At that time, those
Spaniards who thought
they were in Asia kept look-
ing for the vast wealth that
Marco Polo had talked
about, and gold was a par-
ticularly concentrated form
of wealth, one they particu-
larly lusted for. After all,
since the people who lived
in these continents

(whether Asians or not)
were not Christian, any
gold they possessed would
rightly belong to any Chris-
tians who cared to help
themselves to it.

Balboa heard rumors
of gold to the west and he
organized an expedition to
find it. Panama, however, is
a narrow isthmus and you
can't wander far in it with-
out striking the other coast.
Balboa's expedition left on
September 1, 1513, and on
September 25, he climbed a
hill and found himself star-
ing at the limitless expanse
of what seemed to be an
ocean. Since the coasts of
Panama run east-west and

the Atlantic Ocean is on the
north shore, Balboa named
the new ocean on the south
shore the South Sea.

Balboa probably did
not realize that this was the
second ocean Vespucius
had referred to, the one
that lay between the Ameri-
can continents and Asia—
but it was.

Florida

Puerto Rico (rich port) had
been discovered in 1492 in
the course of Columbus’s
first voyage, and he had left
some men behind when he
returned to Spain. When he
reached Puerto Rico on his
second voyage, the settlers
were gone, but others soon
followed. By 1513 the Span-
iards were well established
in Puerto Rico, and one of
the settlers was Juan Ponce
de Leon (1460-1521).

Ponce de Leon dealtin
slaves and on March 3,
1513, he sailed northwest-
ward in search of more He
reached the North Ameri-
can continent during the
Easter season and called
the land Florida (flowery)
because of its appearance.
It became the first portion
of what is now the United
States to be settled by Euro-
peans.
 

 

1519

 

Mexico

After a quarter-century of
sailing about the Carib-
bean, Spanish explorers
had still not encountered
the civilizations that ex-
isted in the American conti-
nents. In 1517, Francisco
Fernandez de Cérdoba
(14752-1525 or 1526), had
sailed westward from Cuba
and discovered the penin-
sula of Yucatan. There he
was the first to encounter
traces of the Mayan civiliza-
tion, but that was a civiliza-
tion in ruins.

Westward, however,
across the Gulf of Mexico,
lay the still flourishing

1523

Aztec Empire, which con-
trolled all of central and
southern Mexico and had a
population of about 5 mil-
lion.

In 1519 some six hun-
dred Spaniards under Her-
nan Cortés (1485—1547)
landed with seventeen
horses and ten cannon.
That this small force suf-
ficed to destroy the Aztec
Empire is not as surprising
as it may sound and does
not imply that Europeans
were innately superior to
the Aztecs. For one thing,
the Aztecs had nothing to
counter either the horses or
the cannon. For another,
the subject peoples of the

Aztecs were restive and
ready to fight on the side of
Cortés. Finally, the Aztecs
and their king, Montezuma
II (1466—1520), had the su-
perstitious feeling that the
Spaniards were gods whose
coming had been predicted,
and they did not resist
strongly until it was too
late.

So the Aztec Empire
was destroyed and Mexico
was taken over by Spain.
No effort was made to save
the Aztec culture or retain
information concerning it.
It was, after all, non-Chris-
tian.

 

Circumnavi-
gation of the
Earth

Ferdinand Magellan (ca.
1480-1521) is the English
name of a Portuguese navi-
gator, financed by Spain,
who sailed west with five
ships on September 20,
1519, in search of the Far
East. When he reached the
eastern bulge of South

America, he began looking
for a southern end to that
continent, which he found
on October 21. For over five
weeks, he felt his way
through what is now
known as the Strait of Ma-
gellan, amid storms, and on
November 28, it opened
into an ocean and the
storms ceased. As Magellan
sailed on and on through
good weather, he called
this new ocean the Pacific.

However, the Pacific
Ocean was far larger than
anyone would have ex-
pected, and was sadly free
of land. For ninety-nine
days, the ships sailed
through unbroken sea, and
the men underwent tor-
tures of hunger and thirst.
Finally they reached the is-
land of Guam, then they
sailed westward to the Phil-
ippine Islands. There, on
April 17, 1521, Magellan
died in a skirmish with the
inhabitants.

The expedition contin-
ued westward, however,
and a single ship with eigh
teen men aboard, under the
leadership of Juan Sebas-
tian de Elcano (ca. 1476
1526), finally arrived back

in Spain on September 7,

1531

1522. This first circumnavi

Peru

There remained the Inca
Empire, a realm stretching
along the Andes mountain
range, with its center in
what is now Peru and with
a population of about 7 mil-
lion, It was ruled by Atahu-
alpa (ca. 1502-1533), who
had become head of the em-
pire in 1530

In 1531 Francisco Pi-
zarro (ca. 1475-1541)
sailed to Peru with 180
men, twenty-seven cannon
and two horses. In the
course of the next threc

Cubic Equations

At this time, mathemati-
cians found it easy to solve
equations of the first degree
(linear equations, involving
x) and of the second degree
(quadratic equations, involv-
ing x?). Equations of the
third degree (cubic equa-
tions, involving x*) defeated
them.

In 1535, however, the
Italian mathematician Nic-
colo Tartaglia (1499-1557)
found a general method for
solving cubic equations. In
those days, mathematicians
would often keep their dis-
coveries secret and parade
their ability to solve prob-
lems others could not. This

raised their reputations
and gave them a feeling of
power. However, another
Italian mathematician, Ge-
ronimo Cardano (1501—
1576), wheedled the cubic
equation solution out of
Tartaglia and then pub-
lished it, so that Cardano is
often given credit for the
discovery.

Tartaglia objected
loudly, but the event set an
important precedent. Scien-
tific discoveries do not be-
long to the discoverer but
to the world. If discoverers
all clutched their discover-
ies close to their chests in
order to garner personal
glory, the progress of sci-
ence would creak to a halt.

It has therefore become a
rule that credit for a discov-
ery goes not necessarily to
the original discoverer, but
to the first who publishes
the discovery.

This encourages publi-
cation and allows all scien-
tists to learn of discoveries
as soon as possible. Science
as we know it would not
exist without the “first pub-
lication’' rule, and Car-
dano, by his dishonorable
action, pushed science in
that direction, thus doing
he world more good than
he did Tartaglia harm.
1538

 

Comets’ Tails

in the 1530s, no fewer than
six comets appeared in the
sky. Fired by the example
of Regiomontanus (sec¢
1472), astronomers viewed
them calmly. One of these
was Girolamo Fracastoro,
who had coined the word

syphilis (see 1495). In 1538
he published a book in

which he recorded his ob-
servations and mentioned
that a comet’s tail always

puinted away from the Sun.

A German astronomer,
Peter Bennewitz (in Latin
Petrus Apianus; 1501 -
1552), also studying these

comets, published a book in
1540 in which he came to
the same conclusion inde-
pendently. He published
the first scientilic drawing
of a comet, in which he indi-
cated the position of the

tail with reference 1o the
Sun.

Mississippi
River

The interior of the Ameri-
can continents was being
increasingly explored. Cor-
tés explored what is now
northern Mexico and in
1536 discovered the penin-
sula of Baja California.

In 1539 the Spanish ex-
plorer Hernando de Soto
(ca. 1500-1542) was com-
missioned by Charles V to
land in Florida and add it
to the Spanish dominions.
De Soto did more than
that. Over the space of
three years, he explored
what is now the southeast-
ern portion of the United

States. In 1541 he and his
men were the first Europe-
ans to see the Mississippi
River. He crossed it but re-
turned to it in the spring of
1542 and died on its banks,

 

1542

 

Amazon River

One of Pizarro’s aides dur-
ing his conquest of Peru
was Francisco de Orellana
(ca. 1490—ca. 1546), who
was exploring eastward
past the Andes Mountains
when he came upon the
headwaters of a river. He
felt it would be easier to see
where the river led him

than to make his way back
across the formidable
mountain barrier.

From April 1541 to Au-
gust 1542, he progressed
down the river, which as it
happened, was by far the
greatest in the world in
terms of water volume de-
livered to the ocean and
area drained. His report
mentioned tribes that ap-

peared to be led by women.
This reminded people of
the Amazons, the women
warriors of Greek legend,
and the river was named
the Amazon in conse-
quence.

Orellana was the first
European to cross South
America from ocean to
ocean.

 
1543

 

Heliocentric
System

The speculations of Aris-
tarchus (see 280 B.c.), about
a heliocentric system in
which the Sun was at the
center of the Universe, with
the planets, including the
Earth, revolving about it,
had been disregarded, and
the geocentric system of
Hipparchus (see 150 B.c.)
and Ptolemy (see 140) had
been accepted without
question.

However, the mathe-
matics needed to work out
the planetary motions on a
geocentric basis was very
difficult. While the Sun and
Moon moved steadily west-
to-east against the stars,
the other planets occasion-
ally reversed direction (ret-
rograde motion) and grew
markedly brighter and dim-
mer as they progressed
across the sky.

The Polish astronomer
Nicolaus Copernicus (1473—
1543) thought, as early as
1507, that if one went back
to Aristarchus’s view and
supposed that all the plan-
ets, including Earth, were
moving about the Sun, it
would become easy to ex-
plain retrograde motion. [t
would also be easy to ex-

plain why Venus and Mer-
cury always remained near
the Sun and why planets
grew dimmer and brighter.
In addition to all this, the
mathematics for working
out planetary motions and
positions would be simpli-
fied.

Copernicus did not, in
his suggestions, abandon
all Greek ideas. He clung to
the notion that planets had
to move in orbits that were
circles and combinations of
circles, and in this way he
retained much unnecessary
complexity.

The difference between
Aristarchus and Copernicus
was that Aristarchus
merely presented his notion
as a logical way of looking
at the planets. Since others
thought it wasn't logical,
that ended it. Copernicus,
however, used the Aris-
tarchean idea to work out
the actual mathematics of
the planetary motions and
show the reduction in com-
plexity. This meant that
even if people denied that
the heliocentric system
could be true, they would
still be apt to use it as a sim-
plified device for calcula-
tions,

Nevertheless, Coperni-
cus hesitated to publish his
theory and his computa-

tions, because he knew that
the geocentric theory was
felt by the Church to be in
accordance with the Bible.
To advance a heliocentric
theory that would seem to
be going against the Bible
would surely create a
storm. He therefore quietly
circulated his book only in
manuscript form.

Finally he let himself
be persuaded by enthusias-
tic friends to have the book
printed. It was entitled De
Revolutionibus Orbitm
Coelestium (Concerning the
Revolution of Heavenly Bod-
tes). He dedicated it to Pope
Paul II1 (1468—1549) as a
placatory gesture, and then
died. The story is that Co-
pernicus was given the very
first copy ol his book on the
day of his death.

As Copernicus had for-
seen, the book created a
loud and violent storm. The
Catholic Church put the
book on its Index, forbid-
ding the faithful 1o read it,
and did not lift the ban till
1835. The Lutherans were
equally hostile. The book
could not be suppressed,
however. With the coming
of printing, far too many
copies (looded the libraries
of the scholars.

Copernicus's book to-
tally overturned Greek as-
tronomy, and though it was
fifty years before astrono-
mers generally could bear
to turn their backs on Ptol-
emy and accept the fact
that the vast Earth flew
through space on an annual
journey about the Sun, the
book marked the birth of
what came to be called the
Scientific Revolution. With
it came final proof that the
ancients did not know it all
and that moderns might
strike out on their own in
new directions and reach
new heights—and they cer-
tainly did.

It could be argued that
just as printing made the
Protestant Reformation
possible, it also made the
Scientific Revolution possi-
ble.

New Anatomy

Just as Copernicus was
overturning Greek notions
of astronomy, a Flemish
anatomist, Andreas Vesa-
lius (1514-1564), was upset-
ting Greek notions of
anatomy. Unlike other anat-
omists of the period, Vesa-
lius was willing to trust his
own eyes when they dis-
agreed with the statements
of the Greeks.

He put together the re-
sults of his researches in a
book entitled De Corporis
Humani Fabrica (Concern-
ing the Structure of the
Human Body) in which he
corrected over two hundred
errors of Galen (see 180).
What's more, the book took
advantage of the technique

of printing to reproduce
careful illustrations of ana-
tomical facts, drawn by the
Flemish artist Jan Stephan
van Calcar (ca. 1499-after
1545), who had been a stu-
dent of Titian.

Vesalius's book was
published in 1543, the same
year in which Copernicus’s
book appeared, and this
double appearance
strengthens the feeling that
the year marks the begin-
ning of the Scientific Revo-
lution.

 

1545

 

Negative
Numbers

Until this time, mathemati-
cians had assumed that all
numbers, whether integers,
fractions, or irrationals,
had to be greater than zero.
It might seem, after all,

that one could not possibly
have less than nothing.

On the other hand,
mathematicians knew there
were such things as debts.
To have no money and to
owe a sum to someone else
means having less than no
money. This might seem
merely like practical busi-

ness, nothing to do with
ethereal numbers, but Car-
dano (see 1535) showed, in
1545, that debts and simi-
lar phenomena could be
treated as negative num-
bers, which would follow
rules of mathematics very
similar to those that ordi-
nary numbers did. You
 

could have negative inte-
gers, negative fractions,
and negative irrationals.
In that same year, Car-
dano worked out a general
solution for equations of
the fourth degree, involv-

4

ing x*.

 

Surgery

In ancient and medieval
times, surgery was looked
down upon as an inferior
branch of medicine, since it
involved working with
one’s hands and was un-
comfortably akin to butch-
ery and vivisection

 

Physicians therefore left the

matter of cutting the flesh
to those who also cut hair,
so that the profession of the

barber-surgeon was recog-
nized

One of the French bar-
ber-surgeons was Ambroise
Paré (1510
skillful enough te serve as
surgeon to Henry I of
France (1519-1559) and to

 

 

390), who was

his three sons. Paré is best
known for hi

 

improve-
ments in battle surgery
Most surgeons of the time
practiced searing, disin-
ing guns
with boiling oil and stop-
ping bleeding by cauteriz-
ing arteries (without
anesthetics, of course). A
torture chamber could
scarcely have been worse
than this treatment.

Paré¢ practiced cleanli-

 

   

fe ol wounds

ness instead. He used sooth-

ing oils instead of boilin
oils. He also tied olf the a:
teries rather than burnir
them shut. He managed

bring about far more cures

with an infinitesimal frac
tion of the pain, and he is

therefore considered the fa

 

ther of rational surgeny

his findings in this area in
1545. In those days, and for

Trigonometric
Tables

The German mathemati-
cian Georg Joachim Iserin
von Lauchen (1514-1576),

better known as Rhaticus

from the region of his birth,

was a student of Coperni-

  

cus and had been instru
mental in persuading him
to publish his book (see

1543). To help out with the

mathematics required to
determine planetary move-
ments, Rhiticus prepared
trigonometric tables; that

gth of the

 

is, ratios ol the

 

sides of tri

other for dilferent a
Such tables had been pre-
pared in the time of the
Greeks, but Rhiticus pre-
pared the best yet and, for
the first time, related the ra-
tios to the size of the angle
(as is now invariably done)
rather than to arcs of cir-
cles.

These trigonomeric ta-
bles, combined with Coper-
nicus’s heliocentric view,
made it possible for compu-
tational astronomy to take
a big leap forward.

Planetary Tables

Copernicus had pointed the
way to better determina-
tions of planetary motions,

but he had not made a
major effort himself to pro-
duce the necessary tables.
This was done in 1551
by the German mathemati-
cian Erasmus Reinhold
(1511-1553), with the back-
ing of Albert (1490—1568)
who was the last grand
master of the Teutonic
Knights. (This was a Catho-
lic order, but Albert led it
into Lutheranism in 1544
and made himself duke of
Prussia, the easternmost
German province.)
Reinhold went over Co-
pernicus’s mathematics,
sharpening and improving
it, then prepared what he
called Tabulae Prutenicae

(Prussian Tables) in honor
of his patron. They were
better than the Alfonsine
Tables of three centuries
earlier, which had been
based on Ptolemy’s mathe-
matics—but not much bet-
ter. The planetary system
had to be improved beyond
Copernicus if tables were to
be seriously improved, and
that wasn't to happen for
another half-century.

 

1552

 

Eustachian
Tube

Vesalius's new anatomy
(see 1543) spurred on the
field generally.

The Italian anatomist
Bartolommeo Eustachio
(1520-1574) prepared a

book on anatomy in 1552,
nine years after Vesalius's.
In some respects it was
more accurate than the ear-
lier book, but the illustra-
tions were not as beautiful.
Eustachio described a nar-
row tube connecting the
ear and the throat, which
has been known as the Eu-

stachian tube ever since,
though it may have been
discovered by a Greek phy-
sician, Alcmaeon (see 500
B.C., Dissection), two thou-
sand years before.

Eustachio was also the
first to describe the adrenal
glands.

Homologies

Anyone can see that living
organisms can be grouped.
Dogs and wolves resemble

each other more than either

resemble rabbits, for in-
stance. Cats, lions, and ti-
gers resemble each other.
Sheep and goats resemble
each other. Insects have a
common resemblance that
separates them from nonin-
sects, and so on.

This might have given
rise to evtxlulionary no-
tions, that some basic dog-
like animal had given rise
to both dogs and wolves, as
an example. However, the
Bible described all animals
as being created simultane-
ously and separately, and it
is possible to argue that

God may just have decided
to create animals in groups
for his own purposes.

It would be more im-
pressive if similarities
could be found in more
widely diverse organisms,
similarities that were not
too ebvious to the eyes.
This was done by a French
naturalist, Pierre Belon
(1517-1564).

Francis I of France
(1494-1547) was engaged
in a prolonged struggle
with Charles I of Spain,
who was also the Emperor
Charles V. Francis was des-
perate enough to ally him-
self with the Ottoman
Empire, and in 1546 he
sent Belon on a diplo-
matic mission to the
Ottomans.

This gave Belon a
chance to study plant and
animal life in the eastern
Mediterranean and to com-
pare it with life in France.
He was the first to describe,
in writings he published in
1555, basic similarities (ho-
mologies) in the skeletons of
all vertebrates, from fish to
humans. Such details as
the number of bones in the
limbs were remarkably con-
stant from animal to ani-
mal, regardless of the
difference in outer appear-
ance.

This could not help but
encourage evolutionary
thought, although it was to
be three centuries before it
came to fruition.

Mineralogy

Mining had been of interest
to human beings since the
development of metallurgy
some forty-five centuries be-
fore. At this time it also be-
came of interest to
medicine, as physicians
began to investigate min
eral remedies. An example

 

was Theophrastus Bom-
bastus von Hohenheim
(1493-1541), better known
as Paracelsus, a Swiss physi
cian who pioneered the use
of opium extracts but also
used compounds of mer
cury and antimony, even
after they had proved toxic

lustrations of mining ma-
chinery. It was the first
important book on miner-
als ever written and is usu-
ally considered to have
founded the science of min-
eralogy.

Tobacco

Native Americans were
quite willing to teach Euro-
pean arrivals the mysteries

of tobacco—how to prepare
the leaves, burn them, and
inhale the smoke. They
probably didn't intend this
as revenge for being en-
slaved and killed, but it
worked out that way. To-
bacco addiction settled
down on Europe and even-
tually on the rest of the
world. There is no estimate
of how much discomfort it
has caused in the way of
stench, how much natural
and property damage it has
caused in the way of forest
fires and building fires, and
how many people (smokers
and nonsmokers alike) it

has killed in those fires or
through lung cancer and
heart disease.

The first tobacco seeds
reached Spain in 1556.

A French diplomat,
Jean Nicot (ca. 1530—1600),
served as ambassador to
Portugal between 1559 and
1561 and sent tobacco
seeds to France. His name
is immortalized in nicotine,
the name of the highly poi-
sonous substance that is
the active ingredient in to-
bacco. An English naval
commander, John Hawkins
(1532—1595), introduced it
to England in 1565.

Scientific
Societies

Throughout history, scien-
tists have usually worked
alone because of the diffi-
culty of communication.
Sometimes they gathered
in some particular center of
learning, as in Athens, Alex-

andria, and Baghdad, but
even then their companion-
ship was a haphazard
thing.

The coming of printing
made it easier to record
and publish advances, how-
ever, and the affair of Tar-
taglia and Cardano (see
1535) made it important to
publish if one wanted

credit. There would be
value in exchanging infor-
mation, then, for it would
benefit all scientists in their
search for reputation.

In 1560 an Italian phys-
icist, Giambattista della
Porta (1535?-1615),
founded the first scientific
association designed partic-
ularly for this interchange
of ideas, the Academia Se-
cretorum Naturae (Academy
of the Mysteries of Nature).
It was closed down by the
Inquisition, which was
oversensitive to any gather-

1565

ings in those harsh days of
religious conflict, but the
idea was too goad to let go,
and other scientific socie-
ties were formed in time,
and persisted.

These societies helped
give rise to a scientific com-
munity that was as superior
to an individual scientist as
a phalanx or legion was to
an individual soldier.

By this time, the harquebus
had been refined to a mus-
ket. The word is from the
Latin word for “fly" and
had earlier been applied to
the bolts of crossbows, per-
haps because the crossbow

bolt or the musket ball
whizzed past one’s ear with
the buzz of a fly.

Muskets could fire balls
that penetrated armor, so
armor began to disappear.
There was no use in bear-
ing the weight if it offered
no protection.

For two centuries, mus-
kets remained the principle
small arms used by sol-
diers, but they were still dif-
ficult to handle and reload
and musketeers needed the
protection of pikebearers,

World Maps

Once the Age of Explora-
tion began, it became im-
portant to try to map the
world in general and to do
so accurately, so that
navigators could reach
their destinations more
easily.

The difficulty was that
one cannot map a spherical
surface on a plane surface
without distortion. Since
distortion is unavoidable,
therefore, one must find a
distortion that will remain
useful.

The answer was sup-
plied by a Flemish geogra-
pher, Gerhard Kremer
(1512-1594), better known
by his Latinized name, Ge-
rardus Mercator. In 1568,
Mercator perfected his cy-
lindrical projection.

Imagine a hollow cylin-

der encircling the Earth
and touching it all around
the equator. A light at the
Earth’s center can then be
imagined as casting the
shadow of the surface fea-
tures on the cylinder, and
the cylinder, when un-
wrapped, will carry a map
of the world, a Mercator
map.

In this map, the meridi-
ans of longitude are verti-
cal and parallel. Since, on
the sphere, the meridians of
longitude approach each
other and meet at the poles,
this means that in a Merca-
tor projection, the east-west
distances are increasingly
exaggerated as one travels
north or south from the
equator. The parallels of
latitude run horizontal and
parallel, as they do on the
sphere, but as one goes
north and south from the

equator, they spread out
more widely, too.

On such a map, Green-
land looks larger than Af-
rica, although in actual
fact, Africa is thirteen times
as large as Greenland.

Nevertheless, the Mer-
cator projection is useful
for navigators, because a
ship that travels in any con-
stant compass direction
moves in a straight line on
the Mercator projection but
in a curved line on any
other type of projection.

The cover of Mercator's
book of maps showed Atlas,
the mythological Greek
Titan, holding the world on
his shoulders. As a result,
that book and all later
books of maps have been
called atlases.

With Mercator, Greek
geography ended and mod-
ern geography began.

Supernova

A supernova, like the one
that had appeared in 1054,
blazed out in the constella-
tion of Cassiopeia, high in
the northern sky, in Novem-
ber 1572. The supernova of
1054 had gone unobserved
in Europe, but times had
changed.

A young Danish astron-
omer, Tycho Brahe (1546—
1601), usually known by his
first name, watched the
new star carefully from
night to night. When he
first saw it, it was brighter
than Venus, but it gradu-
ally faded until in March
1574, it could no longer be
seen at all. Tycho had
watched it for 485 days.

 

The Greeks had as-
sumed that the heavens (un-
like Earth) were perfect
and unchanging. Anythin
in the sky that seemed to
change (or to move in any
thing but a regular and pre-
dictable path) could not be
part of the sky, they
thought, but must be
of the atmosphere of the im-
perfect Earth. This in-
cluded clouds, shooting
stars, and comets.

The new star, being a
temporary phenomenon,
ought to be part of the at-
mosphere, 00, but al-
though Tycho tried to
determine its parallax (see
150 B.c.), he could detect
none. The new star must be
beyond the Moon and there

Northwest
Passage

The English, having failed
at the Northeast Passage
(see 1553), tried their hand
at the Northwest Passage
around the northern shores
of North America.

In 1576 an English nav-

igator, Martin Frobisher

(ca. 1535-1594), sailed to
North America with three
ships and thirty-five men.
He sailed northward from
the Labrador area and dis-
covered what we now call
Baffin Island, a large island
west of Greenland.

In a second voyage, in
1578, Frobisher sighted
Greenland itself (see 982).
By the time Frobisher ar-

rived, the Viking settlers
had died or departed and
its shores were occupied
only by Inuit (Eskimos).
From this time on, Green-
land remained part of
world geography.
Frobisher did not dis-
cover any practical North-
west Passage, however.

 

1577

 

Distance of
Comets

Tycho Brahe (see 1572),
with the help of the Danish

king, set up the first real as-

tronomical observatory, on
the island of Hven in the
strait between Denmark

and Sweden, outfitting it
with the best instruments
he could make.

In 1577 a bright comet
appeared in the sky and
Tycho observed it carefully.
By Greek notions, it was an
atmospheric phenomenon,
and therefore it should
have a large parallax. How-

ever, Tycho could find
none, and was certain that
it was at a distance far be-
yond that of the Moon. This
was another serious blow
against Greek astronomy.
1578

 

Drake Strait

The English navigator Fran-
cis Drake (1540 or 1543—
1596) had made a career
out of raiding the Spanish
possessions in the Americas
in the course of an unde-
clared war between En-
gland and Spain. It
occurred to him that the
Spanish settlements on the
Pacific coast of the Ameri-
cas were entirely unde-
fended because none of
Spain’s enemies had made
their way into the Pacific,
soin 1572 he had landed at
Panama, crossed the Isth-
mus, and became the first
Englishman to see the Pa-
cific.

1581

In 1577 he set sail on
an expedition that he
hoped would carry him
through the Strait of Magel-
lan, which so far only Span-
ish ships had passed
through. No one knew the
exact extent of Tierra del
Fuego, the land south of the
strait, and some thought it
was part of a vast Antarctic
continent.

Drake passed through
the Strait of Magellan in
1578 and was then struck
by a storm in the Pacific
and driven far enough
south to see that open
water lay to the south of
Tierra del Fuego, which
turned out to be nothing
more than a moderately

sized island. The water to
the south of that island has
been known as Drake Pas-
sage, or Drake Strait, ever
since.

Drake sailed up the Pa-
cific coast of the Americas
as far as what we now call
San Francisco Bay. He
found no water route that
would connect with the At-
lantic Ocean, so he decided
to sail westward across the
Pacific. He reached En-
gland in 1580, the first per-
son to circumnavigate the
globe since Magellan's ship
had done so six decades ear-
lier (see 1523).

 

Pendulum

In measuring time intervals
of less than a day, the point
is to find some physical ac-
tion that proceeds at a con-
stant rate. The sifting of
sand or the dripping of
water through a small hole,
the burning of a candle, or
the progress of the Sun
across the sky are all fairly
constant motions, but
might there not be some

convenient action that was
even more steadily con-
stant?

The first hint of a con-
stant action that was un-
known to the ancients came
in 1581, when a seventeen-
year-old Italian boy, Gali-
leo Galilei (1564—-1642),
who is usually known by
his first name, was at-
tending services at the Ca-
thedral of Pisa.

His attention was

caught by a chandelier that
swayed as air currents
caught it. Sometimes it
swung through a small arc,
sometimes through a larger
one, but to Galileo's inquir-
ing mind, there scemed an
anomaly: long or short, the
time it took the chandelier
to complete its swing back
and forth scemed the same.
He timed it by the beating
of his pulse. Upon re-
turning home, he set up
two pendulums of equal
length and swung one in
larger, one in smaller
sweeps. They kept together
and he found he was cor-
rect.

Nevertheless, when in
later life Galileo conducted
experiments in which it
was necessary to know the
time elapsed, he had to con-
tinue to use his pulse or
dripping water. Not for an-
other seven decades would
the steady beat of the pen-
dulum be put to use as a de-
vice to help measure time.

. o
Siberia
Despite Russia's vast extent

over eastern Europe, its
long sleep under the Mon-

gols had left it technologi-
cally backward. On
Russia’s western bound-
aries were the Swedes, the
Poles, and the Germans,
with none of whom Russia
could compete militarily.
Toward the east, how-
ever, were vast spaces that
at the moment contained
no formidable enemy. This
was also a cold region that
would ordinarily not seem
very enticing except that,
as in Russia’s European
north, there were animals
living there whose pelts,
adapted to the Arctic cold,
were thick and valuable.
In 1581, as Ivan IV’s
reign approached its end,
the Stroganovs, a Russian
family that had made a for-

tune in the fur trade, em-
ployed a Cossack named
Yermak Timofievich (?—
1584) to explore eastward
and expand the Stroganov
fur trade. Yermak con-
quered a Mongol kingdom
east of the Urals, named
Sibir. The name (Siberia in
English) came to be applied
to the entire northern third
of Asia. This was the begin-
ning of a process that
would eventually lead the
Russians to the Pacific
Ocean and put an end for-
ever to the raids of central
Asian nomads against the
settled regions to its south
and west.

 

1582

 

Gregorian
Calendar

The Julian calendar,
adopted by Julius Caesar
(see 46 B.C.), was not quite

correct. It assumed a year
that was 365.25 days long,
but the year was more
nearly 365.2422 days long.
If the year were exactly
365.25 days long, that extra
quarter-day could be made

up for by adding an extra
day every fourth year. Then
every fourth year would be
366 days long (leap year),
and in the space of 400
years there would be 100
leap years.
 
 

A year that is 36
days long is about 365700
days long. This means that
there should be only 97
leap years every 400 years,
not 100. By the Julian calen-
dar, 3 days too many were
added every 400 years, and
the vernal equinox fell ear-
lier and earlier. If the ver-
nal equinox was on March
21 when the Julian calen-
dar was established, then
by 1582 it would fall on
March 11, 10 days too
early

The Church was very
involved in this because the
holy days depended on the
calendar, and if the drift
continued, Easter would

eventually come in winter
and Christmas in the au-

tumn, However, earlier at
tempts to reform the

 

calendar had failed, for peo

Decimal
Fractions

Mathematicians had found
fractions difficult to handle
ever since the days of the
Sumerians. Special rules
had to be worked out to
deal with them. In 1586,
however, Stevin (see 1583)
showed that they could be

made part of ordinary posi-
tional notation. To the
right of the units column
(on the other side of a deci-
mal point) could be the
tenths column, then the
hundredths column, and so
on. Thus 2'2 would become
2.25; 2's would become
2.125; 27/s would become
2.875; and so on.

The disadvantage of

such decimal fractions is
that some never end. Thus
23 is 2.3333333 . . . forever;
2% 1s 2.8333333 . . . forever;
and so on. Despite this, dec-
imal fractions greatly sim-
plified computations
involving fractions.

 

1589

 

Falling Bodies

Aristotle had stated that
the heavier an object was,
the more rapidly it would
fall. It seemed reasonable
to say so. Why shouldn’t a
heavier body fall more rap-
idly? It is clearly being at-
tracted to Earth more
strongly, or it wouldn’t be

heavier. Furthermore, any-
one who watches a feather,
a leaf, and a stone falling
will see at once that the
stone falls faster than the
leaf, which in turn falls
faster than the feather.
The trouble is that
light objects are impeded
by air resistance, and in
order to avoid that one

should consider only rela-
tively heavy objects. Thus,
if one observes the falling
of a rock that weighs 1
pound and another that
weighs 10 pounds, air resis-
tance is insignificant in ei-
ther case. Do we then see
that the 10-pound rock nev-
ertheless falls faster than
the 1-pound rock?
In 1586, Simon Stevin
(see 1583) is supposed to
have dropped two rocks at
the same time, one consid-
erably heavier than the
other, and showed that
they struck the ground at
the same time. Later ac-
counts said it was Galileo
who demonstrated this by
dropping different weights
simultaneously from the
Leaning Tower of Pisa.
Both stories may or may
not be true.

What is certain,
though, is that in 1589 Gali-
leo started a series of metic-
ulous tests with falling
baodies. Such bodies fall too
rapidly to make it easy to
measure the rate of fall ac-
curately, especially since
no accurate way of measur-
ing short periods of time
had yet been worked out.

Galileo therefore al-
lowed balls to roll down in-
clined planes. The more
nearly level the plane, the
more slowly the balls
moved under the pull of
gravity and the more easily
their rate of fall could be
measured by primitive
methods such as water drip-
ping out of a small hole. In
this way Galileo found it
quite easy to show that as
long as the balls were
heavy enough to be rela-
tively uninfluenced by air
resistance, they rolled
down an inclined plane at
the same rate.

He was also able to
show that the balls rolled
down the inclined plane
with a constant accelera-
tion—that is, they gained
speed with time at a con-
stant rate, under the con-
stant pull of gravity.

This settled another im-
portant point. Aristotle had
held that in order to keep a
body moving, a force bad to
be continually applied.
This again seemed to fit ob-
servation. If an object were
sent sliding across a floor,
it would quickly slow to a
stop. To keep it moving,
you would have to keep
pushing.

For this reason, it was
felt that the planets in their
eternal movement about
the Earth had to be continu-
ally pushed by angels.

Galileo’s observations
showed that a constant
push was not necessary to
keep an object moving, if
friction was removed. If a
constant pull was exerted
by gravity, for instance, an
object moved with a con-
stantly increasing speed.
Consequently, no angels
were required to keep the
planets moving.

Galilea's experiments
on moving bodies were so
impressive that, even
though he was not the first
to conduct experiments—
Peter Peregrinus had done
so more than three centu-
ries before (see 1269)—he is

usually given eredit for hav-
ing founded experimental
science.

Cryptanalysis

Simple codes are almost as
old as writing itself. After
all, by substituting or rear-
ranging words or letters ac-
cording to some
prearranged scheme, some-
thing that remains plain to
the people involved may be
made totally obscure 1o oth-
ers. In such cases, you have
a code or cryptogram.

Codes that can be
made can be broken, and as
the years went by, the use
of ever more subtle meth-
ods of encoding messages
were countered by ever
more subtle methods of de-
coding them.

An early example of
this came in 1589, when
France was in the last
stages of a civil war. Henry
I11(1551-1589) had no di-
rect heirs, and his second
cousin, Henry of Navarre
(1553-1610), was the logi-
cal successor. Henry of Na-
varre was a Huguenot,
however, and was bitterly
opposed, not only by
French Catholics but by
Philip II of Spain.

Philip 11 was using a
code that the French mathe-
matician Francois Viete
(1540-1603; in Latin Fran-
ciscus Vieta), working for
Henry of Navarre, was able
 

 

to decode in 1589. Philip II,
unable to account for the
fact that his messages were
being read, complained to
Pope Sixtus V (1521-1590)
that the French were using
sorcery and ought to suffer
ecclesiastical punishment
as a result.

Knitting
Machines

It is possible to build a de-
vice that will imitate the
motions of the hands or
feet, where such motions
are endlessly repeated and
do not call for the guide of
continuous intelligence.

 

In 1589 an English cler-
gyman, William Lee
(1550?—1610), invented a
device called a stocking
frame that would knit
faster than hand-knitters
could produce their prod-
ucts. This great advantage
of the stocking frame was
also its great disadvantage,
for if it were put into opera-
tion on a large scale, it
would throw hand-knitters
out of work. Elizabeth I of
England refused to grant
Lee a patent for that very
reason.

Lee therefore took his
machine to France where
he received the necessary
support.

Lee's experiences in En-
gland are an early example
of how the threat of techio-
logical unemployment can
slow technological ad-
vance. To be sure, techno-
logical advance creates
more new jobs than it de-
stroys, but there is always a
painful transition period,
and a humane government
must help those who suffer,
not so much out idealism
(though what is wrong with
that?) as to keep society sta-
ble and to make it easier to
extend the benefits of tech-
nological advance to soci-
ety in general.
 

1590

 

Microscopes

It must have dawned on
people rather early that
there were ways of making
small objects appear larger
in size. Dewdrops on a leaf
or on a blade of grass will
make the surface they rest
on look larger. Spheres of
glass will do the same.

The people who would
most notice this sort of

1591

thing and be most con-
cerned with it were the
spectacle-makers, since the
convex lenses used to cor-
rect far-sightedness acted
to magnify objects.

The spectacle-making
industry was most ad-
vanced in the Netherlands
at this time. It occurred to
a Dutch spectacle-maker,
Zacharias Janssen (1580-
ca. 1638), that if one lens

magnified somewhat, two
would magnify to a greater
extent. He placed a convex
lens at each end of a tube
and found that magnifica-
tion was indeed improved.
The improvement wasn't
great, but Janssen’s tube
can be viewed as the first
microscope, and its descen-
dants were to revolutionize
biology.

 

Algebraic
Symbols

Until now, mathematicians
had described quantities,
relationships, and prob-
lems in words (it seemed
the only way), and what
they described was often
hard to envisage.

Vieta (see 1589, Crypt-

1592

analysis) began to symbol-
ize constants and un-
knowns by letters of the
alphabet, the now familiar
x’s and y's of algebra. In
1591, he wrote a book
about algebra that was the
first a present-day high-
school student would recog-
nize at a glance to be deal-
ing with that subject.

The progression from

words to symbols was to
mathematics something
like the progression from
ideographs to letters in or-
dinary writing, or from
Roman numerals to Arabic
numerals in arithmetical
computation.

 

Thermometer

The concept of hot and cold
must be as old as human-
ity. We can all tell when an

object is hot or cold by plac-
ing the hand near it (not
even necessarily on it). We
can also tell if one subject
is substantially warmer

than another. Such subjec-
tive sensations are useless,
however, where small dif-
ferences in temperature are
concerned and are, in any
 

 

case, untrustworthy. A
humid day feels hotter than
a dry day at the same tem-
perature; a windy day
colder than a calm day

at the same tempera-

ture.

What is needed is some
physical phenomenon that
changes regularly in a mea-
surable way with changes
in temperature, and the
first person to attempt to
find such a phenomenon
was Galileo (see 1581).

He warmed an empty
bulb with a long tube ex-
tending from it, then
placed the open end of the
long tube into a container
of water. As the warm air
within the bulb cooled, it
contracted, and water was
drawn up into the tube. As
temperature changed and

1596

the air within the bulb
cooled or warmed, the
water level rose or fell ac-
cordingly, and from the po-
sition of the level, one
could judge the tempera-
ture.

This was a very crude
device, because for one
thing the water level was
also affected by the air pres-
sure upon the water reser-
voir. Nevertheless, it was
the first thermometer (from
Greek words meaning “to
measure heat”).

Archaeology

The cities of Pompeii and
Herculaneum, near the
base of Mt. Vesuvius in
southern Italy, had been
buried under lava and ash
when the volcano unexpect-

edly erupted on August 24,
9%

For fifteen centuries
they remained hidden,
until an Italian engineer,
Domenico Fontana (1543—
1607), began tunneling
under a hill in order to es-
tablish an aqueduct. The
ruins were discovered in
the process.

This brought the real-
ization that part of the past
was actually preserved for
investigation in the pres-
ent. Excavation for the de-
liberate purpose of
studying the past did not
start for another century,
but the subject matter of
the study was known to be
waiting, so this discovery
might be viewed as the be-
ginning of modern archaeol-
0gy.

 

East Indies

After the defeat of the Span-
ish Armada, the Nether-
landers were heartened and
fought more fiercely than
ever. This was especially
true among the northern
Protestant half of the coun-
try, which eventually came
to be known as the Dutch
Republic. The southern half
remained Catholic and
under Spanish dominion
and was called the Spanish
Netherlands.

The Dutch, growing
stronger at sea and becom-
ing wealthy through sea
trade despite the Spanish
soldiers who harassed
them, looked for expansion
overseas. They had no hesi-
tation in invading lands
that were supposedly re-
served for the Spanish and
Portuguese (both ruled by
Philip II). After all, they
were anti-Catholic, anti-
Spanish, and pro-money.

In 1596, therefore, the
Dutch set up a factory at Pa-

lembang in the island of Su-
matra, in what came to be
called the East Indies. That
was the start of a Dutch
overseas empire.

Pi

The ancient Greeks had
their favorite problems and
one of them was squaring
the circle; that is, given a
circle of a particular size,
to construct a square with
the same area. The rules
were that you could only

i
use a straight-edge (some-
thing that would draw
straight lines) and a com-
pass (something that would
draw circles) and you had
to do it in a finite number
of steps. Unfortunately,
they could never solve that
problem.

In working with it,
though, they got involved

with the ratio of the circum-

ference of a circle to its di-
ameter, a ratio that we now
refer to as pi (one of the
Greek letters). Anyone can
measure the diameter and
then run a piece of string

around the circumference,
straighten it, and measure
that, too. It turns out that
the circumference (for any
circle at all) is just a little
over 3 times as long as the
diameter. But what is the
ratio exactly?

There are geometric
ways of trying to get the
exact ratio, and Archi-
medes (se
ten a figure of about 3.142.
Better values were ob-
tained in later centuries
until, in 1596, the Dutch
mathematician Ludolf van
Ceulen (1540-1610) ob-

   

 

> 260 B.c.) had got-

tained a value of pi to
twenty decimal places
(Later in life, he

Even that didn

  

an exact value, but it was so
nearly exact that no reason
able computation involving
pi would need a more exact
value. (In Germany, pi is
still sometimes called Lu-

dolf's number.) Since then

 

pi has been obtained to a

Medieval
Alchemy

The medieval alchemists
didn’t achieve much of
what they would have liked
to achieve. They didn't
manufacture gold out of
lead, and they didn’t find
the elixir of life. However,

 

they weren't totally useless,

either.

In 1597 a German al-
chemist, Andreas L
1540-1616), better known
by the Latinized form of his
name as Libavius, wrote a
book entitled Alchemnia in
which he summarized me

 

dieval achievements in al-
chemy. It was the first

chemical textbook worthy
of the name. Libavius

wrote clearly rather than

 

miystically. He was

to describe the

 

of hvdrochloric acid, and

le gave clear direc

tions for
preparing o

acids such

 

and aqua

water 1 nuxture of sutiu
ric and nitric acids that
was so powerful it would
even dissolve the royal
metal, gold).

With Libavius’s book,
the stage was set for the
birth of real chemistry two-
thirds of a century later

Earth as Magnet

Although the compass had
been known for nearly five
centuries, no one knew why
it pointed north. The En-
glish physician and physi-
cist William Gilbert (1544~
1603) put it to the test and
published a book, De Mag-
nete (Concerning Magnets),
in 1600 in which he de-
scribed his experiments.
For instance, he tested
the general opinion that
garlic would destroy mag-
netism and that diamonds
would produce it. He
rubbed magnets with garlic

 

 

 

and the magnetism did not
disappear. He rubbed un-
magnetized iron with dia-
monds and magnetism did
not appear. He took the pre-
caution of doing this before
witnesses.

The most important
thing he did, however, was
to take a large piece of load-
stone and fashion a globe
out of it. He located its mag-
netic poles and showed that
a compass needle would
point north if placed near
the surface of this spherical
magnet.

What’s more, if he ar-
ranged for the compass nee-

dle to swivel vertically, it
showed what was called
magnetic dip, for it pointed
straight through the body
of the object. In fact, if the
compass needle was held
above the magnetic pole, it
pointed straight down.
(Magnetic dip was first
noted on Earth'’s surface by
an English navigator, Rob-
ert Norman [1560-?], in
1576.)

Gilbert concluded,
then, that compass needles
acted the way they did be-
cause Earth itself was a
huge magnet.

Vein Valves

That blood moves is cer-
tain, for when an artery is
cut, blood emerges in
spurts. The spurts are in
time with the beating of
the heart, so that the
heart clearly pumps the
blood.

The classical belief, in-
herited from Galen (see
180), was that the blood
was manufactured in the
liver and carried to the
heart, from which it was
pumped outward through
arteries and veins alike and
consumed in the tissues.

Of course, the heart is
actually two pumps, with a
thick muscular wall be-
tween, but there seemed no
reason for two pumps. It
was Galen's notion that
there were small holes in
the wall, too small to be vis-
ible, and that through these
the blood passed, con-
verting the heart into a sin-
gle pump.

In 1603 an Italian phy-
sician, Girolamo Fabrici
(1537—-1619), better known
by his Latinized name of
Fabricius ab Aquapen-
dente, studied the veins of
the legs and noted that they

had little valves along their
length.

It was clear that the
valves prevented the blood
from flowing downward.
Muscular action during
walking squeezed the leg
veins and forced the blood
upward because that was
the only direction in which
it could go. This meant that
the blood in the leg veins
could move only teward the
heart.

Fabricius, however,

did not dare to go against
Galen's doetrine and he
refused to draw this
conclusion.

Jamestown

Since the defeat of the
Spanish Armada (see 1589)
the English had been trying
to make settlements over-
seas. They had succeeded in
Newfoundland but had
failed at Roanoke.

Finally, on May 24,
1607, a party of English
settlers, with John Smith
(ca. 1580-1631) the most
prominent member,
landed in what is now the
state of Virginia. They
moved up the James
River (named for James I

of England) and founded
Jamestown,

This was the first per-
manent English settlement
in the territory of what is
now the United States.

 

1608

 

Telescope

After the invention of the
microscope (see 1590), it
wouldn't have taken much
to work out lens combina-
tions that would magnify
distant objects, or make
them appear closer.

The discovery seems to
have come about in 1608
through accident. Hans Lip-
pershey (ca. 1570-1619), a
Dutch spectacle-maker, had
an apprentice who was

playing with lenses during
an idle moment and found
that if he held two lenses in
front of his eyes, one at a
distance from the other,
and looked through both,
he saw a distant church
steeple that seemed consid-
erably closer than it was,
and upside down, too.
Startled, he told his
master, who grasped the
importance of the discovery
at once. Lippershey
mounted the lenses in a

tube that placed them at
the proper distance from
each other and had the first
primitive zelescope (from
Greek words meaning “to
see far”).

The Netherlands was
still in rebellion against
Spain, and Lippershey real-
ized that a telescope would
be an important war
weapon, making it possible
to see the approach of
enemy ships or troops be-
fore they could be made out
 

by the eye alone. He ex-
plained this to Maurice of
Nassau (see 1586), who saw
the point and made an at
tempt to keep the nature of
the device secret. The elfort
failed, however. Rumors
spread, and the device was
too simple not to be recon-
structed at once

Quebec

The French explorer Sam-
uel de Champlain (ca.
1567—1635) was commis-

sioned by Henry 1V of
France to explore that por-
tion of the North American
coasl reached by Cartier
35). From 1603 on
he explored the St. Law-

Planetary Orbits

For nearly two thousand
years, since Plato (see 387
B.C.), it had been taken for
granted that planetary or-
bits were circles, if only be-
cause the circle was the
simplest curve and there-
fore the most elegant and
esthetic. Surely the heavens
would not deal with any-
thing else.

Planetary movements,
however, did not match the

notion of simple circular or-
bits, and the Greeks had to
assume combinations of cir-
cles that grew more and
more complicated as obser-
vations of actual planetary
motions across the sky
grew more precise
Copernicus placed the
Sun, rather than the Earth
at the center of the Uni
verse, but kept circular os
bits, which meant that
there still had to be compli
cated combinations, al-

though not quite as

Kepler tried to work out an
orbit that would best fit the
data Tycho had gathered.

Kepler tried a number
of things that didn’t work
and was finally driven to
the all-but-unthinkable al-
ternative of considering or-
bits that were not circles
Finally, he had his answer
and, in 1609, published
it in a book entitled
Astrononiia Nova (New As-
tronomy). In it, he main-
tained that planets moved
about the Sun in ellipses
(flattened circles whose geo-
metric properties had first
been explained by the
Greek mathematician Apol-
lonius in the first century
B.C.). The Sun was located
at one of the two foci of the
ellipse, and with such or-
bits, no curve combinations
were required. Our present
picture of the Solar System
(that is, the Sun plus its ret-
inue of planets and other
bodies) remains essentially
that worked out by Kepler
No substantial change is ex-
pected in the future.

The elliptical orbit is
Kepler’s First Law of plane-
tary motion. He also ad-
vanced a Second Law in his

 

book, which described how
the planetary speed altered
with distance from the Sun.
With the Sun at one focus
of an ellipse, the planet was
closer to the Sun (and
moved faster) in one half of
the orbit than in the other.

The Milky Way

The Milky Way is a dim
band of foggy light that en-
circles the sky. Many were
the speculations as to what
it was. It might be a spurt
of milk from a goddess’s
breast, or it might be a
bridge used by the gods to
travel from Earth to
Heaven or vice versa. De-
mocritus (see 440 B.C.) sug-
“t’\[Ld that the Milky Way
a conglomeration of
vast numbers of stars that
were individually too dim
to be seen. That, however,

 

 

 

was just a speculation.

In 1609, however, Gali-
leo heard rumors of the con-
struction of a telescope in
the Netherlands the year
before. From what he
heard, he had little trouble
devising a telescope for
himself, and for the first

time, he turned one on the
sky.

When he looked at the
Milky Way through the tele-
scope, he found that it was
indeed composed of a myr-
iad of faint stars. Democri-
tus had been absolutely
correct.

In fact, wherever Gali-
leo looked he saw addi-
tional stars that, without
the telescope, were too dim
to be seen. The sky was full
of them.

Moon

Galileo also looked at the
Moon through his tele-
scope. He found that it con-
tained craters, mountains,
and dark areas that he
thought might be seas.
These dark areas are still
called maria, which is the
Latin word for “seas.” It
was quite obvious that the
Moon was not a heavenly
globe of light, but was a
world that in some ways re-
sembled Earth. Aristotle’s
notion that heavenly bodies
were of a structure differ-
ent from that of Earth thus
received a blow.

 
 

1610

 

Jupiter

Other than the Sun and the
Moon, the planets known to
the ancients were seen
merely as points of light
When Galileo turned his
telescope on them, how-
ever, he found that they ex-
panded into little orbs.
Clearly, they were extended
bodies but were tov small,
or too distant, or both, to
show as orbs to the unaided
eve. (The stars, however,
remained points of light
even when viewed by
telescope.)

Jupiter was not only an
orb but, in January 1610,
Galileo observed four dim-
mer objects in its immedi-
ale vicinity. As he watched
from night to night, he saw
that they were circling Jupi-
ter, as the Moon circles the
Earth. They were, in short,
four moons of Jupiter
Kepler (see 1609) later re-
ferred to them as satellites,
a Latin word referring to
those who remain close to

 

someone rich or powerful
in the hope of picking up
scraps and favors

Jupiter’s four satellites
were the first objects ever
seen in the sky that clearly
circled some object other
than Earth, which was a
strong point against Ptol
emy’s geocentrism. For that
reason, the discovery dis-
pleased the rigidly reli-
gious. Some refused to |
through the telescope in

 

order to avoid seeing the
satellites. One pointed out
that since the satellites
were not mentioned by Aris-
totle, they clearly did not
exist

Seeking support from
Cosimo IT (1590-1621) of
the Medici family, who in
1609 had become grand
(an [

 

duke of Tuscan

 

state with its capital at

Florence), Ga

the satellites “'the

Sunspots

Galileo (like others at about
the same time) also found
that the disk of the Sun had

1612

dark spots on it. These are
now called sunspots.

This was particularly
annoying to the religious
conservatives, since they
had accepted the Sun as a
symbol of God and felt that
it, of all objects, ought to be
perfect.

 

Andromeda
Nebula

In 1612 Simon Marius (see
1610) noted a fuzzy spot in
the constellation of Andro-
meda. It did not have the

sharp, pointlike quality of a  seem very important at the

star, but seemed a tiny lu- time, but three centuries
minous cloud. Indeed, it later it would initiate a dis-

Logarithms

Numbers can be written in
exponential form. Thus, 24
is four twos multiplied to-
gether, or 16; while 25 is
five twos multiplied to-
gether, or 32. Nine twos
multiplied together, or 2°,
is 512. Since 16 X 32 =
512, we can say that 2% X
25 = 27, Instead of multi-
plying numbers, we add ex-
ponents. This turns out to
be a general rule. In the
same way, instead of divid-
ing numbers, we can sub-
tract exponents.

If 16 is 2% and 32 is 25,
then 22 must be 2 to some
exponent that lies between
4 and 5. If we had the expo-
nents for all numbers listed

in a convenient table, multi-

plication would be reduced
to addition, and division
to subtraction, with a

 

great saving in time and
trouble

The Scottish mathema-
tician John N r (1550-
1617) spent years working
out formulas that would
give him appropriate expo-
nents for a great many num-
bers, and he called them
logarithms (from Greek
words meaning “propor-
tionate numbers”). In 1614,
Napier published his table
of logarithms and they at
once became useful in all

 

 

 

sorts of complicated com-
putations that scientists
were forced to make. Noth-
ing better was to come
along for over three centu-
ries.

Baffin Bay

The search for the North-
west Passage continued.
The English explorer Wil-
liam Baffin (ca. 1584-1622)
in 1615 sailed his ship up
the western coast of Green-
land into a stretch of water
now known as Baffin Bay.
By 1616 he had made his
way northward to nearly 78
degrees North Latitude.
That placed him within 800
miles of the North Pole, and

no one would get closer to
that for two and a half cen-
turies. Baffin concluded,
correctly, that there was no
practical Northwest Pas-
sage.

Tierra del Fuego

Drake had seen open water
south of Tierra del Fuego
(see 1578). In January 1616
the Dutch navigator Jakob
Le Maire (1585—1616)
sailed around the southern

end of Tierra del Fuego,
studying its coasts in de-
tail, and showed it to be an
island with an area of
about 18,000 square miles.
It was the most southerly
piece of land to have been
reached by prehistorical hu-
manity. Its southernmost
point is named Cape Horn,
after the Dutch city of
Hoorn, where the ship's
captain, Willem Cornelis-
zoon Schouten (ca. 1580—
1625), was born.

Stagecoaches

A stagecoach is any horse
and carriage that travels be-
tween set places (stages) ac-
cording to a fixed timetable
and accepts passengers for
pay. Such things came into
use at about this time.
Stagecoaches allowed
people without money
enough to own a horse to
be carried from one place

to another more quickly
than in any other way.
There were disadvantages,
of course. You had to ride
with strangers, at a time
and to a place that suited
the coach-owners and not
necessarily yourself. Never-
theless, it was much more
convenient than having to
walk or try to hitch a ride
in a farmer’s cart.

The stagecoach re-

mained the fastest means of
overland travel (for the rela-
tively impecunious) for
over two centuries.

Scientific
Method

The English philosopher

Francis Bacon (1561-1626)
published Novum Organum
(New Organon) in 1620. The
reference is to Aristotle's
Organon, in which the rules
of logic were drawn up (sec
350 B.c., Logic)

Bacon argued strenu-
sly that deduction might

Refraction

The action of lenses had
been known from ancient
times. Archimedes (see 260
B.c.), according to a doubt-
ful story, used large lenses
to focus sunlight and set
the Roman ships afire when
they were besieging Syra-
cuse. Obviously, light had
to be benl in passing
through them

The first to make a
mathematical study of this

was a Dutch mathemati-
cian, Willebrord Snel
(1580-1626)

It was known that
when a beam of light

 

passed from air to a denser
medium, such as
glass, and struck the sur

Slide Rules

[t was not long after the dis-
covery of logarithms by Na-
pier (see 1614) that the
matter became mecha-
nized. An English mathe-
matician, William
Oughtred (1574—1660), pre-

pared two rulers along
which logarithmic scales
were laid off. By manipulat-
ing the rulers one against
the other, calculations
could be performed me-
chanically by means of log-
arithms.

The instrument, modi-

fied and improved, became
the slide rule that scientists
and engineers carried
about with them constantly
until it was replaced three
and a half centuries later
by pocket computers.

 

1624

 

Gas

Air was considered by the
Greeks to be one of the four
elements that made up the
Earth. To them, and to
those who followed them,
any vapor was a kind of air.
The Flemish physician
Jan Baptista van Helmont
(1579—1644) worked with

vapors, however, and it
seemed clear to him that
some vapors had properties
so different from others,
and from ordinary air, that
they represented different
substances. Just as there
were different liquids and
solids, so there were differ-
ent airs.

In 1624 Helmont felt he

needed a word to use for
such airs generally. It
seemed to him that since
airs had no specific volume
but filled any container,
they were examples of mat-
ter in complete chaos. He
called them chaos, spelling
the word according to its
pronunciation in Flemish
so that it came out gas. The
term did not become popu-
lar at once, but eventually
it gained equality with lig-
uid and solid to represent
the three ordinary states of
matter.

In particular, Helmont
studied the gas produced
by burning wood. He called
this gas sylvestre (wood
gas), but we know it as car-
bon dioxide.

Helmont also con-

Planetary Tables

If Kepler’s elliptical plane-
tary orbits (see 1609) really
presented an advance over
the circular orbits of both
Prolemy and Copernicus,
then using them ought to re-
sult in improved planetary
tables.

Kepler spent some
years working out new ta-
bles on the basis of his ellip-
tical orbits, using Napier's
logarithms (see 1614) in his
calculations—the first im-
portant scientific use of the

new technique, In 1627
they were published as the
Rudolphine Tables, in mem-
ory of Rudolf IT (1552-
1612), who had become
Holy Roman Emperor in
1576 and who had sup-
pul'lcd KL'plL'l'.
They were in

  

:d the
best tables of planetary mo-
tions yet prepared. The pub-
lication included tables of
logarithms and a star map
based on the work of Tycho
and expanded by Kepler
include over a thousand

the aurochs declined, until

land. The herd continued te
dwindle, and the last one
died in 1627. This was an
example of how easy it is
for large and magnificent

animals to vanish. They
had not been killed in

anger. There was merely no

room left for them. The
room was needed for their
domesticated descendants.

 

1628

 

Blood
Circulation

The idea of Galen (see 180)
that the heart was a single
pump and that there were
pores in the thick muscular
wall separating the right
ventricle from the left ven-
tricle was not universally
accepted.

In 1242 an Arabic
scholar, Ibn an-Nafis
(d. 1288), wrote a book in
which he suggested that the
right and left ventricles
were totally separate
Blood was pumped out of
the right ventricle into ar-
teries that led it to the
lung. There, in the lungs,
the arteries divided into
smaller and smaller ves-

 

sels, within which the
blood picked up air from
the lungs. The vessels were
then collected into larger
and larger vessels until
they were brought back to
the left ventricle from
which the blood was
pumped out to the body
generally.

In this way, the double
pump was explained. One
pump was needed for the
lungs and aeration; the
other for the rest of the
body. An-Nafis had grasped
the lesser circulation. How-
ever, his book was not
known to the West until
1924, and it had no effect
on later developments.

In 1553 a Spanish phy-
sician, Miguel Serveto,
known as Michael Servetus

(1511-1553), published a
book in which he too de-
scribed the lesser circula-
tion. The major part of the
book, however, dealt with
the Servetus's theological
views, which were Unitar-
ian. Servetus, having ven-
tured into Geneva, which
was ruled by his deadly
enemy, John Calvin (see
1541), was taken into cus-
tody and burned at the
stake.

Calvin then attempted
to destroy all copies of
Servetus’s book, and it
wasn't till 1694 that some
unburned copies were
found.

In 1559 an Italian
anatomist, Realdo Colombo
(15162-1559), became the
third person to understand,
independently, the lesser
circulation. His work was
the first to reach the medi-
cal profession, and it was
much more detailed and
careful than those of his
two predecessors, so it is
Colombo who gets credit
for the discovery.

Then came the English
physician William Harvey
(1578-1657). He studied
the heart carefully and no-
ticed that each side had

valves that allowed blood
to enter each of the two ven-
tricles but not to leave ex-
cept by way of arteries.

He also knew about the
valves in the veins, since he
had studied under Fabrici
(see 1603), who had discoy-
ered them. He experi-
mented with animals, tying
off a vein or an artery and
noting that the blood piled
up in a vein on the side
away from the heart, but in

an artery on the side to-
ward the heart. It was clear
to him that blood flowed
away from the heart in ar-
teries and back to the heart
in veins.

By 1628, he had all the
evidence he needed and he
published a seventy-two-
page book in the Nether-
lands with the title De
Mot Cordis et Sangtiinis
{Concerming the Mations of
the Heart and Blood). In it,
he advanced his findings
concerning the circulation
of the blood: It leaves the
right ventricle, goes to the
lungs, and returns to the
left ventricle. It then leaves

the left ventricle, goes to
the body generally, and re-
turns to the right ventricle
to begin all over.

The book was received
sourly by the medical pro-

fession, but Harvey lived
long enough to see it ac-
cepted. His book represents
the beginning of modern
physiology.

®
Science and
Religion
Galileo had long accepted
the Copernican idea of a he-
liocentric planetary system,
but he was reluctant to be
open in this view, for the pa-
pacy was strong in Italy
and geocentrism was the
only allowable astronomi-
cal view in Catholic doc-
trine of the time.

Urban VIII (1568—
1644) had become Pope in
1623, and Galileo thought
him to be a friend. In 1632,
therefore, he took the

chance of publishing a book
with the title, in English,
Dialogue on the Two Chief
World Systems. The dia-
logue has three actors: a
Ptolemy-supporter, a Co-
pernicus-supporter, and a
neutral person seeking in-
formation.

The book created a stir.
In the first place, it was
written in Italian rather
than in Latin, so that it was
not confined to scholars but
could reach the general
public. In the second place,
Galileo was a brilliant
writer, much given to sar-
casm, and he certainly gave

the Copernican the best of
it. What's more, it was easy
to persuade the Pope that
the Ptolemy-supporter was
meant to be a satire on him
personally.

Galileo was therefore
brought before the Inquisi-
tion in the most famous
confrontation between sci-
ence and religion prior to
the evolution controversy
in the present century.

On June 22, 1633,
under the threat (but not
the use) of torture, he was
forced to renounce any of
his views that were at vari-
ance with geocentrism.
 

Sometimes Galileo is
blamed for giving in, but he
was seventy at the time,
and he had the example of
Bruno (see 1600), a genera

Magnetic
Declination

Gilbert's demonstration
that the Earth was a mag-
net (see 1600) could be used
to explain the fact that the
compass needle did not nec-
essarily point to the truth
north. If the Earth's mag-
netic north pole were not lo-
cated at the geographic
north pole, and if the com-
pass needle pointed to the
magnetic north pole, then
naturally it would not nec-
essarily point true north.

What's more, if the mag-
netic pole were on the At-
lantic side of the
geographic north pole, then
one crossed the Atlantic

 

from east to west, the com-
pass needle would begin by

Analytic
Geometry

The French mathematician
René Descartes (1596—
1650) published, in 1637,
his Discours de la méthode
(Discussions on the Method)
—of finding scientific

truth by good reasoning,
that is.

In a hundred-page ap-
pendix to this book, Des-
cartes combined algebra
and geometry. He pointed
out that if one drew two
perpendicular straight
lines, marked the intersec-
tion 0, and laid off units on
each line, positive numbers
to the right and up, nega-
tive numbers to the left and
down, then every point in
the plane could be repre-
sented by two numbers,
one for its position along
the horizontal axis and the

second for its position
along the vertical axis.
(One could add a third axis,
in and out, and locate every
point in the Universe by
three numbers.)

Straight lines and
curves could then be ex-
pressed by algebraic equa-
tions, which would locate
every point on the line or
curve with reference to the
two axes. This combination
of disciplines, producing
analytic geometry, strength-
ened both. Geometric prob-
lems could be solved
algebraically, and algebraic
equations could be illus-
trated geometrically.

It also laid the founda-
tion for the development of
the calculus, which is essen-
tially the application of al-
gebra to smoothly changing
phenomena that can be rep-
resented geometrically by
curves of various sorts.

Fermat’'s Last
Theorem

The French mathematician
Pierre de Fermat (1601 —
1665) had a bad habit of
not publishing but of scrib-
bling hasty notes in mar-
gins of books or of writing
casually about his discover-
ies in letters to his friends.
The result is that even
though he understood ana-
lytic geometry before Des-
cartes, he loses the credit.

Here is something that
involved him.

It is possible to have
two squares that add up to
a third square: 32 + 42 =
52,0r9 + 16 = 25. There
are an infinite number of
such cases. Are there, how-
ever, two cubes that add up
to a third cube, or two
fourth powers that add up
to a fourth power, and so on?
 

Fermat wrote in the
margin of a book that there

aren’t—it works anly for
squares, He had a perfectly

marvelous prool for i
said, but there was no room
in the margin to write it
down.

Now Fermat often said
he had a proof for some par-
ticular proposition, and in
every case, proofs have

1640

 

 

been overed for thosc
cases even when Fermat
didn't give his. In y

Coke

England’s forests were di-
minishing, and for that rea-
son the English were
turning to coal for fuel,
even though its fumes and
smoke were neither appetiz-
ing nor healthy

Wood was still needed
for charcoal, however (sec
1000 B.c.), which was used

in iron-smelting. Coal could
substitute for wood in heat
ing homes but could not
substitute for charcoval in
industry

If coal is subjected to

  

the same kind of incom-
plete burning as wood, how
ever, coal like wood will
burn ofl the noncarbon ms:
terial leaving virtually pure

carbon behind. The pure-

 

carbon residue of coal is
called coke (a word of un-

known derivation). It may

Cross Hairs

Although telescopes had
been in use for a generation
by now, they still left the
task of judging distances be-
tween stars to the naked
eye. They showed more
stars and they widened the
distance between them, but
the precision of measuring
that distance remained low.
The English astrono-

mer William Gascoigne
(1612?2—1644) invented a
simple solution. In 1641 he
placed fine cross hairs
where the image reached a
focus. A particular spot
could be located and accu-
rately centered at the cross-
ing point of the hairs and
the telescope then shifted
to a neighboring star, mak-
ing use of a device to mea-
sure how great an angle the

telescope had turned
through.

This began the conver-
sion of the telescope from a
mere viewing toy to an in-
strument of precision. How-
ever, Gascoigne was killed
in battle before he could
properly develop his discov-
ery. It was twenty years be-
fore cross hairs were
rediscovered and put to
general use in telescopes.

Quinine

The Incas had used the
bark of the cinchona tree as
a treatment for malaria.
The active ingredient in it
eventually came to be
known as quinine. The first
knowledge of quinine
reached Europe in 1642,
and for three centuries it re-
mained the only treatment
for this common and debili-
tating disease. Without qui-
nine, it is doubtful if
Europeans could have

long remained in tropical
climates.

Adding
Machine

In 1642 the French mathe-
matician Blaise Pascal
(1623-1662) invented a cal-
culating machine that
could add and subtract. It
had wheels that each had 1
to 10 marked off along its
circumference. When the
wheel at the right, repre-
senting units, made one
complete circle, it engaged
the wheel to its left, repre-
senting tens, and moved it
forward one notch.

With such a machine,
as long as the correct num-
bers were entered into the

device, there was no possi-
bility of a mistake,

He patented the final
version in 1649, but it was
a commercial failure. It
was too expensive, and
most people continued to
add and subtract on their
fingers, on an abacus, or on
a sheet of paper.

South Pacific

The ancient Greeks had
thought there might be a
large continent in the south-
ern hemisphere to balance
the land they knew in the
northern hemisphere. This
was pure speculation, but
the later Europeans took
Greek speculation seri-
ously.

Both South America
and Africa extended into
the southern hemisphere,
but they didn't seem to ful-
fill the requirements. There
ought to be a continent that
was entirely in the south-
ern hemisphere. The Pacific
Ocean was clearly vast, cov-
ering nearly half the area of
the globe. Since Magellan
had first entered it (sec
1523), no significant land
area had been found, but lit-
tle of it had as yet been ex-
plored.

The Indonesian islands,

which straddled the Equa-
tor, seemed a good place to
start. In 1606 a Spanish
navigator, Luis Vaez de Tor-
res (fl. 1606), sailed all
around the island of New
Guinea and showed that it
was not part of a continen-
tal landmass. It proved to
be the second-largest island
in the world. The narrow
stretch of water south of
New Guinea is called Torres
Strair in the explorer’s
honor.

When the Dutch be-
came dominant in the Indo-
nesian islands, the Dutch
governor-general Anthony
van Diemen (1593-1645)
sent out an exploring expe-
dition under Abel Janszoon
Tasman (1603?-1659).

On August 14, 1641,
Tasman left the island of
Java and for ten months
sailed the Pacific. He dis-
covered an island he named
Van Diemen’s Land, in
honor of his chief, but it is
now known as Tasmania in
his own honor. He also dis-
covered the southern island
of what is now known as
New Zealand.

The astonishing thing
about Torres's and Tas-
man’s voyages is that nei-
ther managed to spot
Australia, a picce of land as
large as the United States
New Guinea is only 100
miles from northeastern
Australia, and Tasmania is
only 230 miles from south-

eastern Australia, but both
somehow managed to miss
it.

 

In 1644 Tasman did fi-
nally spot a portion of the

Australian coast and called
it New Holland, but he
didn't explore it further.

 

1643

 

Barometer

It had long troubled mining
engineers and others that
pumps could not lift water
more than 33 feet above its
natural level. The usual
pump produced a partial
vacuum, which the water
rushed upward to fill, but
apparently the rush had its
limits. The Italian physicist
Evangelista Torricelli
(1608—-1647) worked for
Galileo in that scientist's
last years, and Galileo sug-
sted that his assistant in-
vestigate this pumping
problem.

It occurred to Torricelli
that the water was lifted
not because it was pulled

   

up by the vacuum, but be-
cause it was pushed up by
the normal pressure of air,
After all, the vacuum in the
pump produced a low air
pressure and the normal air
outside the pump pushed
harder

In 1643, to check this
theory, Torricelli made use
of mercury. Since mer-
cury'’s density is 13.5 times
that of water, air should be
able to lift it only Y135 times
as high as water, or 30
inches. Torricelli filled a
6-foot length of glass tubing
with mercury, stoppered
the open end, upended it in
a dish of mercury, un-
stoppered it, and found the
mercury pouring out of the

 

 

tube, but not altogether:
30 inches of mercury re-
mained in the tube, as
expected.

Above the mercury in
the upended tube was a
vacuum (except for a small
quantity of mercury vapor).
It was the first one ever arti-
ficially created—a Torricel-
lian vacuum.

Torricelli noticed that
the height of the mercury
column varied slightly
from day to day and sur-
mised correctly that the
atmosphere possessed a
slightly different pressure
at different times. He had
invented the first barome-
ter
Once Torricelli had pro-
duced a vacuum t
allow

t of a tube (see 1643),
it seemed to some that
vacuums could be pre

to pour

duced in more direct ways.
Perhaps air could simply be
pumped out of any vessel,
and larger volumes of vac-
uum could be formed than
Torricelli had managed.

A German phy
Otto von Guericke (1602—

luced the first
ir pump in 164

pump but with pa
ciently well fitted to be r
sonably airti

suericke produced a

large enough vacuum to

show that a ringing bell
within a vacuum could not
be heard, thus bearing out
Aristotle’s contention that

Air Pressure
and Altitude

If the mercury column of
Torricelli's barometer (see
1643) were held up by air
pressure, then if one went
up high in the air, there
should be less air above,
and the air pressure should
decrease. Therefore, so
should the height of the
mercury column.

To test this, Pascal (see
1642) sent his brother-in-
law up a neighboring moun-
tain with a couple of barom-
eters. His brother-in-law
climbed about a mile and
found that the mercury col-
umns had dropped from 30
to 27 inches.

This showed clearly

that the atmosphere could
only have a finite height. In
fact, if it were as dense
throughout as it was at sea
level, it would be only 5
miles in height.

Even when it became
apparent that air became
less dense with height, so
that quantities of it ex-
tended far higher than 5
miles, there had to be lim-
its. At a height of 100 miles
or so, air would be so thin
that it might as well be vac-
uum, and so for all the rest
of the distance to the Moon
and to other heavenly bod-
ies.

Experiments like those
of Torricelli and Pascal’s
brother-in-law amounted
to the discovery of outer

space.

Fluid Pressure

About 1648, Pascal also
studied fluid pressure by ex-
erting pressure on water
and noting how that pres-
sure was transmitted
against the walls of a
closed vessel. He concluded
that when pressure is ex-
erted on a fluid in a closed
vessel, it is transmitted un-
diminished throughout the
fluid and that it pushes at
right angles to all surfaces
that it touches. This is
called Pascal’s principle and
is the basis of the hydraulic
press.

Double Stars

In 1650 the Italian astrono-
mer Giambattista Riccioli
(1598—-1671) observed, tele-
scopically, that Mizar, the
middle star of the handle of
the Big Dipper, was actu-
ally two stars so close to-
gether that they could not
be seen as separate with the
unaided eye. This was the
first double star to be de-
tected.

Age of the Earth

Of the written materials
available to Europeans at
this time, the Bible was the

1651

only one that claimed to
give the history of Earth
from the creation, and it
was generally accepted by
all scientists as the authori-
tative word of God at this
time and for two more cen-
turies. (Many people accept
it as such to this day.)

The Bible does not use
any acceptable chronology
for its early history, but by
following back from the
reign of King Saul and mak-
ing use of hints here and
there in the earlier histori-
cal sections, it is possible to
decide what the biblical
date of the creation might
have been.

In 1650 James Ussher
(1581-1656), an Anglican
bishop, worked out the d

  

of the creation in this wa
and decided it had taken
place in 4004 B.c. Four
years later an English theo
logian, John Lightfoot
(1602—1675), sharpened the
date and made it 9 a.m
October 26, 4004 B.c

Such dating of creation
has no valid basis what-
ever, but it has strongly in-
fluenced popular opinion to
the present day.

 

 

Names on
the Moon

In 1651 Riccioli (see 1650,
Double Stars) published Al-
magestunt Novunt (New Al-
magest). The reference to

Ptolemy’s old book (see
140) was not accidental, for
Riccioli rejected heliocen-
tricity and insisted on an
Earth-centered astronomy
a full century after Coperni-
cus's book had been pub-

lished.

The book, however, in-
cluded a map of the Moon
with names given to the

various craters. Riccioli

  

began the habit of naming
surface features on other
worlds after astronomical

notables, and many of his
0o

names are still used. Of
course, he gave the most
conspicuous crater on the

Moon the name of Tycho,
whom he admired extrava-
gantly. Another large one

was Prolemaeus. Copernicus
is a pretty notable crater,
and Kepler is not bad either.

 

1653

 

Lymphatics

Veins and arteries had been
known since Greek times,
but in 1653 a third set of
vessels was discovered. The
Swedish naturalist Olof
Rudbeck (1630-1702) dem-
onstrated their existence in

a dog. These new vessels re-
sembled veins but had thin-
ner walls and carried the
clear watery fluid portion
of the blood (lymph), so that
the vessels were called lym-
phatics.
The lymph is forced
out of the smallest blood

vessels and into the spaces
around the cells, forming
the interstitial fluid. This
drains into the lymphatics
and is carried back into the
blood vessels in various
parts of the body.

 

1654

 

Probability

People much given to gam-
bling usually manage to
work out rough-and-ready

ways of measuring the like-
lihood of certain situations
so as to know which way to
bet their money, and how
much, If they did not do

this, they would quickly
lose all their money to
those who did.

A certain French gam-
bler, Chevalier de Mere
 

(1610-1685), was puzzled
at the fact that he kept los-
ing money in a certain
game of dice, which he felt
he ought to win. In 1654 he
consulted Pascal (see 1642)
on the matter, who in turn
consulted Fermat (see
1637). Pascal and Fermat
worked out mathematical
techniques for judging the
likelihood of certain combi-
nations appearing in the
fall of (honest) dice. In
doing so, they laid the foun-
dations for the theory of
probability.

The chief function of
probability was to deal
with large numbers of
events, which singly were
random in nature but in
total were predictable. As
time went on, considera-
tions of probability proved

1656

to be almost inconceivably
important in the develop-
ment of science.

Air Pressure

Guericke, having invented
the air pump (see 1645),
used it to demonstrate the
power of air pressure, be-
ginning in 1654.

For instance, he affixed
a rope to a piston and had
fifty men pull on the rope
while he slowly created a
vacuum on the other side of
the piston within the cylin-
der. Air pressure inexorably
pushed the piston into the
cylinder despite the strug-
gles of the fifty men to pre-
vent it.

Then he prepared two
metal hemispheres that fit-
ted together along a

10

greased flange. (They were
called Magdeburg hemi-
spheres because Guericke
was mayor of Magdeburg.)
When the hemispheres
were put together and the
air within them evacuated,
air pressure held them to-
gether even though teams
of horses were attached to
the separate hemispheres,
straining to their utmost in
opposite directions. When
air was allowed to enter the
joined hemispheres, they
fell apart of themselves.
This demonstration
took place before the eyes
of Ferdinand IIT (1608—
1657), who became Holy
Roman Emperor in 1637.
He was so impressed, he or-
dered Guericke's work to be
written up and published.

 

Saturn’s Ring

Galileo had observed Sa-
turn through his telescope
in 1612 and noted some-
thing odd about it. There
seemed to be projections on
either side. He could not
quite make them out, and
after a while they disap-
peared. It annoyed Galileo.
After all, he had been at-
tacked by religionists who
said that his telescope pro-
duced optical illusions, and
here was one case where

perhaps it did. He refused
to look at Saturn again.

In 1655, however, the
Dutch astronomer Chris-
tiaan Huygens (1629-1695),
with the help of a Dutch
philosopher and optician,
Benedict Spinoza (1632—
1677), worked out a new
and better method for
grinding lenses. He in-
stalled his improved lenses
in a telescope that was 23
feet long, and with that he
studied Saturn in 1656.

He could see what it

was that had puzzled Gali-
leo. Saturn was surrounded
by a thin, broad ring that
did not touch the planet at
any point. No other object
in the sky had so peculiar a
structure, and Saturn is
widely considered the most
beautiful object in the sky
because of it.

In addition, he discov-
ered that Saturn had a sal-
ellite, which he named
Titan (because Saturn, or
Cronos as the Greeks called
him, was the leader of a
group of gods called
Titans).

That same year, he dis-

covered that the middle
star of Orion’s sword was
not a star but a cloud of
luminous gas. It is now
known as the Orion nebula.

Pendulum
Clock

Up to this time, the best
timepieces were still the
mechanical clocks of medi-
eval days that could not
keep time to better than a
large fraction of an hour.

Galileo's discovery of
the principle of the pendu-
lum did not help immedi-
ately. An ordinary
pendulum swings in the arc
of a circle, and when it does
that it doesn’t have a con-
stant period. The period be-
comes a little longer
through a wide arc than
through a narrow one.

If the pendulum could
swing through a cycloid
(very like a circle over a
small arc), then the period
would remain truly con-
stant, Huygens (see above)
showed how to arrange
matters so that the pendu-

lum would swing through a
cycloid. He then hooked it
up to falling weights in
such a way that the pendu-
lum controlled the rate at
which the weights fell and
made it truly constant.

In 1656 Huygens had
the first pendulum clock (or
as it is sometimes called,
grandfather's clock). 1t was
the first timepiece that
could tell time to a minute
or better and was the first
accurate enough to be use-
ful to scientists.

 

1657

 

Falling Bodies

Galileo was quite satisfied
that all bodies fell at equal
rates, provided that air re-
sistance didn’t complicate
matters. If objects fell
through a vacuum, then
there would be no resis-

tance, and if this could be
observed, the question
could be settled directly in-
stead of by inference.

The English physicist
Robert Hooke (1635—1701)
designed an air pump that
worked better and more
quickly than Guericke's

(see 1645). When Hooke
had a good vacuum in a
large jar, he arranged for a
feather and a coin to be re-
leased from the top of the
jar at the same time, and
behold, they dropped at the
same speed.
 

1658

 

Red Blood
Corpuscles

Microscopes of sorts had
been in existence for half a
century, but they had not
been very good. They mag-
nified but slightly and were
usually not perfectly in
focus. It was not till the
1650s that microscopes im-

proved in quality to the
point where they were use-
ful in studying the minu-
tiae of living things.

The Dutch naturalist
Jan Swammerdam (1637-
1680) studied insects under
the microscope and col-
lected some three thousand
species of them, so that he
is considered the father of
modern entomology

Swammerdam'’s most
famous discovery, however,
made in 1658, was the red
blood corpuscle. Present in
the bloodstream in the bil-
lions, red blood corpuscles
carry the chemical that ab-
sorbs oxygen from the air
in the lungs, though this
was not known till much
later.

The telescope, in con-
verting planets from points
of light to small orbs, made
it possible to see markings
on some of them.

Venus, which at times

approaches Earth more
closely than any other
planet, remained feature-
less, because it seemed to
have a heavy cloud layer.
Mars, next closest, was
different. In 1659, Huygens
(see 1656, Saturn’s Ring)

made out a dark, triangular
marking he called Syrtis
Major (large bog). It wasn't
a bog any more than the
Moon's “seas” were seas,
but it was one marking that
future astronomers contin-

 

ued to see.

Capillaries

Harvey's discovery of the
circulation of the blood (see
1628) had an important
flaw. According to Harvey,
the blood traveled from the
heart through the arteries,
into the veins, and back to
the heart. But how did the
blood get from the arteries
to the veins? There was no
visible connection, and Har-
vey was forced to maintain
that the connection con-
sisted of blood vessels that
were too small to see.

The microscope was
now an important tool,
however, and a pioneer in
this field was the Italian
physiologist Marcello Mal-
pighi (1628—-1694). The thin
wing-membranes of the bat
contained what was virtu-
ally a two-dimensional net-
work of blood vessels.
Malpighi studied it under
the microscope in 1660 and
saw the tiniest arteries and

veins connected by vessels
too small to see without the
microscope. He called the
tiny vessels capillaries, from
a Latin word meaning
""hair-like.” Harvey's theory
was complete, but Harvey
hadn’t lived to see it. He
had died three years before.

Static Electricity

When Thales (see 585 B.c.)
studied the magnetic prop-
erties of loadstone, he is
also supposed to have stud-
ied amber, which, when
rubbed, attracts light ob-
jects. Whereas magnets at-
tract only iron, rubbed
amber attracts many
things.

William Gilbert, who
showed that Earth was a
magnet (see 1600), found
that rock crystal and a vari-
ety of gems showed the
same attractive force when
rubbed that amber did.

Since the Greek word for

amber was elektron, Gilbert
called these substances elec-
trics, and the phenomenon
came to be called electricity.
Because the electricity in
electrics seemed to stay put
if left undisturbed, it was
referred to eventually as
static electricity, from a
Greek word meaning “to
stand.”

The first to demon-
strate static electricity on a
large scale was Guericke,
who had invented the air
pump (see 1645). The elec-
trical phenomenon was pro-
duced by rubbing, and
Guericke in 1660 fashioned
a globe of sulfur that could
be rotated on a crank-
turned shaft. When it was
stroked with the hand as it
rotated, it accumulated
quite a lot of static electric-
ity. It could be discharged
and recharged indefinitely,
and Guericke could pro-
duce sparks from his electri-
fied globe.

Chemical
Elements

It had been just about two
thousand years now since
Aristotle listed the four ele-
ments (earth, water, air,
and fire) that made up the
Earth and a fifth (aether)
that made up the heavenly
bodies. That still remained
the dominant theory, al-
though some alchemists
had considered mercury,
sulfur, and salt to be partic-
ularly important.

But the day of alchemy
was over. The Irish-born
physicist and chemist Rob-
ert Boyle (1627-1691) pub-
lished a book in 1661 that
was called The Skeptical
Chymist, and as a result,
the very name alchemist
was changed to chemist.
The dropping of the prefix
al-, which is the Arabic rhe,
seemed somehow to sym-
bolize turning the back on
medievalism. In this book,
Boyle also divorced chemis-
try from medicine and
made it a separate science.

Boyle’s most important
feat was to push chemistry
in the direction of becom-
ing an experimental sci-
ence. He wanted chemical
elements to be established
by experimentation rather
than by deduction.

He pointed out that an
element was one of the sim-
ple components of the
Earth, one that could not
be converted into anything
simpler. Therefore, any-
thing that couldn’t be con-
verted into anything
simpler was an element,
while anything that could
be so converted was not.
The only way you could dif-
ferentiate an element from
a nonelement, then, was to
try hard to make a sub-
stance simpler.

Acid-Base
Balance

Hippocrates (see 420 B.c.)
had maintained that health
was preserved by the
proper balance of the four
humors (blood, phlegm,

bile, and black bile), and
this idea had also lasted

two thousand years, like

the four elements of Aris-
totle.

The Dutch physician
Franz Deleboe (1614-1672),
better known by the Latin-
ized name Franciscus Syl-
vius, denounced the four-
humor theory in 1661 and
suggested instead that
health depended on the bal-
ance of acids and bases in
the body. This was cer-
tainly an improvement on
the older view.

Sylvius also studied di-
gestive juices such as saliva
and suggested that diges-
tion was a chemical process
(fermentation) rather than
a mechanical one (grind-
ing). In this, he was quite
right.

 
 

 

1662

 

Boyle’s Law

As Boyle experimented
with vacuums, it was he
who employed Robert
Hooke to build an im-
proved air pump (see 1657).

The air pump got Boyle
interested in gases, and in
1662 he discovered that air
could be compressed. He
did this by trapping some
air in the short closed end
of a J-shaped 17-foot-long
glass tube into which he
poured mercury to close off
the bottom curve.

If he next added more
mercury to the open end,
the weight of the additional
mercury squeezed the
trapped air in the closed
end more closely together,
and its volume decreased.
Indeed, Boyle found that
the volume of the gas var-
ied inversely with the pres-
sure upon it. That is, if he
doubled the weight of mer-
cury upon it, the volume
shrank to one-half the origi-
nal; if he tripled the weight

of mercury, the volume
shrank to one-third, and so
on. This is called Boyle's
Law.

The most important
conclusion of this experi-
ment was that air, and pre-
sumably other gases, were
atomic in nature and that
the atoms were widely
spread apart. With pres-
sure, the atoms were forced
more closely together and
the volume shrank.

Liquids and solids
could not be compressed
with the same ease that
gases could be, but that did
not necessarily mean they

weren't composed of atoms.

In their cases, the atoms
might already be in con-
tact.

The idea of atomism
had not entirely died out
since the time of Democri-
tus (see 440 B.c.). There had
always been a few from
time to time who accepted
atoms. Boyle's experi-
ments, however, were the
strongest evidence yet, and

Boyle himself became a
convinced atomist. It was
to be a century and a half,
however, before atomism
won out entirely.

Royal Society

There had been informal
meetings of scientists in
London in the mid-1600s,
and the habit grew more in-
grained after the Restora-
tion (of Charles 11, that is).
Like many monarchs of
his time, Charles II patron-
ized science as a way of
gaining prestige for the na-
tion and possibly material
benefit as well. He there-
fore gave a legal charter to
the Royal Society in 1662.
For years, it represented
the most brilliant assem-
blage of scientists since the
great days of Alexandria.
The Royal Society re-
ceived communications
from members, both at
home and abroad, and held
meetings where members
could inform one another of
their work. It also pub-
lished a journal called Phil-
osophical Transactions, in
which experimental work
and findings could be pub-

Cell

The use of the microscope
was now spreading rapidly
and one of the best of the
early microscopists was
Hooke (see 1657). In 1665
he published Micrographia,
which outlined his work in
this field. It had some of the
most beautiful drawings of
microscopic observations
ever made.

His most important dis-
covery (though it did not
seem so at the time, no
doubt) involved the struc-
ture of cork. Under the mi-
croscope, he found a thin
sliver of cork to be com-
posed of a finely serried pat-
tern of tiny rectangular
holes. These he called cells,
from a Latin word for
“small chamber” —espe-
cially one of the type that
exists in rows, as monas-
tery cells or prison cells do.

The cells that Hooke
observed were empty only
because they were found in
dead tissue. In living tissue
they are filled with fluid,
and that disqualifies them
from being called cells,
strictly speaking. The
name, however, clung,

Light Diffraction

It was about this time that
the question of waves ver-
sus particles began to

be raised, one that was

to be argued for a long
time.

Water waves could be
seen, and the fact that they
tended to curve around ob-
stacles could be considered
a characteristic of all
waves. Particles, on the
other hand, if moving in a
straight line, did not curve
around obstacles but either
struck and bounced back
(being reflected) or missed
and continued moving in a
straight line.

Since sound curved
around obstacles, it was
taken to be a wave phenom-
enon. Since light cast sharp
shadows, it was natural to
think of it as composed of
tiny particles.

An Italian physicist,
Francesco Maria Grimaldi
(1618-1663), made an ob-
servation that was pub-
lished posthumously in
1665. He had let a beam of
light pass through two nar-
row apertures, one behind
the other, and then fall on a
blank surface. He found
that the band of light on
that surface was a trifle
wider than the apertures.

He believed, therefore, that
the beam had been bent
slightly outward at the
edges of the aperture, a phe-
nomenon he called diffrac-
tion.

This would make it
seem that light was a wave
phenomenon.

But a wave's bending
about an obstacle depends
on the relative size of the
wave and the obstacle. Any
wave will be reflected by a
barrier considerably larger
than itself: water waves
will be reflected by a break-
water and sound waves will
be reflected by a cliff wall.
Since light waves were re-
flected from small objects,
and diffraction was only
very slight, it must follow
that if light were composed
of waves, they were very
small waves indeed.

However, Grimaldi's
work was largely neglected
and the controversy went
on for a century and a half
without reference to him.

Planetary
Rotations

The fact that features could
be made out on the surface
of some of the planets
meant that those features
could be observed from
night to night as they
passed around the planet to
the other side and across
the face again. By watching
long enough and dividing
the time elapsed by the
number of turns, an accu-
rate measure of the rota-
tion rate of the planet could
be obtained.

1666

 

In this way, in 1665,
the Italian-born French as-
tronomer Gian Domenico
Cassini (1625-1712) deter-
mined that Mars rotated in
24 hours 40 minutes, while
Jupiter rotated in 9 hours
56 minutes.

Since these planets ro-
tated on their axis as Earth

did, it made them seem
more like our ]"L’,Ikl As as
tronomical discoveries con-
tinued, Earth seemed less
and less a special case

 

cept insofar as we are here
on Earth and not anywhere
else.

 

 

Light Spectrum

The English scientist Isaac
Newton (1642—-1727), curi-
ous about light, conducted
a series of crucial experi-
ments in 1665 and 1666. He
allowed a beam of light to
pass through a prism (a tri-
angular piece of glass) and
then fall on a white wall.
What emerged was a
band of colors, the least
bent portion of the light
being red, and then follow-
ing, in order, orange, yel-
low, green, blue, and violet,

 

each merging gradually
into the next.

Were the colors pro-
duced by the glass? No, for
when Newton passed the
light that had emerged
from the prism through a
second prism oriented in
the opposite direction, all
he got was white light. The
colors had recombined.

This meant that light
had to be looked upon in a
totally new way. It had al-
ways been assumed that
white light was “pure”
light and that color was in-

troduced as an impurity
through the effect of mate-
rial substances on the light.

Newton’s work made it
clear that color was an in-
herent property of light and
that white light was a mix-
ture of different colors. Mat-
ter affected color only by
absorbing some kinds of
light and transmitting or re-
flecting others.

Exactly what it was

 

 

that made light assume dif-
ferent colors was not yet

clear, however.
 

1668

 

Conservation of
Momentum

In studying motion, it be-
came clear that motion
wasn't created out of noth-
ing. If some moving object
struck another object at
rest, it might well impart
motion to the second ob-
ject. (Anyone playing bil-
liards can see this.) Yet a
great deal of motion in a
light object would impart
only a small motion to a
heavy object. (Anyone kick-
ing a cannonball can see
this.)

Perhaps if one
multiplied the mass by the
velocity, it would be that
product that stayed the
same. The product of mass
and velocity is called mo-
mentum (from a Latin word
for “movement”). The En-
glish mathematician John
Wallis (1616—1703) was the
first to suggest, in 1668,
that the total momentum of
a closed system (one into
which no momentum from
the outside entered, and

from which no momentum
leaked into the outside) re-
mained always unchanged.
This is called the law of con-
servation of momentum.

Momentum can be
shifted from one part of a
system to another but can
neither be created nor de-
stroyed. Momentum can be
in either of two directions
—let us say, plus or minus.
If one starts off with no mo-
mentum at all in a closed
system, one part may start
moving in one direction
(the plus direction) if an-
other part starts moving in
the opposite (minus) direc-
tion. If the two momenta
(movements) are equal and
opposite, they cancel, and
the total momentum re-
mains zero. Similarly, if
two bodies come together
with equal and opposite
momenta (total, zero), they
can bounce off each other,
having switched the plus
and minus to some extent,
or they can stick together
and both be motionless (the
total always remaining
Zero).

Such a conservation
law explains a great many
things about motion that
would otherwise be puz-
zling. The law of conserva-
tion of momentum was the
first of the conservation
laws to be understood, but
others would, in time, fol-
low, and all are fundamen-
tal to our understanding of
the structure and function-
ing of the Universe.

Spontaneous
Generation

It has always been com-
monly supposed that some
forms of life can arise spon-
taneously from nonlife.
This has been especially so
in connection with life
forms that human beings
do not want—weeds and
vermin. Useful forms of life
require the utmost care,
but useless or harmful
forms seem to flourish de-
spite human effort to eradi-
cate them. It is tempting to
believe that these pests
arise out of nowhere. Be-
sides, there is the evidence
of the eyes. One can see
how maggots, for instance,
arise out of decaying meat.
The meat is dead but gives
rise to living maggots.
Spontaneous generation
seems unquestionable.

In 1668, however, the
Italian physician Francesco
Redi (1626—-1697) decided
to test the matter experi-
mentally.

He prepared eight
flasks with a variety of
meats in them. Four he
sealed and four he left open
to the air. Flies could land
only on the meat in the
open vessels, and only
those bred maggots. The
meat in the closed vessels
turned just as putrid—but
no maggots.

To test whether it was
the absence of fresh air that
did it, Redi repeated the ex-
periments without sealing
any flasks but covering four
with gauze instead. The air
was not excluded from the
gauze-covered flasks, but

 

flies were, and there were
no maggots in those flasks.

 

(This was the first clear-cut
case of the use of proper
controls in a biological ex-
periment.)

Redi concluded that
maggots did not arise by
spontaneous generation but
hatched [rom eggs laid by
flies, eggs too small to be
easily visible. This did not
settle the matter generally,
but it was difficult thereaf-
ter Lo believe that life forms
large enough to be visible
to the unaided eye arose by
spontaneous generation.

 

Reflecting
Telescopes

During the first sixty years
of the telescope’s use, its
lenses curved light by re-
fraction and focused it. In
this way, the eye saw the
image as brightened and ex-
panded. Such telescopes
were refracting telescopes.
Unfortunately, the
lenses refracted different
colors of light differently
and formed a spectrum, so
that the images in such tele-

scopes were always blurred
by colored rings, red or
blue (chromatic aberration).
This was minimized by
using only the center of the
lens and having the light
come together only g
ally and reach a [ocus
considerable distance from
the lens, but this meant
that telescopes capable of

  

considerable brightening
and enlargement had to be
long and unwieldy.

Newton, through his
experiments with light (see
1666), supposed that one
couldn’t possibly have a
lens without blurring the
image with color. He there-
fore thought of an alterna-
tive. Why not use curved
mirrors instead of curved
lenses, and focus the light
by reflection rather than re-
fraction? Reflection did not
produce a spectrum.

In 1668, therefore, he
built the first reflecting tele-
scope, and thereafter two

Calculus

In the years 1665—1666,
Newton (see 1666) was stay-
ing at his mother’s farm in
order to escape the London
plague. One evening he saw
an apple fall from a tree at
a time when the Moon was
shining peacefully over-
head and began to wonder
why the Moon didn't fall.
He then thought that per-
haps it did, but that it was
also moving horizontally
and fell at each moment
just enough to make up for
the curvature of the Earth.
Thus, the Moon fell forever
but only succeeded in mov-
ing around the Earth in one
of Kepler’s ellipses.
Newton spent consider-
able time trying to work
out how Earth might pull
at the Moon as it pulled at
the apple, and at what rate
the Moon might be falling,
but he was not satisfied
with his calculations and
put them to one side. Some
say it was because there
was no good determination
of the exact size of the
Earth at the time; others
say it was because he didn't
know how to allow for the
fact that every bit of Earth
was pulling at the Moon
from slightly different dis-

tances and angles. He
needed a mathematical tool
that would help him solve
that problem.

In 1669 he began work-
ing on such a tool, a mathe-
matical technique that
came to be called calculus.
This was a more versatile
technique than anything in-
vented earlier, and science
could not do without it
these days. Calculus is the
beginning of higher mathe-
matics.

Working on the calcu-
lus at roughly the same
time as Newton was a Ger-
man mathematician, Gott-
fried Wilhelm Leibniz
(1646—1716). Both he and
Newton worked out the
technique—Newton, per-
haps, a little sooner—but
Leibniz ended with a better
symbolism.

This is not unusual.
Frequently two scientists
working independently
come up with the same an-
swers in response to the
same problems. Often the
solution is to give them
joint credit. Sometimes,
however, there are argu-
ments about which scien-
tist was really first, and
this may even degenerate
into accusations of plagia-
rism.

That is what happened
this time. Exacerbated by
national prejudices, En-
glish versus German, there
was a Homeric battle that
poisoned the scientific com-
munity for years without
ever settling anything.
Today, Newton and Leibniz
are given joint credit for
the caleulus.

Phosphorus

Of the substances chemists
now consider to be ele-
ments, nine were known to
the ancients. These in-
cluded seven metals: gold,
silver, copper, tin, iron,
lead, and mercury; and two
nonmetals: carbon and sul-
fur. Four more elements
were probably known and
were unmistakably de-
scribed by the medieval al-
chemists: arsenic,
antimony, bismuth, and
zinc. We do not know who
first discovered any of these
elements, or when.

The situation changed
when the German chemist
Hennig Brand (d. ca. 1692)
began searching for some-
thing that would enable
him to create gold. For
some reason, he thought he
would find it in urine. He
did not succeed in making
 

gold, but perhaps as early
as 1669, he obtained a
white waxy substance that
glowed faintly in the air
and which he therefore
called phosphorus (from
Greek words meaning
“light-bearer”’). The faint
glow was due to the sponta-
neous combustion of phos-
phorus in air.

All the ninety or so ele-
ments discovered after
1669 can be attributed to a
specific person and a spe-
cific time. Brand’s discov-
ery of phosphorus is the
first of which this can be
said.

Fossils

The word fossil is from a
Latin word meaning “to
dig.” At first anything that
could be dug out of the
earth was called a fossil.
The word came to be ap-
plied, however, to those
particular objects that were
dug up and that, although
made of rock, seemed re-
markably like remnants of
living things—bones and
teeth particularly. Agricola
(see 1556) had commented
on these over a century ear-
lier.

There were numerous
theories about these fossils.
Some thought them prac-

tice attempts by God to cre-
ate living things. Some
thought them failing at-
tempts of Satan to imitate
God. Some thought them
the remains of animals that
had drowned in Noah's
Flood.

In 1669, however, the
Danish geologist Nicolaus
Steno (1636—1686) main-
tained that they were the re-
mains of creatures that had
lived long ago and whose re-
mains had slowly petrified;
that is, been converted into
stone. This view gradually
prevailed, and fossils were
to be the most spectacular
(though far from being the
only) evidence in favor of bi-
ological evolution.

Double
Refraction

Sometimes a discovery is
s0 puzzling it must simply
be put aside until science
advances to the point
where an explanation is
possible.

Thus, in 1669 a Danish
physician, Erasmus Bar-
tholin (1625-1698), ob-
tained a transparent crystal
of a type now called Iceland
spar. Bartholin noted that
objects viewed through the
crystal appeared double. It

was as though some light
were refracted by the crys-
tal through one angle, with
the rest refracted through a
slightly different angle. The
phenomenon was therefore
called double refraction.

Bartholin further no-
ticed that when he rotated
the crystal, one of the im-
ages remained fixed and
the other revolved about it.

Bartholin could not ex-
plain these observations,
and neither could anyone
else. The observations had
to remain in suspended ani-
mation for a century and a
half until enough was
known about light for an ex-
planation to become possi-
ble.

Blood Color

It was clear that blood
went to the lungs to pick up
air, and it was suspected
that this must involve a
chemical change in the
blood. The first to notice ev-
idence to that effect was an
English physician, Richard
Lower (1631-1691). In 1669
he noted that dark blood
drawn from veins turned
bright red on contact with
air. The necessary details
concerning the change had
to wait another century,
however.

 
 

1670

 

Diabetes

Many communicable dis-
eases had been described
and differentiated, but
there are also diseases that
are not communicable.
These are the result of some
inborn deficiency of the
body, which may make it-
self evident from birth or
only later in life.

Of these, the most im-
portant is diabetes, a disor-

1671

der in which the patient is
unable to process sugar in
the normal way. Sugar in a
diabetic tends to accumu-
late in the blood and spill
over into the urine.

Some of the ancient
physicians may have been
aware that the urine of dia-
betics was sweet, where
normal urine was not. It
may be that flies collecting
about diabetic urine gave
the first hint.

It was the English phy-
sician Thomas Willis
(1621-1675) who in 1670
was the first modern to
point out the sweetness.
Naturally, recognizing and
understanding symptoms is
a step toward learning how
to treat a disease, but
where diabetes was con-
cerned the treatment didn’t
come for a century and a

half.

 

Saturn’s
Satellites

By now, six satellites were
known: four circling Jupi-
ter (Io, Europa, Ganymede,
and Callisto), one circling
Saturn (Titan), and, of
course, one circling Earth
(Moon). Huygens (see 1656),
in an uncharacteristic mo-

ment of mysticism, thought
that the six satellites
matched the six planets in
number (Mercury, Venus,
Earth, Mars, Jupiter, and
Saturn), which balanced
things, so that no further
satellite discoveries were to
be expected.

Cassini (see 1665) blew
that view to smithereens in
1671 when he discovered a

second satellite of Saturn,
which he named Iapetus.
Over the next thirteen
years he discovered three
more: Rhea, Dione, and
Tethys. These names are
those of Titans: Iapetus was
a brother of Saturn
(Cronos), while the other
three were among his sis-
ters.

Distance of
Mars

Nineteen centuries before,
Hipparchus had deter-
mined the distance to the
Moon (see 150 B.c.). Since
then, no further heavenly
distance had been deter-
mined accurately. The par-
allaxes of all other
heavenly bodies were far
too small to measure with
the unaided eye, and the
telescopes weren't quite
good enough to do the job.
However, Kepler's el-
liptical orbits and his three
laws of planetary motion
had made it possible to
build a model of the Solar
System in the proper pro-
portions. If any planetary
distance could be obtained,
then all the other distances
would be known too.
Cassini (see 1665) tack-

led the job. Thinking his
telescope might be good
enough if he viewed Mars
from two places sufficiently
far apart, he sent another
French astronomer, Jean
Richer (1630-1696), to Cay-
enne in French Guiana on
the northern shore of South
America.

In 1672 Cassini deter-
mined the position of Mars
against the stars as seen
from Paris and, using the
position of Mars as given in
reports from Cayenne,
worked out the parallax of
Mars. That gave him the
distance between Mars and
Earth at that time, and
from that he could calcu-
late the other distances of
the Solar System.

From his figures, he de-
termined that the Sun was
87,000,000 miles from the
Earth, as compared with
the 5,000,000-mile distance

that Aristarchus (see 280
B.C.) had estimated. Cas-
sini's estimate was 7 per-
cent too low, but for a first
try it was amazingly close.

For the first time, an
appropriate idea of the size
of the Solar System was ob-
tained. Even allowing for
the slightly low figure Cas-
sini had, it was clear that
the orbit of Saturn, which
was then the farthest
known planet, had to be
over 1,600,000,000 miles
across.

The stars must be far-
ther still. No one yet knew
how much farther the stars
must be, but Cassini gave
human beings the first
shocking realization of how
small they and their world
were compared to the Uni-
verse. There were other and
greater shocks yet to come.

Speed of light

At this time, nobody knew
how quickly light traveled.
Galileo (see 1581) had tried
to measure it by standing
on top of one hill and hav-
ing a friend stand on top of
another, each with dark lan-
terns. Galileo would reveal
the flame in his lantern and
at once his friend would re-
veal the flame in his. The
time it took between Gali-
leo’s sending the light and
seeing the return light
would be the time it took
light to make the round
trip. However, the time was
always the same, no matter
how far apart the hills
were, and Galileo realized
that he was just measuring

his friend’s reaction time
and gave up. Light obvi-
ously moved too swiftly for
its speed to be measured in
that way. (There were those
who thought it moved with
infinite speed.)

In 1675, however, a
Danish astronomer, Olaus
Roemer (1644—1710), was
carefully observing the mo-
tions of Jupiter’s satellites
from the Paris Observatory,
including the time when
they passed behind Jupiter
and were eclipsed. Cassini
(see 1665) had timed those
motions carefully and Roe-
mer was checking them. To
Roemer’s surprise, he
found that the eclipses
came progressively earlier
at those times of the year

when Earth was ap-
proaching Jupiter in its
orbit and progressively
later when Earth was reced-
ing from Jupiter.

Roemer supposed this
might be because light did
not travel at infinite speeds
but took longer to go from
Jupiter to Earth when
Earth was on the opposite
side of the Sun from Jupi-
ter, and less time when
Earth was on the same
side. From these time differ-
ences, Roemer calculated
that light must travel at a
speed of about 141,000
miles per second. This is
only about three-fourths of
its actual speed, but for a
first determination it's not
bad.

Microorganisms

Microscopists had be
looking at minute sections
of ordinary living organ-
isms for twenty years and
more, but a Dutch micros-
copist, Antoni van Leeu-
wenhoek (1632-1723), now
surpassed them all.
Whereas other micros-
copists used combinations

little less bright. Some as-
tronomers thought the ring

dark line running around
it, but the majority opinion
favored the possibility that
there were two separate

Southern Stars

Throughout history, from
the Sumerians onward, de-
tailed astronomical obser-
vation has been confined to
the northern hemisphere.
The north celestial pole is
high in the sky as seen from
Europe and the Middle
East, and the stars near it,
in their daily circle about
it, never dip below the hori-
zon.

On the other hand, the
south celestial pole, along
with the stars near it, are
never above the horizon as
seen from Europe.

As a result, the south-
ernmost sky remained un-
known to European
astronomers till the Age of
Exploration began. During
Magellan's voyage, when
they were off the shores of
southern South America,
the sailors saw two hazy
clouds that looked like de-
tached portions of the

 

Milky Way. They are called
the Magellanic Clouds to
. A bright star con-
figuration, the Southern
Cross, was also reported.
No systematic astro-
nomical observations of the
far southern skies were
made, however, until the
English astronomer Ed-
mond Halley (1656—1742)
traveled to the island of St.
Helena in the south Atlan-
tic Ocean. There he spent
two years, and despite bad
weather that severely lim-
ited astronomical observa-
tions, he returned in 1678
to publish a catalog of 341
southern stars that astrono-
mers had, until then,
known nothing about.

Light Waves

The particle-versus-waves
controversy grew sharper
Newton (see 1666) felt
that light consisted of parti-
ause there

 

 

cles, partly bec

was a vacuum between
Earth and Sun and he
didn’t see how a wave
could cross a gap where
there was nothing to wave.

Huygens (see 1656), on
the other hand, insisted
that light consisted of
waves of the same type as
sound (so-called longitudi-
nal waves, which wave in
and out in the same direc-
tion the waves are travel-
ing). As to what was
waving, Huygens supposed
that there was a very subtle
fluid in the vacuum of
space (this came to be re-
ferred to by Aristotle’s term
aether), which could not be
detected in any ordinary
way.

Neither Newton's parti-
cles nor Huygen's longitudi-
nal waves could explain
Bartholin’s observation of
double refraction nine
years before, but that was
ignored. The controversy
continued to rage.

 
1679

 

Pressure
Cookers

Sixteen centuries after
Hero had created a device
that whirled because of
steam pressure (see 50), the
first useful application of
steam was advanced.

In 1679 the French
physicist Denis Papin
(1647-21712) developed the
pressuire cooker, a vessel
with a tightly fitted lid in
which water was boiled
and the accumulated steam
created a pressure that
raised water’s boiling
point. At this higher tem-

perature, bones softened
and meat cooked faster
than usual. A safety valve
was included in case the
steam pressure got too
high. Papin cooked a meal
for the Royal Society in his
device and prepared one for
Charles I as well.

Muscles and
Bones

There has been a continu-
ing struggle between those
who feel that life is some-
thing fundamentally differ-
ent from nonlife and obeys
different laws of nature (vi-
talism), and those who be-
lieve that one set of natural
laws governs everything,

life and nonlife alike. Gener-
ally, over the last three cen-
turies, victory has come to
the latter group.

Thus, in 1680 the Ital-
ian physiologist Giovanni
Alfonso Borelli (1608—-1679)
posthumously published a
book, De Motu Animalium
(Concerning Animal Mo-
tion), in which he success-
fully explained muscular
action on a mechanical

basis, describing the ac-
tions of bones and muscles
in terms of a system of lev-
ers. The laws that applied
to inanimate levers also ap-
plied to our bone-muscle
systems. (Of course, the
bone-muscle action is one
of the simplest aspects of
life. Things got much more
difficult as scientists tried
to deal with the more com-
plex aspects of life.)
1681

 

Dodo

Mauritius is an island
about half again as large as
the state of Rhode Island,
located in the Indian Ocean
500 miles east of Madagas-
car. In 1598 the Dutch set-
tled it and named it after
Maurice of Nassau (see

1586). The Dutch stayed, on
and off, till 1710.

Mauritius had forms of
life that had evolved in iso-
lation and that were differ-
ent from forms elsewhere.
For example, there was the
dodo, a flightless pigeon,
larger than a turkey and
with a huge hooked bill. It

was harmless and unafraid
(hence its name, perhaps)
since there was nothing on
Mauritius to threaten it.
Once settlers arrived,
however, they and their do-
mestic animals began to
kill this inoffensive bird.
This continued until the
very last dodo died about
 

1680. Similar birds on
nearby islands were also
killed off. Now we have the
expression “dead as a
dodo.”

It is hard to believe,
nowadays, that such an un-
usual and interesting form

of life should have been
slaughtered so casually,
with no attempt made to
save a few, but it has hap-
pened over and over again.
It is one of the brighter as-
pects of recent history that
human bei are now des-

 

 

 

perately try to save vari-

 

ous endangered species
though considering the in-
exorable increase in the
number of human beings
and the space they must oc-
cupy, this is often a losing
bat

Plant Sexuality

Before modern times,
plants were usually

thought to be not truly
alive in the sense that ani-
mals were. In the biblical
story of creation, plants
grow as soon as dry land ap-
pears. They seem to be part
of the land and meant only
for food. In contrast, on the

fifth and sixth days, God is
described as specifically
creating animal life and in-
structing it to multiply.
(Even today, vegetarians
announce that their love of
living things keeps them
from eating animal food, al-
though the plant life they
eat is every bit as alive.)
Some of this disdain
for plant life was broken

down, in 1682, by the En-
glish botanist Nehemiah
Grew (1641-1712), who
showed that plants repro-
duced sexually, that they
had sexual organs, and that
individual grains of pollen
were the equivalent of the
sperm cells of the animal'’s
world.

 
1683

 

Bacteria

In 1683 Leeuwenhoek (see
1676) made his most re-
markable discovery.
Through one of his little
lenses he saw what he

thought were living things
far smaller than his animal-
cules. They were just barely
at the limit of what he
could see in his lenses, and
it is a tribute to the excel-
lence of his grinding that

he saw what no one else
could see for another cen-
tury. In hindsight, we know
that what Leeuwenhoek
had discovered were bacte-
ria.

Size of the Earth

Eratosthenes’ figure for the
circumference of the Earth
(see 240 B.c.) had not been
bettered in a thousand
years.

In 1684, however, cer-
tain observations of the
‘ French astronomer Jean Pi-

card (1620-1682) were pub-
lished posthumously.
Instead of noting the dis-
tance of the Sun from the
zenith (the point in the sky
that is directly overhead) at
different places on the
Earth by measuring its
shadow, as Eratosthenes
had done, Picard measured

the distance of a star from
the zenith at different
places. With telescopes,
that was the more accurate
method, and Picard calcu-
lated the Earth's circumfer-
ence as 24,876 miles and its
diameter as 7,900 miles,
figures that are very close
to the best we have today.

Imaginary
Numbers

Mathematicians knew that
‘ the multiplication of two

negative numbers yields a
positive product. Thus, not
only does +1 x +1 = +1,
but -1 x —1 = +1. What
number, then, multiplied

by itself yields —1? To put

 

it another way, what is the
square root of —1?
Mathematicians can in-
vent the necessary number,
call it an imaginary number,
and symbolize it as i for
imaginary. You can then
say that +i X +i= —1.
What's more, —i X ~i
= —1.

Wallis (see 1668) suc-
ceeded in making sense out
of such imaginary numbers
in 1685.

Imagine a horizontal
line. Mark off a point as
zero and then imagine the
positive numbers marked
off to the right and the nega-
tive numbers marked off to
the left, with all the frac-
tions and irrational num-

bers appropriately marked
off between the whole num-
bers. That is the real num-
ber axis.

Next, draw a vertical
line passing through the
zero point. Mark all the i
numbers (i, 2i, 3i, and so
on) upward, and all the —i
numbers downward, with
all the imaginary fractions
and irrational numbers
marked off, too. That is the
imaginary number axis.

Every point in the
plane can then be marked

off just as Descartes did in
his analytical geometry (see
1637). Every point (a) on
the real number axis be-
comes a + 0i; every point
(b) on the imaginary num-
ber axis becomes 0 + bi;
and every number on nei-
ther axis (the complex num-
bers) becomes a + bi.

Such a scheme proved
enormously useful to math-
ematicians, scientists, and
engineers.

 

1686

 

Meteorological
Map

The wind often seems to be
totally unruly and unpre-
dictable, but even the an-
cient Romans knew that it
blew from Africa to India
for six months and then in
the other direction for six
months. These seasonal
winds were called mon-

soons, from an Arabic word
meaning ‘‘season.” There
were also the steady trade
winds that blew southwest-
ward north of the equator
and northwestward south
of the equator.

The first person to try
to make world sense out of
the winds was Halley (see
1678), who in 1686 wrote a
book on the subject. It in-
cluded a world map that

showed the prevailing
winds over the tropic
oceans—the monsoons and
trade winds. Halley did not
have quite the proper expla-
nation for the winds, how-
ever. He knew they
involved the rising of sun-
heated air but did not un-
derstand the reason for the
westward flow of tropical
air.
Plant
Classification

There is a natural tendency
for people interested in nat-
ural history to classify ani-
mals and plants. Aristotle
(see 350 B.c., Animal Classi-
fication) classified the for-
mer, and Theophrastus (see
320 B.c.) classified the lat-
ter. The ancients, however,

had limited access to living
things because so much of
the world was beyond their
ken.

The first to do a mod-
ern job of classification was
an English naturalist, John
Ray (1627-1705). Starting
in 1686, he published what
eventually came to be a
painstaking three-volume
classification of 18,600 dif-
ferent plant species. While

such work might seem to
be mere listing, the basis
for the classification re-
quires a good deal of inge-
nuity, and on the whole,
Ray made good decisions in
these matters. Classifica-
tions such as his made the
matter of biological evolu-
tion seem an overwhelming

likelihood

 

1687

 

Laws of Motion

In the nearly eighty years
since Kepler had come up
with the elliptical orbits of
the planets (see 1609), scien-
tists had been trying to
work out what it was that
kept the planets in their or-
bits and made the orbits el-
lipses. It was clear that the
Sun had to attract the plan-
ets somehow, but what was
the attraction and how did
it work?

A number of scientists
got pretty close to what

turned out to be the truth,
notably Hooke (see 1657),
who was a great enemy of
Newton (see 1666). When
Hooke boasted to Halley
(see 1678), who was a great
friend of Newton, that he
(Hooke) had the answer.
Halley went to Newton to
check the matter with him.
Newton said that he had
worked out the answer in
1666 (see 1669, Calculus)
but had never published it.
Halley, in great excitement
urged publication.

Newton could do this

 

now with much greater con-
fidence than he could have
done it twenty years ear-
lier. For one thing, he now
had calculus, which made
some calculations easy that
would have been difficult
before. For another, he had
Picard’s figures on the
Earth's size (see 1684), and
accuracy in that respect
was necessary to his calcu-
lations.

Newton took eighteen
months to write the bock
and, in 1687, published Phi-
losophiae Naturalis Prin-
 

 

 

 

cipia Mathematica
(Mathematical Principles of
Natural Philosophy), often
known simply as the Prin-
cipia. It was written in
Latin and did not appear in
English until 1729.Tt is gen-
erally considered the great-
est science book ever
written.

Despite the greatness
of the book, Newton had
trouble publishing it.
Hooke was unalterably op-
posed, and the Royal Soci-
ety hesitated to become
involved in the controversy.
Fortunately, Halley had in-
herited a fortune in 1684,
when his father was mur-
dered by unknown assail-
ants. He saw to the
proofreading of the book
and had it published at his
OWN expense.

In the book, Newton
codified Galileo’s findings
concerning falling bodies
(see 1589) into the three
laws of motion.

The first enunciated
the principle of inertia: A
body at rest remains at rest
and a body in motion
remains in motion at a con-
stant velocity (that is, con-
stant speed in a constant di-
rection) as long as outside
forces are not involved.

The second law of mo-
tion defines force as the
product of mass and accel-
eration. This was the first
clear distinction between
the mass of a body (repre-
senting its resistance to ac-

celeration) and its weight
(representing the extent to
which it is acted on by a
gravitational force),

The third law of mo-
tion states that for every ac-
tion there is an equal and
opposite reaction.

These laws of motion
are equivalent to the
axioms and postulates with
which Euclid began his
treatment of geometry,
From the axioms and postu-
lates, an incredible number
of theorems can be derived,
each one building on theo-
rems that went before. In
the same way, from the
laws of motion, an enor-
mous number of mechani-
cal effects can be deduced.

Universal
Gravitation

From the laws of motion,
Newton was able to deduce
the manner in which the
gravitational force of at-
traction between the Earth
and the Moon could be cal-
culated. He showed that it
was directly proportional
to the product of the
masses of the two bodies
and inversely proportional
to the square of the dis-
tance between their cen-
ters. The proportionality
could be made an equality
by the introduction of a con-
stant. In other words:

F = gmm'/d?
where g is the gravitational

constant, m and m' are the
masses of the Earth and the
Moon, d is the distance be-
tween their centers, and F
is the force of gravitational
attraction between them.
Most important of all,
Newton postulated that
this law of gravitational at-
traction held not only be-
tween the Earth and the
Moon, but between any two
bodies at all throughout the
Universe. It was not merely
gravitation he was speak-
ing of, but universal gravita-
tion. This was another
claim that the laws of na-
ture were the same every-
where and the mightiest
blow yet against the view
that the heavenly bodies
worked by some set of natu-
ral laws other than those
that prevailed on Earth.
From this rather sim-
ple law of universal gravita-
tion, all of Kepler’s laws of
planetary motion could be
derived. It accounted for all
the irregularities of plane-
tary motion known in New-
ton'’s time, for while the
Sun was the predominant
attractive body, the planets
had minor attractions for
each other that resulted in
slight alterations (perturba-
tions) of their orbits from
what they would be if the
Sun alone were involved.
What Newton had done
was to describe the machin-
ery of the Universe effec-
tively and to show that it
was essentially simple. De-
 

spite the fact that forces
other than gravitation are
known today, and that
Newton’s description of
gravitation has been re-
fined since, it still remains
true that gravitation is the
overriding force that con-
trols the great sweeps of
the Universe, and that New-
ton’s formulation is an ex-
cellent one if distances and
velocities are not too great.

Shape of the
Earth

In the Principia, Newton re-
ferred to Richer’s expedi-
tion to Cayenne, in French
Guiana, which helped de-
termine the parallax of
Mars (see 1672). While
there, Richer had found
that a pendulum beat more
slowly than it did in Paris,
so that a clock that would

1688

have been correct in Paris
lost two and a half minutes
a day in Cayenne.

Newton pointed out
that this could be so if the
force of gravity were
slightly weaker in Cayenne
than in Paris or if Cayenne
were farther from the
Earth’s center than Paris
was. Since Cayenne, like
Paris, was at sea level, the
conclusion was that sea
level must itself be higher
at Cayenne than at Paris.

Newton showed that if
a body rotated, a centrifu-
gal effect would act to
counter gravitation to a cer-
tain extent and that this
countering force would be
zero at the poles and grow
stronger and stronger as
one moved away from the
poles until it reached a
maximum at the Equator.
The centrifugal effect
would, in other words, give

rise to an equatorial bulge,
which would make the di-
ameter across the Equator
somewhat longer than the
diameter from pole to pole

Jupiter and Saturn,
which are much larger than
Earth, spin much faster
and are, in addition, made
of lighter material. In their
cases, the equatorial bulges
are so great that their orbs
look clearly elliptical
rather than circular.
Earth’s outline drawn from
pole to pole and back
would also be slightly ellip-
tical (though not noticeably
so to the unaided eye). In-
stead of being almost per-
fectly spherical as the Sun
and Moon are, Earth would
be an oblate spheroid ac-
cording to Newton's reason-
ing. (Of course, the matter
would have to be checked
by actual measurement
eventually.)

Calculating
Machines

Leibniz (see 1669, Calculus)
devised a calculating ma-
chine in 1693 that went be-
yond Pascal’s (see 164
Whereas Pascal’s could
only add and subtract, Leib-
niz's could multiply by au-
tomatically repeating
addition, and divide by au-
tomatically repeating sub-
traction. Leibniz also
invented a mechanical aid
to the calculation of trigo-
nometric and astronomical
tables.

This showed much
more clearly than Pascal’s
evice did that arithmeti-
| manipulations followed
simple rules and repeti-
s and by no means re-

power of the human brain.

Miner’s Friend

England, short of wood,
turned increasingly to coal,
but coal mines in England’s
damp climate tended to fill
with water, and the water
had to be pumped out at
the cost of much labor, in
volving both human and an-
imal muscle.

An English engineer,
Thomas Savery (1650?—
1715), knew of the power of
the vacuum as demon-
strated by Guericke (see
1645). It occurred to him
that one could create a
vacuum by filling a vessel
with hot steam and then
cooling it so that the steam
turned to a few drops of
water. If the vessel were
connected to a tube reach-
ing down into the water at
the bottom of the mine, the
water could be sucked up
as much as 33 feet (see
1643). It could then be
blown out by more steam,
which would fill the vessel
—and be cooled again to

suck up another batch of
water.

Savery built such
pumps in 1698 and called
them the Miner's Friend. A
few even came to be used.
However, they made use of
high-pressure steam, and
the technology of the day
was not able to handle such
steam safely. Besides, it
took a great deal of fuel to
heat water to form the nec-
essary steam, and most of
the coal obtained with the
help of the Miner's Friend
had to be used in operating
the device.

Nevertheless, Savery's
pump got people to think-
ing about using steam
power, and much was to
come of that.

Scientific
Voyages

Voyages undertaken for ex-
ploration, settlement, or
trade might also produce
scientific knowledge as a

side effect, as Columbus’s
first voyage did when he
observed magnetic
declination (see 1492), or
Magellan’s when the Magel-
lanic Clouds were observed
(see 1678). In 1698, how-
ever, an ocean voyage was
undertaken, for the first
time, that was for the spe-
cific purpose of scientific in-
vestigation and nothing
more.

The ship was the Par-
amour Pink and it was
under the command of Hal-
ley (see 1678). He remained
at sea for two years, mea-
sured magnetic declina-
tions all over the world,
and prepared the first map
of the world showing the
wiggling lines of equal dec-
lination. He also did his
best to determine accurate
latitudes and longitudes for
the various ports he
stopped at.

Gas
Volume and
Temperature

icist Guil-

The French pt
laume Amontons (1663—

1705) devised an air ther-
mometer that was different
from Galileo’s (see 1592),
for it measured tempera-
ture by the change in gas
pressure rather than by the

change in gas volume. He
used the thermometer to
show that a liquid such as
water always boiled at the
same temperature. Thi
made it possible to use the
temperature at which
water boiled as a standard
reference.

With his new thermom-
eter, Amontons tested the
volume of a fixed quantity
of gas at different tempera-

 

 

tures and, in 1 , showed
that the volume inc
at a steady rate as th
perature went up and de-
creased at the same steady
rate as the temperatur
went down. Much more im-
portant, he showed that for
he studied, the vol-
ume change with tempera-
ture was the same. It
seemed a property of all

gases.

Binary System

Our system of positional no-
tation for numbers is based
on ten, undoubtedly be-
cause we have ten fingers
on our two hands. There is,
however, nothing magic
about the figure 10. Instead
of units, tens, hundreds

(10 x 10s), thousands (10
X 10 x 10s), and so on, we
could have units, eights,
sixty-fours (8 x 8s), five-

hundred-twelves (8 x 8

X 8s), and so on, or ones,
seventeens, two-hundred-
eighty-nines (17 x 17s),
four-thousand-nine-
hundred-thirteens (17 x 17
% 17s), and so on—or any
number.

This was pointed out
by Leibniz (see 1669, Calcu-
lus) about 1700. Some
bases for positional nota-
tion are, of course, more
convenient than others.

Using the base 12 or 8 each
has some advantages over
10. Leibniz also showed
that the binary system
based on 2 had its uses. Its
positions were units, twos,
fours, eights, sixteens, and
s0 on. The only symbeols it
needed were 1 and 0. The
binary system is particu-
larly useful for modern
computers.
 

 

 

 

 

 

 

The Age of Reason (1701—-1780)

By the beginning of the
eighteenth century, science
had become separated from
theology, and investigation,
experimentation, and dis-
covery were the order of
the day. Society was in the
grip of a euphoria that
grew out of a widely held
confidence in the scientific
method, which became
identified with human prog-
ress. Public interest in
knowledge was strong
enough by mid-century to
support publication of
Denis Diderot’s Encyclope-
dia, a categorized summary
of information that was the
first of its kind. The design
of experiments was refined,
and both results and the
language used to report
them became more precise.
Greater emphasis was
placed on confirmation by
independent investigators;
the growth of the scientific
societies born in the 1600s
fostered the publication of
findings, discussion, and
general support for their
members’ work. Some of
the most stunning achieve-
ments of the period were in
chemistry. For his work es-
tablishing the importance
of quantitative measure-
ment, Antoine-Laurent La-
voisier is remembered as

the father of modern chem-
istry. In the 1770s, using re-
cent findings of Joseph
Priestley, Lavoisier deter-
mined that the newly iso-
lated gas oxygen was one of
two main components of
air and the key element in
combustion. Joseph Black’s
discovery of carbon dioxide
in 1754 had led to the real-
ization that air was a com-
bination of different gases,
and in 1766 Henry Caven-
dish isolated hydrogen and
determined that it had a
very low density. Other ele-
ments were discovered, in-
cluding cobalt, platinum,
nickel, manganese, chlo-
rine, and molybdenum. In
1735 Carolus Linneaus pub-
lished his Systems of Na-
ture, which classified
European plants (and, in
later editions, animals) so
skillfully that he is called
the father of modern taxon-
omy. A German botanist ex-
plained plant pollination
for the first time in 1763,
and a Dutch experimenter
discovered photosynthesis
in 1779.In 1729 Stephen
Gray, who thought that
electricity was a fluid,
showed that it could travel
through glass, twine, and
other conductors. Experi-
menters in 1745 were (liter-

ally) shocked to learn that
electricity could be stored
in what came to be called a
Leyden jar. In 1752 Benja-
min Franklin flew a kite in
a thunderstorm in a suc-
cessful attempt to prove
that natural electricity and
the electricity generated in
a Leyden jar were one and
the same. Several techno-
logical advances of this pe-
riod foreshadowed the
Industrial Revolution. The
flying shuttle, introduced in
1733, allowed partial mech-
anization of the weaving
process and greatly in-
creased the productivity of
textile workers. When Rich-
ard Arkwright devised the
spinning frame in 1769,
even unskilled workers
could produce woven cloth
much more quickly. In

1709 the process of iron-
smelting was improved
through the use of coke-
fired furnaces. In 1764
James Watt improved on
Newcomen's steam engine
of 1712 when he built a dou-
ble-chambered system, the
first such device that
worked reasonably well. It
was Watt's next improve-
ment on the steam engine
that took history into a radi-
cally new phase.
1705

 

Comets’ Orbits

For a century or more, as-
tronomers had been trying
to puzzle out the orbits of
comets. It was clear that
comets’ orbits were nothing
at all like those of the plan-
ets. Some astronomers
thought comets’ passed
through the Solar System
in a straight line. Others
thought they passed
through in parabolas—
coming in from far-off
space, going around the
Sun and out forever.

Once Newton's Prin-
cipia was published, how-
ever (see 1687), it seemed to
many that comets had to be
bound by gravitation as the
planets were.

Halley (see 1678), in an
attempt to prove that this
was so, began collecting
data on comets. Eventually,
when he had listed the
movements of two dozen
comets, he was struck by
the similarity of the path

across the sky of the 1682
comet (which he himself
had observed) with the
paths of the comets that
had appeared in 1607,
1531, and 1456. These four
had come at intervals of
seventy-five or seventy-six
years. It seemed to Halley
that it must be the same
comet, returning regularly.

If that were so, a comet
would have an orbit that
was an ellipse, just as
Earth'’s orbit was, but the
cometary ellipse would be
extremely elongated. At one
end, the comet would ap-
proach close to the Sun; at
the other, it would recede
far beyond Saturn, the far-
thest known planet.

Halley predicted, in a
book written in 1705, that
this same comet would re-
turn about 1758 and that it
would cross the sky in the
same path as in 1682. He
was aware, he said, that the
gravitational influence of
the planets might alter the

orbit somewhat and change
the time of appearance a lit-
tle.

Halley's claim was not
taken seriously at the time,
but it did rouse additional
interest in comets.

Plant
Nourishment

The English physiologist
Stephen Hales (1677-1761)
began experiments on
plants in 1705. His most im-
portant suggestion was that
air contributed to the nour-
ishment of plants, thus cor-
recting Helmont's
misconception of a century
before to the effect that
only water counted (see
1624).

Hales was the first per-
son to collect gases by bub-
bling them through water
and trapping them in an
upside-down vessel.

Carriage

.
Springs
All conveyances, from
sedan chairs to carriages,
were subject to the uneven-
nesses of the road, jolting
passengers as every projec-
tion or rut was encoun-
tered. It was not till 1706
that springs were used in
carriages to absorb some of
the shock. To be sure, this
induced swaying, which
has its unpleasantness, too,
but is undoubtedly prefera-

1707

ble to the lurchings and
bangings that existed be-
fore springs. The devising
of ever-more-efficient
springs and, just as im-
portant, smoother roads
gave land transportation
less the feeling of being a
devil’s playground.

Static Electricity

Guericke's ball of sulfur
(see 1660) was not an ex-
tremely efficient static-
electricity generator. In
1706, however, the English

physicist Francis Hauksbee
(ca. 1666—1713) con-
structed a glass sphere
turned by a crank, which,
through friction, could
build up a more intense
electric charge than sulfur
could. This greatly stimu-
lated further experimenta-
tion with static electricity.

 

Pulse Watch

With the development of
the pendulum clock by Huy-
gens (see 1656) and the hair-

and watches, but second
hands had not yet come in,
Then in 1707, the En-
glish physician John Floyer
(1649—1734) devised a pulse

spring by Hooke,
timepieces could tell time
to the nearest minute. By
the late 1600s, minute
hands were added to clocks
watch, which after winding
would run for a minute ex-
actly. One could thus count

the number of heartbeats in

a minute. The pulse watch
was the first precision in-

strument that could be
used by physicians.

 

 

 

 

1709

 

Coke and Iron

Iron ore had required the
carbon and the high tem-
peratures of burning char-
coal ever since iron-
smelting had begun over
three thousand years before
(see 1000 B.c.). In England,
however, the price of char-
coal was climbing out of
sight as the forests dwin-
dled. Coke had been pro-
duced for half a century or
more but its use in iron-

smelting had not been
worked out.

The British ironworks
master Abraham Darby
(1678-1717) made the first
successful use of coke in
iron-smelting in 1709. In

fact, he found that lumps of

coke were stronger than
lumps of charcoal and
could support a larger
charge of iron ore, so that
iron could actually be pro-
duced at a faster rate. A
larger furnace meant more

draft and a hotter fire so
that iron production was
improved still further.

In short, Great Britain
was now producing the
best and most iron in the
world, and since iron could
be used for building ma-
chinery of all kinds, thanks
to its combination of
strength and cheapness,
Great Britain was set for
what would be called the
Industrial Revolution.

o
Rifle

If the muzzle of a gun is ri-
fled—that is, outfitted with
spiral grooves—the bullet
is set to spinning, and a
spinning bullet can be
aimed with greater preci-
sion. Rifling was tried from
the early days of gunnery,
but rifling requires a
greater force to push the
bullet through the muzzle,
which means that guns

have to be better con-
structed and are harder to
reload. On the whole, the
smooth-bore muzzles of
muskets seemed better.
About 1710 or soon
thereafter, however, the
Pennsylvania rifle was de-
signed by the Pennsylvania
Dutch (not Dutch, really,
but German immigrants).
The Pennsylvania rifle
took twice as long to reload
as the musket, but it had

two to three times the
range and much greater ac-
curacy. As long as soldiers
fought with muskets, they
had to maintain a straight
line, and all had to shoot at
once in the general direc-
tion of the enemy, hoping
that by sheer luck some bul-
lets would strike home. If
they fought soldiers with ri-
fles, the rifles could pick
them off before they could
even get in musket range.

 

1712

 

Newcomen
Steam Engine

The use of coke for iron
smelting (see 1709) in-

creased the demand for
coal out of which to make
coke, and that meant there

was a greater need for some

device to pump water out
of the coal mines. Savery’s

Miner’s Friend was too inef-
ficient and too dangerous.
In 1712 an English en-
gineer, Thomas Newcomen
(1663—-1729), devised a new
kind of steam engine. It

 
didn’t depend on using
steam to form a vacuum
that would suck water up-
ward and then using high-
pressure steam to blow it
out, Newcomen's engine
used ordinary low-pressure
steam to push a piston.
That meant the pistons
didn’t have to fit as tightly

as they must when high-
pressure steam is used, and
it meant the machine was
less dangerous.

Newcomen engines
proved quite popular, but
they were still terribly inef-
ficient. Most of the heat of
the burning fuel went into
heating the chamber till

water boiled into steam
and pushed the piston.
Then the chamber was
cooled to let the piston
move back, after which the
chamber had to be refilled
with water and heated all
over again for another for-
ward thrust.

 

1713

 

Smallpox
Inoculation

Smallpox was the dread
disease of this time. The
plague, which had been the
enormous danger of the last
half of the 1300s (see 1346),
still struck, but only in iso-
lated places and briefly,
and was never again quite
the universal danger it had
been in the earlier period,
perhaps because human be-
ings had gained greater im-
munity. Smallpox,
however, was increasing,
and the great dread it in-

spired was not merely be-
cause it frequently killed,
but because even when it
did not, it disfigured. The
large puckered pockmarks
it would form left faces vi-
sions of ugliness.

If one survived small-
pox, h()\.\’L’\'f'r, one was Safe
from a second attack. A pa-
tient would only get it
once. What's more, some
smallpox cases were rather
mild, didn’t kill, and only
slightly disfigured, but the
mild cases led to immunity
against a second attack just
as efficiently as severe cases
did. It followed that a mild

case of smallpox was actu-
ally better than none at all.

The reasoning, then,
was that if you knew some-
one with a mild case of
smallpox, you might get
close to him or her in the
hope that you would catch
a case just as mild.

In 1713, in fact, the
English poet Lady Mary
Wortley Montagu (1689—
1762), whose husband was
a British ambassador to
Turkey and who accompa-
nied him there, brought
back the news that in Tur-
key they were actually inoc-
ulating people with pus
from the pustules of people
with mild cases, to make
sure that the inoculated
person would get it. The
only trouble with that was
that you couldn’t always
tell—what was a mild case

1714

in one person might prove
to be a severe one, even a
deadly one, in the person
being inoculated. It was
very much like playing Rus-
sian roulette.

Nevertheless, such was

the fear of smallpox that,
for over three-fourths of a
century, many people sub-
mitted to such inoculation
(also called variolation from
variola, the medical term
for smallpox).

 

 

Mercury
Thermometer

As long as thermometers
were open to the air, like
those of Galileo (see 1592)
and Amontons (see 1699),
they were affected by air
pressure in one way or an-
other and were always lim-
ited in accuracy. The first
person to devise a closed
thermometer was Ferdi-
nand II de’ Medici (1610—
1670), who did so in 1654.
At first, sealed ther-

mometers used water or al-
cohol or mixtures of the
two, but these fluids pro-
duced vapors that intro-
duced pressure effects.
What's more, water didn't
expand and contract as
evenly with temperature as
was needed for good preci-
sion, while alcohol boiled
at too low a temperature.
The German physicist
Daniel Gabriel Fahrenheit
(1686-1736) worked with
alcohol thermometers at
first, but in 1714 he made
the key advance of using

mercury. Mercury stays lig-
uid between quite low tem-
peratures and quite high
temperatures, produces
very little vapor, and ex-
pands and contracts quite
evenly with temperature
change. It is an ideal fluid
for thermometers and is
still commonly used for the
purpose today.

Fahrenheit made an-
other advance toward the
setting of good standard
temperatures. He noted the
height of the mercury col-
umn in a mixture of ice,
water, and ammonium
chloride, which resulted in
the lowest temperature he
could get, and he called
that 0. A mixture of ice and
water he set at 32, and the

1715

temperature of boiling
water was then 212. This is
the Fahrenheit scale, and it
is still commonly used in
the United States to mea-

sure temperature.

The Fahrenheit ther-
mometer was the first that
could measure temperature
with sufficient accuracy to
be useful to scientists.

 

 

Solar Eclipse

On April 22, 1715, a solar
eclipse was to take place
and the path of totality was
to cross Great Britain and
parts of Europe. It had been
twenty-three centuries
since Thales had predicted
an eclipse (see 585 B.c.) and
it was perfectly understood
by astronomers that

eclipses were phenomena
that were natural, harm-
less, and splendid. Never-
theless, superstition is
immortal, and in order to
prevent as much panic as
possible, Halley (see 1678)
carefully plotted out the
path the eclipse would take
and prepared maps of it
well in adyance so that
everyone knew exactly

when he or she would see
the Sun lose its light.
Halley also organized a
large number of observers
throughout Europe to
watch and time the eclipse.
This was the first eclipse
for which astronomers
turned out en masse. From
this point on, every eclipse
would bring its crowd of ob-
serving astronomers.
1718

Stellar Motion

Ever since the motion of
the Sun, Moon, and planets
relative to the stars gener-
ally had been discovered in
Sumerian times, the chief

quality of the thousands of
remaining stars in the sky
had seemed to be that they
did not move relative to
each other. They were des-
ignated as the fixed stars

fixed to the solid firmament

of the sky, that is—w hlle

the various planets ci

Earth below the firmament.
In 1718, however, Hal-

ley (see 1678) determined

the position of the bright
stars Sirius, Procyon, and
Arcturus and observed that
they had changed their po-
sition markedly since Greek
times. They had even
changed position percepti-
bly since the time of T
Brahe (see 1572)

It didn’t seem possible
that the Greeks had made
mistakes that large in re-
cording their data, and it
was even less possible that
Tycho had made such mis-
takes. Halley therefore con-
cluded that the stars were
not fixed but moving. It
was because they were so

 

distant that their “proper
motions” were too small to
ob ¢ until they

mulated over extended peri-
ods of time.

With Halley, then, tt
firmament—the solid vault
of the sky that everyone
had accepted till then, ar
that even had the authority
of the Bib did not exist.
The stars e, rather, like
a swarm of very distant
and widely spread-out bees,
each moving at its own
speed and in its own direc-
tion.
1722

 

Easter Island

Dots of land scattered over
the Pacific remained to be
discovered by Europeans
even two centuries after
Magellan had made the
first crossing (see 1523). In
1722 the Dutch navigator
Jacob Roggeveen (1659—
1729) came across a small
island, 45 square miles in
area, that was one of the

most isolated bits of land in
the world. It was 1,200
miles from the nearest
land, which was another
small island like itself.
Since the island was
sighted on Easter Sunday,
it was named Passeisland
in Dutch, or Easter Island
in English.

Easter Island was prob-
ably the farthest point
reached by the Polynesians

 

in their settlement of the
Pacific Islands (see 1642).
The island is best known
for six hundred stone stat-
ues of a type found no-
where else. This has lent
the island an air of mystery
that it probably doesn’t de-
Serve.

Later in the same voy-
age, Roggeveen discovered
the Samoan Islands.

 

1728

 

Ship’s
Chronometer

If a ship wants to locate it-
self on the ocean, it can
measure its latitude (the

distance north or south of
the equator) by taking the
position of the Sun at maxi-
mum height or the position
of the North Star and calcu-
lating the distance of either
from the zenith. To mea-

sure a ship’s longitude (the
distance east or west of its
home port), however, can
be done accurately only if
the exact time is known,
which presented a problem
at this time. A pendulum
 

 

clock would obviously fail
to work on the swaying
deck of a ship, and the
watches of the time were in-
sufficiently accurate.

In 1714 the British gov-
ernment offered a prize of
twenty thousand pounds,
an incredible fortune in
those days, to anyone who
would devise a method of
determining a ship’s longi-
tude. The sum was clearly
worth it, to be sure, consid-
ering the improvement it
would make in a ship’s abil-
ity to navigate accurately
and the profits that would
result from accelerated
trade.

Beginning in 1728, an
English instrument-maker,
John Harrison (1693—1776),
built a series of five clocks,
each one better than the
one before. Each clock was
so mounted that it could
take the sway of a ship with-
out being adversely af-
fected. He designed a
pendulum of different met-
als so that it would stay the
same length and give the
same beat even as tempera-
ture changed. He also in-
serted a mechanism that
would keep the clock going
while it was being wound.
Any one of Harrison's
clocks met the demands of
the prize conditions. In
fact, they were more accu-
rate at sea than any other
clock then known was on
land. One of Harrison's

chronometers was off by
less than a minute after five
months at sea.

The British parliament,
however, put on an extraor-
dinary display of miserli-
ness in this connection. It
put off the payment to Har-
rison for years, and he did
not get the full amount
until 1773.

Aberration
of Light

Since Copernicus’s book
(see 1543) nearly two centu-
ries before, the question of
the parallax of the stars
had bothered astronomers.
If the Earth did indeed
move about the Sun, that
should induce a parallactic
displacement among the
nearer stars as compared
with the farther ones. View-
ing a nearby star from one
side of the Sun and then
viewing it again from the
other side, 186,000,000
miles away, should produce
a displacement—but it
didn't.

Those who accepted Co-
pernicus and Kepler felt
this was because even the
nearest stars were so far
away that their parallax
was too small to measure.
Still, telescopes were con-
stantly improving, so as-
tronomers kept trying.

One of those who tried
was a British astronomer,

James Bradley (1693~
1762). Bradley, using a tele-
scope 212 feet long, tried to
measure the small displace-
ment of stars in the course
of the year and actually de-
tected such a displacement.
What he found, however,
could not be parallax, be-
cause the displacement did
not coincide with what
would be expected if it
were the result of Earth's
changing position in its
orbit.

Bradley looked for an
alternate explanation and
one occurred to him in
1728: The displacement
arose because the telescope
had to be tipped slightly to
catch the light as the Earth
moved (this is called ad-
justing to the aberration of
light), just as an umbrella
must be tipped when you're
walking briskly through a
rainstorm in which the
drops are falling vertically.
The amount by which the
telescope must be tipped
depends on the ratio of the
speed of the Earth in its
orbit to the speed of light.

This meant that al-
though Bradley had not de-
tected parallax, he had
discovered a new way of
calculating the speed of
light, since the speed of the
Earth in its orbit was
known and the amount of
the tipping of the telescope
was known, too. This was
the first determination of
the speed of light since

Roemer’s a half-century be-

fore (see 1675) and it was a
more accurate measure-
ment. Bradley’s figure was
176,000 miles per second,
only 5 percent less than the
true value.

What’s more, the exis-
tence of light aberration
was just as strong a proof
that the Earth was moving
as the existence of stellar
parallax would have been.

Bering Strait

As Peter I's reign drew to-
ward its close, the Russian
occupation of Siberia was
complete. The question re-

mained, though, of whether

there was a land connec-
tion between Siberia and
North America. Peter com-
missioned a Danish naviga-
tor, Vitus Jonassen Bering
(1681-1741), to look into it.

In 1725 Bering crossed
Siberia overland and
reached Kamchatka, which
he was the first to map.
From Kamchatka, he sailed
north in 1728 and reached
the ice of the Arctic Ocean
without sighting land. He
had sailed through what is
now known as the Bering
Strait, which separates Si-
beria from Alaska. The sea
to the south is the Bering
Sea.

Finally, two and a quar-
ter centuries after Colum-

bus (see 1492), it was
shown definitely that North
America was not part of
Asia.

Dentistry

The first book to be devoted
entirely to dentistry ap-
peared in 1728. It was Le
chirurgien dentiste (The
Dental Surgeon), and it was
written by a French dentist,
Pierre Fauchard (1678-
1761). He discussed artifi-
cial dentures and crowns
and described how to treat
caries by cleaning out the
decay and making use of
metal fillings. Because of
this, Fauchard is consid-
ered the father of dentistry.

 

1729

 

Electrical
Conductance

The interest in static elec-

tricity produced by Hauks-
bee’s friction machine (see
1706) began to bring about
results. An English experi-
menter, Stephen Gray

(1666—1736), found that
when he electrified a long
glass tube, the corks at the
end were also electrified
even though they had not
been touched. The elec-
tricity, whatever it was,
had clearly traveled from
the glass into the corks.
Gray thought, therefore,

that electricity was a
fluid.

He experimented fur-
ther, causing the electrical
fluid to travel through long
stretches of twine (as long
as 800 feet). He found that
the fluid flowed more easily
through some substances
than through others. This
| led to the division of sub-

| stances into conductors and
nonconductors. Noncon-
ductors might also be

called insulators, from the
Latin word for “island,”
since a nonconductor could
pen up the electric fluid

and keep it confined, as the
sea confines an island

Achromatic
Lens

. Newton had been con-
vinced that a lens was
bound to produce colors at
the focus that would blur
|  the image (see 1666). How-
| ever, an English mathema-
tician, Chester Moor Hall
(1703—1771), noticed some-
thing Newton had missed:
different kinds of glass pro-
duced spectra of different
widths. Flint glass (con-
taining lead) produced a
rather wider spectrum than
crown glass (ordinary win-
dow glass) did.

Hall therefore decided
to make a convex lens out
| of crown glass and a con-
cave lens out of flint glass,
designed in such a way that
the two would fit together
to form a single biconvex
lens. The crown glass
would spread out the col-

 

 

ors, while the flint glass
would bring them together
again without neutralizing
all the magnifying value of
the crown glass. The end re-
sult was an achromatic
(from Greek words mean-
ing “'no color”) lens, which
would magnify an object
without producing colors.

Hall did not publicize
his lens properly, and John
Dollond (1706—1761), who
prepared an achromatic
lens in 1757, often gets the
credit. In any case, the ach-
romatic lens made it possi-
ble to use the entire lens
and to have a short focal
length, so that telescopes
could be made shorter and
more convenient—and bet-
ter, too.

Blood Pressure

Hales (see 1705) had stud-
ied the flow of sap in plants
and went on to study the

flow of blood in animals,
measuring the rate of flow
in different portions of the
circulatory system. Most
important of all, he was the
first person to measure
blood pressure, albeit in a
crude way. He described
his work in this field in a
book entitled Hemostaticks,
published in 1733.

Two Electrical
Fluids

The French physicist
Charles-Francois de Cister-
nay du Fay (1698—1739)
was experimenting with
static electricity as so many
scientists were doing at this
time. In 1733 he found that
two bits of cork electrified
by the same means repelled
each other.

He found, however,
that if one cork ball was
electrified by means of an

 
 

 

electrified glass rod, and an-
other by means of an elec-
trified resin rod, the two
cork balls attracted each
other.

Du Fay decided there
must be two electrical flu-
ids and he called them vitre-
ous (from a Latin word for
“glass”) electricity and resin-
ous electricity. One form of
electricity attracted the
other, but each repelled it-
self. This was similar to the
well-known magnetic prop-
erty that like poles repelled
each other but unlike poles
attracted each other. Thus
began the process of de-
tecting similarities and in-
terconnections between

electricity and magnetism,
which was to become par-

ticularly important a cen-

tury later.

Flying Shuttle

In weaving, a shuttle, with
the yarn (the woof)
attached, must be led
across a long series of other
yarns (the warp), in and
out, to form a strong textile
material.

In 1733 a British ma-
chinist, John Kay (1704-
1764), invented the flying
shuttle, a device whereby
the weaver, by pulling a
cord, could activate a
driver that would send the

shuttle flying across the
loom. Pulling the cord in
the opposite direction
would send it on its return
journey. The vertical

(warp) yarns were automat-
ically separated so that the
flying shuttle could pass
quickly in and out through
them.

This was one of the
early examples of a factory
process being mechanized
so that one person could do
more work much more
quickly with far less effort.
It pointed the way to the
coming Industrial Revolu-
tion.

 
1735

 

Shape of
the Earth

Newton had suggested that,
on the basis of his gravita-
tional theory, the Earth
ought to be an oblate spher-
oid and have an equatorial
bulge, because it was rotat-
ing (see 1687, Universal
Gravitation). Plans were
now being made to check
this prediction by actual
measurement.

If the polar regions
were slightly flattened and
the equatorial regions were
slightly bulging, a degree of
latitude near the poles
should be slightly greater
in mileage than a degree of
latitude near the Equator.
To see if that were so, two
expeditions were sent out
by the French in 1735. One,
under the French geogra-
pher Charles-Marie de La
Condamine (1701-1774),
was sent to Peru, quite near
the Equator. The other,
under the French mathema-
tician Pierre-Louis Moreau
de Maupertuis (1698—1759),
went to Lapland, which
was about as close to the
pole as Europeans could
venture in those days.

The results, when fi-
nally achieved, completely

supported Newton. The de-
gree of latitude was 1 per-
cent longer near the poles
than near the Equator, Sea
level at the Equator, we
now know, is 13 miles far-
ther from the Earth'’s cen-
ter than sea level at the
poles.

Before returning to Eu-
rope, by the way, La Con-
damine explored the
Amazon River region. This
was the first time it had
been explored in depth by a
European since Orellana
(see 1542), and La Condam-
ine brought back the first
rubber and curare to Eu-
rope.

Taxonomy

Carl von Linné (1707—
1778), born in Sweden, is
better known by the Latin-
ized version of his name,
Carolus Linnaeus. Always
interested in plants, he trav-
eled 4,600 miles through
northern Scandinavia,
where he discovered a hun-
dred new species of plants.
He also traveled through
Great Britain and western
Europe.

In 1735 he published
Systema Naturae (Systemns of
Nature), in which he classi-
fied numerous plants, ex-

tending the classification in
later editions to animals.

Linnaeus was remark-
able for the methodical
way he went about his clas-
sifications. Similar species
were grouped into genera
(singular, genus); similar
genera into classes; similar
classes into orders. He de-
scribed each species con-
cisely and gave it a double
name, genus and species (bi-
nomial nomenclature).
Thus, he was the first to
call human beings mem-
bers of the species Homo sa-
piens.

Linnaeus's systematic
process made him the fa-
ther of modern taxonomy
(from Greek words mean-
ing “naming in order’").
What's more, his system of
groups, groups of groups,
groups of groups of groups,
and so on gave his descrip-
tion of living things the ap-
pearance of a tree in which
large branches divided into
smaller branches, those
into smaller still, until the
final twigs were the species.
This made the notion of bio-
logical evolution seem
more natural than ever, but
Linnaeus himself was
strongly antievolution
and clung to the tale in
Genesis.

 
Trade Winds

Half a century before, Hal-
ley had tried to explain the
trade winds and monsoon
but had missed one essen-
tial point (see 1686). The

1736

British physicist George
Hadley (1685-1768) now
supplied it. He pointed out
that air near the Equator
had a faster west-to-east
motion than air farther
from the Equator. There-

fore, winds moving away
from the Equator tended to
drift eastward, while winds
moving toward the Equator
tended to drift westward.
This view proved satisfac-
tory.

 

Mechanics

Even Newton clung to an-
cient conventions when he
could. He wrote his great
book (see 1687) in Latin
rather than in English, and

although he obtained his re-

sults by the use of calculus,
he managed to put the
proofs into geometric forms
in his book.

In 1736, however, the
Swiss mathematician
Leonhard Euler (1707—
1783), the most prolific of

all time, wrote the first
book—Mechanics—to be
entirely devoted to that sub-
ject. In place of Newton'’s
geometry, he made use of
algebra and calculus when-
ever he could.
 

1737

 

Cobalt

It puzzled miners that a
blue mineral resembling
copper ore did not yield
copper when smelted. The
miners assumed it was cop-
per ore that had been be-
witched by kobolds—earth
spirits who were thought to
be malevolent at times.
In 1737 a Swedish
chemist, Georg Brandt
(1694—-1768), investigated

1738

   

the blue ore and managed
to obtain a metal from it
but one that was definitely
not copper. Brandt gave it
the name of the earth
spirit, spelling it cobalt,
and that is still the name of
the element.

Cobalt was the first
new element discovered
since Brand’s discovery of
phosphorus three-quarters
of a century earlier (see
1669). Since phosphorus is

not a metal, cobalt was also
the first metal to be discov-
ered that was not known to
the ancients or to the medi-
eval alchemists,

Brandt was perhaps
the first important chemist
to be completely free of any
alchemical taint, and after
him the discovery of new el-
ements continued till con-
temporary times.

 

Kinetic Theory
of Gases

Boyle had supposed gases
to consist of widely spaced
atoms, since that would ac-
count for the fact that gases
could be compressed-(see
1662).

This notion was carried
further by a Swiss mathe-
matician, Daniel Bernoulli
(1700—1782). He assumed
that the atoms making up
gases were always in rapid,

random movement, collid-
ing with each other and
with the walls of the con-
taining vessel. (This is
called the kinetic theory of
gases; kinetic is from the
Greek word for “motion.")
If the temperature

rises, the atoms move faster

and collide harder and thus
move a bit farther away
from each other. For that
reason, the volume in-
creases as the temperature
rises and decreases as the
temperature falls, if pres-

 

sure remains the same. If
the volume is kept from
changing, then the pressure
(the force with which the
atoms hit the walls) in-
creases as the temperature
goes up and decreases as
the temperature goes down.

This description turned
out to be correct, but an ad-
equate mathematical treat-
ment of the subject did not
arrive for another century
and a quarter.
 

1739

 

Rocky
Mountains

The French were continu-
ing their exploration of the
interior of North America.
The explorer Pierre
Gaultier de Varennes de La

Vérendrye (1685-1749) had
been pushing westward
from the Great Lakes since
1731 and by the end of the
decade had discovered
Lake Winnipeg and the
Black Hills of South Da-
kota.

Two French brothers,

Pierre and Paul Mallet, had
reached Colorado in 1739
and were the first Europe-
ans to get a glimpse of the
Rocky Mountains.

 

1740

 

Hydra

The Swiss naturalist Abra-
ham Trembley (1700—
1784), working in the Dutch
Republic, discovered the
freshwater hydra in 1740.
This was a small, very prim-
itive organism, which re-

sembled a plant somewhat
in appearance, but which
Trembley showed to be an
animal. It had tentacles,

1d seemed a tiny and
harmless replica of the fear-
some Hydra destroyed by
Hercules in the Greek
myths.

  

The resemblance was
all the closer in that the
mythical Hydra grew back
heads that were lopped off
and the tiny freshwater
hydra could regenerate
parts that were cut off. In
fact, Trembley showed that
if a hydra was cut in two,
each half could grow into a
complete organism, and if
two hydra were grafted to-
gether they would form a

single individual. This
showed that such proper-
ties, thought to be exclusive
to plants, clearly existed in

  

animals, loo, if the animals
were sufficiently primitive

 

1742

 

Celsius Scale

For nearly thirty years, the
Fahrenheit scale (see 1714)
had been commonly used
for temperature measure-
ments. It had some disad-
vantages, however. For
instance, the freezing point
of water was set at 32 de-
grees, a curiously uneven
number.

It makes a huge differ-
ence, both to scientists and
to human beings generally,
whether water is liquid or
solid, whether a pond is fro-
zen over or not, whether it
snows or rains. In 1742,
therefore, the Swedish as-
tronomer Anders Celsius
(1701-1744) suggested that
the freezing point of water
be set at 0 degrees, so that a
positive reading meant
water and a negative read-

ing meant ice. The boiling
point of water would then
be set at 100 degrees,
rather than 212.

This new scale was at
first called the Centigrade
scale (from Latin words
meaning “‘a hundred steps”
—that is, from the freezing
point to the boiling point of
water), but this was con-
verted to Celsius scale by in-
ternational agreement in
1948. The entire world has
now adopted the Celsius
scale with only one signifi-
cant exception—the United
States.

Goldbach’s
Conjecture

A mathematician who
lhinks some statement
seemns true but can't prove

it’s true may then advance
it as a conjecture. Fermat'’s
Last Theorem (see 1637) is
not a conjecture; Fermat
stated flatly that he had a
proof—though he may have
been mistaken, to be sure.

The most famous ac-
tual conjecture is one made
by a German mathemati-
cian who worked in Russia,
Christian Goldbach (1690—
1764).

To explain it, we begin
by saying that a prime num-
ber is any number greater
than 1 that can only be di-
vided by itself and 1. There
are an infinite number of
primes. The first few are
2,3,5,7,11, 13, 17; 19;
and 23.

It seemed to Goldbach
that any even number
greater than 2 could be ex-
pressed as the sum of two
 

 

primes (sometimes in more
than one way). Thus, 4 = 2
+2;6 =3+ 3;8=5+3;
10=5+512=7+5; 14
=7+7;16 =11 + 5;18
=13+ 5;20= 13 + 7; 22
=11+ 11;24 = 13 + 11;

13;34 = 17 + 17; 36 = 23
+13;38 =19+ 19;40 =
23 + 17;42 = 23 + 19; and
so on.

No mathematician has
ever found an even number
higher than 2 that could
not be expressed as the sum
of two prime numbers.
Every mathematician is
convinced that no such
number exists and that
Goldbach's conjecture is
true. However, no mathe-
matician has ever been able
to prove the conjecture.

But that sort of thing is
the excitement of mathe-
matics and of science gener-
ally. We shall never run out
of problems, and some will
always remain incredibly
tantalizing.

Franklin Stove

Originally, campfires were
built in the open, or inside
a cave. Fires in confined
areas presented a problem
with smoke, so chimneys
had to be invented. Fire-
places and chimneys are
wasteful, however. Hot air
from the fire goes straight
up the chimney and does
not warm much of the
room. Indeed, the rising hot
air creates a draft that
brings cold air in from the
outside.

It occurred to Benja-
min Franklin (see 1733)
that what was needed was
an iron stove within a
room. Inside that a fire
could be built that would
create no draft but would
heat up the metal. That in
turn would heat the air,
and the warm air would
stay inside the room in-
stead of vanishing up a
chimney. As for the smoke,
that could pass through a
stovepipe into the chimney.

Stoves of this sort grew
instantly popular, and in-
deed, the modern home fur-
nace in the basement is a
kind of Franklin stove.
 

1744

 

Transcendental
Numbers

One would think that math-
ematicians had dealt with
all the different kinds of
numbers there were—inte-
gers, fractions, negative
numbers, irrational num-
bers, imaginary numbers,
what else could there be?
In 1744 Leonhard

Euler (see 1736) pointed
out that polynomial alge-
braic equations, consisting
of powers of x, can have all
sorts of solutions—whole
numbers, fractions, irratio-
nals, negatives, imaginar-
ies, complex numbers, and
so on. These are all alge-
braic numbers.
Nevertheless, Euler
pointed out, there are other
numbers that can never be

a solution for any algebraic
equation that can possibly
be written. Such numbers
are transcendental numbers,
from Latin words meaning
“to climb beyond,” because
they climb beyond the
equations, so to speak. We
now know that there are an
infinite number of transcen-
dental numbers.

 

1745

 

Leyden Jar

Hauksbee's glass sphere
(see 1706), first produced
forty years earlier, was sur-
passed as an electricity-
storing device by the work
of a Dutch physicist, Pieter
van Musschenbroek (1692—
1761).

In 1745 he placed
water in a metal container
suspended by insulating

silk cords, and led a brass
wire through a cork into
the water. He built up an
electric charge in the water
but did not realize how
much had accumulated in
the device until an assis-
tant happened to pick it up
and touch the brass wire
outside the cork. The con-
tainer promptly discharged
all of the electric charge it
had accumulated and gave

 

the poor assistant a fearful
shock. It was the first good-
sized artifical electric shock
anyone had ever received.
(The lightning stroke is
worse, of course, but it is a
natural electric shock.)

A German physicist,
Ewald Georg von Kleist
(1700—-1748), independently
produced the same device
at about the same time. He
discovered the strength of
the charge by accidentally
discharging it into his own
body. He said he wouldn’t
take another such shock to
be the king of France and
worked with the device no
longer.

Because Musschen-
broek popularized the de-
vice and because he worked
at the University of Leyden
in the Netherlands, the elec-
tricity-storing device came
to be called a Leyden jar. It
was at once made use of by
other experimenters.

Blood and Iron

Chemists had little or no
idea of the composition of
living tissue—even what el-

ements it contained, since
so little was known about
the elements.

Of course, iron was
known, and an Italian phy-
sician, Vincenzo Menghini
(1704-1759), fed iron prepa-
rations to dogs in 1745 in
order to see what would
happen to the iron and
whether any of it would be
incorporated in the tissues.
To make sure that no iron
was present in dogs that
didn’t eat the iron prepara-
tion, he obtained blood
from normal dogs and
burned it, expecting to find
no iron in the ash. How-
ever, he did find iron, to his
surprise. What's more, he
was able to ascertain that

the iron was present, spe-
cifically, in the red blood
corpuscles.

This represented the
first discovery in living tis-
sue of a trace element; that
is, one present in only
small quantities but never-
theless essential to life
(though the fact that iron
was essential to life was not
yet understood).

 

1747

 

Scurvy

Ever since Vasco da
Gama's voyage (see 1497),
scurvy had been an increas-

ing menace. More men
were disabled by scurvy on
long voyages than by any
other cause. This was par-
ticularly serious in Great

Britain, which depended on
its navy for protection and
on its merchant ships for
its prosperity.

A British physician,
 

James Lind (1716—1794),
had served in the navy and
knew that the diet on board
ship was monotonous in
the extreme, consisting of
hardtack, salt pork, and
other food items whose
only virtue was that they
didn'’t spoil in an age with-
out refrigeration or can-
ning. He also knew that

scurvy appeared in prisons,
in besieged towns, on over-
land exploring expeditions
—always where diet was
limited and monotonous.
Lind therefore studied
the effect of adding food
items that didn’t last well,
especially fruits and vegeta-
bles, to the diet of people af-
fected with scurvy. In 1747

he found that citrus fruits
worked amazingly well in
effecting relief. It was
nearly half a century, how-
ever, before the British
navy could bestir itself to
make use of that fact and
put an end to the menace of
scurvy.

 

1748

 

Osmosis

It is a common observation
that liquids will soak
through some materials but
not others. But if a liquid
soaks through a particular
material, it seems reason-
able to suppose that it will
soak through in either di-
rection.

Nevertheless, when a
French experimenter, Jean-
Antoine Nollet (1700—
1770), covered an alcoholic
solution with a section of
pig’s bladder and placed it
in a tub of water, the blad-

N

der began to bulge over a
period of time as though
more water was entering
the solution than was leav-
ing it. Eventually, the blad-
der membrane burst,

In this way, Nollet dis-
covered what is now called
a semipermeable membrane
—that is, one permeable to
some fluids but not to oth-
ers. If there are different
fluids on the two sides of
such a membrane (pure
water on one side, for in-
stance, and an alcoholic so-
lution on the other), the
fluid flow in one direction

may be greater than in the
other. This is called osnio-
sis (from a Greek word
meaning “push,” since the
fluid ends by pushing
through in one direction).

The explanation for os-
mosis had to wait half a
century till the notion of
molecules of different sizes
was understood.

Platinum

Gold, silver, and copper are
not the only rare metals

sometimes found in free me-
tallic form. Another is plati-
num. A metallic casket
found among the relics of
seventh century B.c. Egypt
is reported to be of plati-
num. In general, however,
the existence of this metal
remained unremarked and
unknown. For one thing,
platinum is as rare as gold,
but it lacks gold’s ostenta-
tious beauty. Platinum has
a dull, leaden color when

unpolished that does not at-
tract the eye.

In 1748, however, a
Spanish scientist, Antonio
de Ulloa (1716-1795), pub-
lished a report on his trav-
els in South America. In it,
he reported on platina
(from a Spanish word for
“silver,” chiefly because it
was a free metal that
lacked the pronounced

color of gold or copper). He
remarked on its peculiar
properties, for when prop-
erly examined, it turned
out to be denser than gold,
higher-melting, and even
less reactive. Eventually, it
proved extremely useful to
scientists for just these
properties.

 

1749

 

Biological
Evolution

Until now, natural histori-
ans who had been busily en-
gaged in classifying life
forms had refrained, out of
religious conviction or out
of prudence, from drawing
the logical conclusion that
biological evolution had
taken place.

The first important sci-
entist to speculate openly
on evolution was the
French naturalist Georges-
Louis Leclerc de Buffon
(1707-1788).In 1749, he

began publishing volumes
of his book Natural History,
which was eventually to
consist of forty-four vol-
umes.

Buffon treated evolu-
tion as a matter of degener-
ation. It is, after all, a
common observation that
many things deteriorate
with time. Why should not
evolution exemplify this?
Buffon maintained that
apes were degenerated hu-
mans, donkeys degenerated
horses, jackals degenerated
wolves, and so on.

This view is quite
wrong, but it implied that

species did change with
time, which was crucially
important. It also sufficed
to get Buffon into a certain
amount of trouble, which
he managed to smooth over
with diplomatic recanta-
tions.

Formation of
the Earth

Buffon (see above) was also
daring enough to think that
there might be some natu-
ral cause, one not involving
God, for Earth’s coming
into existence. In the first
volume of his Natural His-
tory, he suggested that
Earth (and presumably the
other planets) had been
formed by the collision of
the Sun with another mas-
sive body (which he called
a comet).

Buffon then tried to de-
cide how old the Earth was
by calculating how many
years it would take an ob-

ject the size of the Earth to
cool from the temperature
of the Sun to the tempera-
ture of the Earth today.
This, he eventually an-
nounced, could be as much
as 75,000 years; Earth had
grown cool enough to sup-
port life about 40,000 years
before, and it would exist
for another 90,000 years be-
fore becoming too cold

to support lite any
longer.

To be sure, Buffon'’s es-
timates of these values
were much smaller than
the time periods scientists
were to accept later on, but
he was the first important
scientist to suggest that the
Earth might be much older
than the 6,000 years allot-
ted it by Ussher (see 1650).

 

1751

 

Nickel

Although Brandt had iso-
lated cobalt fourteen years
before (see 1737), the prob-
lem of copper ore that did
not yield copper persisted.
Some of this sort of ore
didn’t yield cobalt, either,
and the miners called it
kupfernickel (Old Nick's cop-
per, with reference to the
devil).

In 1751 a Swedish min-
eralogist, Axel Fredrick
Cronstedt (1722—1765),
who had studied under
Brandt, tackled kupfer-
nickel and isolated from it
a white metal that was nei-
ther copper nor cobalt.
Cronstedt called it nickel,

taking the second half of
the miners’ name.

Cronstedt discovered
that nickel, like iron but
less strongly, was attracted
by a magnet. It was the
first time that anything but
iron had been found to be
attracted by a magnet. As a
matter of fact, magnets
were eventually found to at-
tract cobalt as well.

Indeed, iron, cobalt,
and nickel are very similar
metals. This was the first
hint that elements might be
grouped into families and
that some sort of order
might be imposed on
them—but that did not
take place for another
century.

 

Encyclopedias

The growing accumulation
of knowledge and the grow-
ing self-confidence of the
scientists of this period
(which called itself the Age
of Reason) made it natural
to think of preparing a mul-
tivelume summary of all
knowledge for the general
public, under headings ar-
ranged in alphabetical
order. This would be an en-
cyclopedia, from Greek
words meaning “general ed-
ucation.”

A rather modest sugges-
tion to this effect was made
by a bookseller to a prolific
French free-lance writer,
Denis Diderot (1713—1784)
Diderot caught fire and
made a huge project out of
it. He used collaborators
but in the end did most of
the work alone. The first
volume appeared in 1751.

Diderot's product was
the first modern encyclope-
dia. It took a completely ra-
tional view of the world
and clearly opposed the
shibboleths of state and

church at that time. It im-
pressed intellectuals as the
supreme product of the Age
of Reason.

Lightning Rod

The Leyden jar (see 1745)
had become a favorite play-
thing of many scientists.
One of them was Benjamin
Franklin.

In 1747 Franklin re-
jected du Fay's notion of
two electrical fluids (see
1733). He thought there
was only one, which could
exist in an excess (above
normal) or in a deficiency
(below normal). Excess re-
pelled excess, since neither
could accept the other’s.
Similarly, deficiency re-
pelled deficiency, since nei-
ther could offer anything to
the other. Excess, however,
attracted deficiency, and
the electrical fluid poured
from the excess to the defi-
ciency, neutralizing both

and leaving each un-
charged.

Franklin suggested that
the excess be called positive
electricity and the defi-
ciency negative electricity.
There was no telling which
variety of electricity, vitre-
ous or resinous, was posi-
tive and which negative.
Franklin guessed arbi-
trarily and happened to
guess wrong. That makes
no difference, however. The
names can be used and the
literal meanings forgotten.

Franklin noted the
manner of discharge of the
Leyden jar. When the elec-
trical charge was drawn
off, it emitted a spark of
light and a erackle of
sound. Franklin was struck
by the similarity to a tiny
lightning stroke and an

equally tiny crack of thun-
der. He at once reversed the
thought. During a thunder-
storm, did Earth and sky
set up a gigantic Leyden
jar, and was the lightning
and thunder an equally gi-
gantic discharge?

He decided to experi-
ment. In 1751, he flew a
kite in a thunderstorm. The
kite carried a metal point
to which a long silk thread
was attached. At the bot-
tom of the thread, near
Franklin (who held onto the
silk by way of a second i
thread that remained dry), 4
was a metal key. As the
thunderclouds gathered
and the silk thread began to
show signs of electrical
charge (the separate fibers :
repelled each other), Frank- -
lin put his knuckle near the
key and it sparked and
crackled just like a Leyden
jar. Moreover, Franklin
charged a Leyden jar from
the key just as easily as if it
were a friction machine.
The Leyden jar charged by
heavenly electricity be-
haved precisely as though
it had been charged by
earthly electricity. The two
electricities were identical.
Franklin was able to
put his discovery to practi-
cal use at once. Lightning,
he decided, hit a particular
building when that build-
ing gathered charge during
a thunderstorm. His experi-
ence with Leyden jars
showed that they dis-
charged much more easily
if a sharp needle was
attached to them. Indeed,
the charge leaked out so
easily through the needle
that they couldn't be
charged in the first place.
Why not, then, attach a
sharp metal rod to the top
of a building, and ground it
properly, so that any
charge that gathered might
leak away rapidly and si-
lently and no charge would
accumulate to the point
where a disastrous dis-
charge would be forced.
Franklin published his
thoughts on the matter in
1752 in Poor Richard's Al-
manac, and the lightning
rods, as they were called,
began to go up at once, first
in America and then in Eu-

rope. They proved effica-
cious, and for the first time
in history, a natural catas-
trophe was averted not by
prayer or by magical incan-
tations of one sort or an-
other, which never really
worked, but by reliance on
an understanding of natu-
ral laws, which did work.
Once lightning rods ap-
peared on church steeples
(which, being the highest
point in town, were particu-
larly vulnerable), the point
was made for all to see.

Digestion

Was digestion a physical ac-
tion (the result of the grind-
ing of the stomach) or a
chemical one (the result of
fermentation)? The contro-
versy had been going on for
a century.

In 1752, a French physi-
cist, René-Antoine Fer-
chault de Réaumur (1683—
1757), induced a hawk to
swallow metal cylinders
that were open at both
ends, with those ends cov-
ered by wire gauze. Inside
the cylinder was meat.

Ordinarily, a hawk
swallows its food in large
pieces, digests what it can,
and regurgitates the indi-
gestible remainder. Ré-
aumur waited for the hawk
to regurgitate the cylinder
and found the meat par-
tially dissolved. Clearly, the
meat could not have been

Lol

affected by grinding or by
any mechanical action,
since the metal cylinders
protected it from that.
Therefore, the stomach
juices must have had a
chemical effect on the
meat.

He checked this further
by persuading the hawk to
swallow a small sponge.
When that was regurgi-
tated, it was soaked with
stomach juice, which Ré-
aumur squeezed out and
collected. He found that
this stomach juice slowly
dissolved meat placed in it.
He experimented with
dogs, too, and obtained the
same results. Muscles and
bones might behave like
mechanical systems, but
the body was a chemical de-
vice as well, and as scien-
tists increasingly
discovered, the chemistry is
even more important than
the mechanics.

Earth and Heat

There is ample evidence
that the Earth's surface has
undergone enormous
changes in its history, and
there must be titanic forces
behind those changes. Up
to this time, most Europe-
ans took it for granted that
the causative factor was
water and, in particular,
the action of Noah'’s Flood,
which was considered a
God-caused cataclysm far
more forcible than any
natural flood could have
been. Those who believed
this were called

Neptunists.

In 1752, however, a
French geologist, Jean-
Etienne Guettard (1715~
1786), was convinced by his
observations that the rocks

he saw in central France
had experienced great heat
at some time in the past.
This began the belief in
heat as the causative factor.

 

1754

 

Carbon Dioxide

Carbon dioxide had been
studied by Helmont (see
1624), but until this time it
had only been detected as a
product of combustion or
fermentation.

In 1754, however, a
Scottish chemist, Joseph
Black (1728-1799), in his
thesis for a medical degree
(which he published two
years later), described how
he had formed a gas by
strongly heating limestone
(calcium carbonate), leav-
ing lime (calcium oxide) be-
hind. The gas he produced
would combine with cal-
cium oxide to form calcium
carbonate once again. He

called the gas fixed air, be-
cause it could be fixed
(made to take on a solid
form) by combination with
calcium oxide. Fixed air
turned out to be carbon di-
oxide.

It was clear, then, that
gases could be formed from
ordinary solids and that
they could take part in
chemical reactions. That
went far toward converting
gases from mysteries to
chemicals.

In fact, since calcium
oxide slowly turned to cal-
cium carbonate if simply al-
lowed to remain exposed to
air, it was clear that there
must be some small frac-
tion of the air that was car-

bon dioxide. That was the
first indication that air was
not a simple substance (an
element) but a mixture of
different gases.

In studying the action
of heat on calcium carbon-
ate, by the way, Black mea-
sured the loss of weight
involved in its conversion
to calcium oxide. He also
measured the amount of
acid that a given quantity
of calcium carbonate would
neutralize. This was the
first application of quanti-
tative analysis to chemical
reactions, a chemical wave
of the future that could
come to fruition in a quar-
ter of a century.
1755

Galaxy

Do the stars in the sk
spread out evenly and in-
definitely in all directions
or are they contained in a
finite volume with a partic-
ular shape. To the eye it
might seem that the first al-
ternative is correct—except
for the Milky Way. Once
Galileo showed that the
Milky Way consisted of

v many, very dim stars
(see 1609), it became clear
that there are far more
stars in the direction of the
Milky Way than in other di-
rections. In 1750, an En-

glish astro! er, Thomas
Wright (1711-1786), main-
tained that the stars
formed a flattened finite
system, but his writings

re so mystical that it
was hard to take him seri-
ously.

In 1755, however, the
German philosopher Im-
manuel Kant (1724—1804)
made a similar suggestion.
He said the Sun was one of
a large number of stars that
existed in a lens-shaped
conglomerate, and that the

<y Way was the result of

ng into the sky along
of the lens.

 

This conglomerate came to
be called the Galaxy, from a
Greek word for the Milky
Way. Kant also suggested
that certain nebulas

he called them in a dr.
matic phrase, “island uni-
verses."'

In this, Kant was quite
correct, but it was to be
over half a century before

y demon-
strated and over a century
and a half before the exis-

f other gal
could be demonstrated
 

1756

 

Land Bridges

In the book of Genesis, God
is described as separating
land and sea on the third
day of creation. It does not
say that God fixed the
boundaries eternally, but
this was assumed. It was
taken for granted by Euro-
peans that the shape of the
continents was fixed and

eternal, barring certain
trivial changes produced by
storms.

In 1756, however, a
French geologist, Nicolas
Desmarest (1725-1815),
pointed out the similarities
of the channel shores of En-
gland and France and sug-
gested that there had been
a land bridge between
them once, a bridge now

covered by the sea. (In
time, he was proved cor-
rect.) This was the first indi-
cation that continents
might shift and change
shape. Desmarest thought
such changes were brought
about by earthquakes,
which was not a bad idea,
but it was wrong.

 

1758

 

Halley’'s Comet

A little over half a century
before, Halley had pre-
dicted that the comet of

1682 would return in 1758
(see 1705). The amateur as-
tronomer Johann Georg
Palitzsch (1723—1788) set
up his telescope and

trained it on the part of the
sky where the comet was ex-
pected to appear, if it did re-
turn. On December 25,
1758, he spotted it, and
once the news broke, profes-
sional astronomers zeroed
their instruments in upon
it. The comet has ever since
been known as Halley's
comet, or in line with the
conventions of the present
day, Comet Halley. Calculat-
ing backward, Hall

comet turned out to be the
one that appeared at the
time of the invasion of En-
gland by William of Nor-
mandy. It was also the
comet that Giotto painted
(see 1304).

The return of Halley's
comet suddenly made com-
ets the headliners of astron-
omy, and for several
decades it seemed that the
greatest feat any astrono-
mer could achieve was to
discover comets.

Flame Tests

It was always a difficult
task for chemists to distin-
guish one substance from
another when some clearly

ble property difference
(color, softness, and so on)
didn’te hemists then
had to test for more subtle
differences.

A new test that pro-
duced something clear
visible to the eye was dis-
covered by a German chem-
ist, Andreas Sigismund
Marggraf (1709—1782), in
1758. Marggraf found that
sodium compounds turned
a flame yellow, while other-

ise very similar potas-

um compounds turned
it violet. (Of course, while
the compounds were

known, the elements so-
dium and potassium were
not to be isolated for half a
centur
This introduced the
flame test into chemistry.
Later, Cronstedt ( 751)
d the blowpipe,
ected a thin jet of
into a flame, making i
hotter and more effectively
heating minerals to pro-
duce delicate

chemists had to be
at blowpipe analy
expected to be succe:
research.

 
1759

 

Embryology

It was customary at this
time to think that seeds
and eggs (or pollen and
sperm) had miniature or-
ganisms in them that sim-
ply grew. Some even
thought that an organism
within an egg might have
eggs of its own with ultra-
miniature organisms
within and still smaller
eggs—and so on.

In 1759, however, the
German physiologist
Kaspar Friedrich Wolff
(1734—-1794) showed that
specialized organs devel-
oped out of unspecialized
tissue. Thus the tip of a
growing shoot consists of
undifferentiated and gener-
alized tissue. As it grows,
however, specialization de-
velops, and some bits of tis-
sue develop into flowers,
while other bits, originally

undistinguishable, develop
into leaves.

The same principle
could, and did, apply to ani-
mals, so that the idea of
miniature organisms in
eggs disappeared. Wolff is
considered another of the
founders of modern embry-
ology, in consequence.

 

1760

 

Earthquakes

Human beings have always
known about earthquakes
from sad and frightening
experience. What they
didn’t know was the cause.

Early theories attributed
them to the restlessness of
gods or demons imprisoned
underground. The ancient
Greek philosophers, in
search of a more rational
cause, supposed that there

might be pent-up air under-
ground, which occasion-
ally, in its attempt to
escape, shook the earth.
The Lisbon earthquake
of 1755 forced serious think-
ing on the matter. In 1760,
the English physicist John
Michell (1724—-1793) noted
that earthquakes frequently
appeared in volcanic areas.
He felt that underground
water might be boiled by
volcanic heat at times, and
that it was the imprisoned
steam that caused earth-
quakes.

Furthermore, he said,
the earthquakes set up
waves that traveled
through the Earth at some
measurable speed. If the
time at which waves
reached different points
were recorded, the point of
origin (or epicenter) of the
earthquake could be deter-
mined. Epicenters, he sug-
gested, could exist in the
rocks beneath the sea, and
it was one of these that had
destroyed Lisbon.

All of Michell’s ideas
were pretty sound, so that
he is known as the founder
of seismology.

Heat Capacity

Until this time it was as-
sumed that as more heat
poured into a substance, its

temperature rose steadily,
and that given quantities of
different materials all rose
in temperature at the same
rate. Why not? Heat was
considered a very subtle
fluid, and it made sense to
suppose that it filled all sub-
stances equally, so that all
given weights of substances
had the same capacity for
containing heat.

In 1760, however,
Black (see 1754) showed
that this notion, however
sensible it seemed, was
quite wrong. When he
heated equal weights of
mercury and water over the
same flame, the mercury’s
temperature went up twice
as fast as the water’s tem-
perature did. To Black, this
indicated that the heat ca-
pacity of mercury was less
than the heat capacity of
water, so that mercury was
more rapidly filled with
heat.

It followed that if equal
quantities of mercury and
water were lTli,\'Cd. \‘\'thC
mercury was at the higher
temperature, the final tem-
perature would not be pre-

cisely midway between but
would be below the mid-
point, because the quantity
of heat present in the mer-
cury and transferred to the
water would not fill the
water as much as it had the
mercury.

This started the scien-
tific study of heat, as dis-
tinct from temperature.

  

Pathology

In 1760 the Italian anato-
mist Giovanni Battista Mor-
gagni (1682-1771)
published a book in which
he described the 640 post-
mortems he had conducted
in his long life. He carefully
detailed the lives of his pa-
tients, the presence and de-
velopment of disease, and
the manner of dying and
tried to interpret every-
thing from the anatomical
point of view. As a result,
he is usually considered the
founder of modern pathol-
ogy.

 

 
 

1761

 

Venus’s
Atmosphere

Unlike the other planets,
Venus had no markings. It
always presented a feature-
less white orb. It remained
interesting, however, be-
cause periodically (being
closer to the Sun than
Earth is) it passed exactly
between Earth and Sun. On
such occasions, it appeared
as a small black sphere
moving across the face of
the Sun. This is called a
transit of Venus.

In 1761 there was a
transit of Venus coming
and astronomers organized
expeditions to Newfound-
land and to St. Helena to
observe it from widely sepa-
rated spots. If the exact
time at which Venus’s orb
first touched the Sun’s rim
and the exact time at which
it finally left on the other
side were determined from
those widely separated

spots, Venus's parallax
could be determined, and
its distance, together with
that of the Sun, might be
determined to a higher de-
gree of accuracy than was
produced by Cassini’s deter-
mination of the parallax of
Mars.

The expedition failed.
The time when Venus en-
tered and left the solar
sphere could not be deter-
mined accurately, to the
frustration of all.

One observer, the Rus-
sian scientist Mikhail Vasi-
lievich Lomenosov (1711—
1765), pointed out that this
could be due to Venus’s pos-
session of an atmosphere.
The atmosphere would fuzz
Venus's outline, so to
speak, and make the points
of contact difficult to time.
Furthermore, if the atmo-
sphere had a permanent
cloud layer, that would
help explain both Venus's
brilliance (since the cloud
layer would reflect most of

the sunlight striking it) and
its featurelessness.

Percussion

Methods for medical diag-
noses were not many in
these days. In 1761, how-
ever, an Austrian physician,
Leopold Auenbrugger von
Auenbrugg (1722-1809),
published a book entitled
Inventum novum (A New [n-
vention) in which he
pointed out that tapping
the body, especially the
chest area, and listening to
the sound produced would
give some indication of cer-
tain disorders of the inter-
nal organs. (He checked
this by comparing the
sounds he elicited with the
state of the organs as re-
vealed by postmortems.)

It took forty years, how-
ever, before this diagnostic
method became common in
medicine.

 
 

1762

 

Latent Heat

Black (see 1754) found in
1762 that if a mixture of ice
and water was heated, the
heat was absorbed but the
temperature did not
change. All the heat went
toward melting the ice into
water, the water being at
the same temperature as

ice but containing more
heat. The same happened
to an even greater extent
when water was boiled into
vapor.

Black called this latent
heat (from a Latin word for
“hidden’), since the heat
was there but did not make
itself apparent in the form
of temperature. The latent

heat was not lost, of course,
for when water vapor was
condensed to water, or
water was frozen to ice, the
latent heat was given off
again.

An understanding of la-
tent heat was important in
the improvement of the
steam engine a few years
later.

 

1763

 

Pollination

The existence of sexuality
in plants must have seemed
strange, since plants, being
essentially immobile, can-
not indulge in the kind of
sex that animals do.

In 1763, however, a
German botanist, Josef
Gottlieb Kohlreuter (1733

1806), pointed out the man-
ner in which plant pollen
can be blown by the wind
to reach female organs in a
purely random manner. Be-
cause of this randomness,
plants that depend on wind
pollination must produce
pollen in vast amounts.

He also pointed out
that a more efficient pro-

cess is to have bees or other
similar animals do the job.
A bee enters a flower in
search of nectar (the bribe
to make it enter). Pollen
coats the bee's fuzzy cov-
ering, and when the bee vis-
its the next flower, that
pollen rubs off on the pistil.
1764

 

Steam Engine

For half a century, the New-
comen steam engine had
been used by miners de-
spite its inefficiency. In
1764, a steam engine of this
sort was given to a Scottish
engineer, James Watt
(1736-1819), to repair.

The repair was easy,
but Watt wanted to im-

prove it. He had learned of
latent heat from his friend
Black (see 1762), and he re-
alized how wasteful it was
to keep heating, cooling,
and reheating the same
chamber. The thought
came to him, then, of hav-
ing two chambers. One
would always be kept hot
and the other would always
be kept cold. While the

steam was doing its work,
it would be in the hot cham-
ber, and when it had to be
condensed, a system of
valves would bleed it into
the cold chamber for con-
densation while more
steam was formed in the
hot chamber. That was the
beginning of the first rea-
sonably efficient steam en-
gine.
1765

 

Plutonism

The French geologist Nico-
las Desmarest (see 1756)
was interested in the
changes taking place on the
face of the Earth. He was
the first to maintain that
valleys had been formed by
the streams that ran
through them.

In 1765 he carried for-

ward the ideas of Guettard
(see 1752). Not only did he
maintain that heat was the
source of change, but he
saw it as having been ap-
plied through volcanic ac-
tion. He maintained that
basalt was a rock of volca-
nic origin and that large
sections of France’s rocks
consisted of ancient lava
flows. He was a Plutonist, in

other words (from the
Greek god Pluto who was
lord of the underworld).
However, most geologists
remained under the spell of
a German geologist, Abra-
ham Gottlob Werner
(1750-1817), who was a
Neptunist (see 1752) and in-
sisted that water was the
source of all change in the
Earth's surface.

 

1766

 

Hydrogen

Black’s work with carbon
dioxide (see 1754) had led
to great interest in gases on
the part of chemists. In
1766 the British chemist
Henry Cavendish (1731-
1810) found that some met-
als, when acted on by acid,
liberated a gas that was
highly inflammable and

which he therefore called
fire air. (We now call the
gas hydrogen.)

Actually, early experi-
menters, notably Boyle (see
1661), had obtained the
gas, but Cavendish was the
first to study it carefully
and report on its proper-
ties, so he is usually given
the credit for having discov-
ered it.

Cavendish measured
the weight of particular vol-
umes of different gases in
order to determine their
densities. He found this
new gas to be only one-four-
teenth the density of air,
and no substance under or-
dinary conditions has ever
been found to be less dense.
Nerves

From Greek times, nerves
had been thought to be hol-
low tubes that carried some
sort of subtle fluid, perhaps
in analogy to veins and ar-
teries.

A Swiss physiologist,
Albrecht von Haller (1708—
1777), dismissed this possi-
bility and decided to reach
no decisions on nerves that
could not be demonstrated
by experiment. His experi-
mental work, which he pub-
lished in 1766, showed that

muscles were irritable; that
is, a slight stimulus to the
muscle would produce a
sharp contraction. He also
showed that a stimulus to a
nerve would produce a
sharp contraction in the
muscle to which it was
attached. The nerve was
the more irritable and re-
quired the smaller stimu-
lus.

Haller judged, there-
fore, that it was nervous
stimulation that controlled
muscular movement. He
also showed that the tissues

themselves do not experi-
ence a sensation but that
the nerves channel and
carry the impulses that pro-
duce the sensation.
Furthermore, Haller
showed that nerves all led
to the brain or to the spinal
cord, which were thus
clearly indicated as the cen-
ters of sense perception and
responsive action. For all
this, he is considered the
founder of modern neurol-

ogy.

 

1768

 

Spontaneous
Generation

A century before, Redi (see
1668) had shown that mag-
gots were not generated
spontaneously but were
born of the eggs of flies.
That might disprove the
spontaneous generation of
organisms large enough to
see, but since then, scien-
tists had learned of myri-
ads of microorganisms.

Could these arise through
spontaneous generation?
The British naturalist
John Turberville Needham
(1713—-1781) had placed
mutton broth in a glass con-
tainer, killed all microor-
ganisms by heating, and
then sealed the container.
He reported that a few days
later, the broth contained
numerous microorganisms
that must have developed
spontaneously. This experi-
ment, conducted in 1740,

seemed impressive, but
there was some suspicion
that he had not heated the
broth sufficiently and had
not managed to kill all the
microorganisms.

In 1768 the Italian biol-
ogist Lazzaro Spallanzani
(1729-1799) decided to re-
peat the experiment and
make sure. He boiled his so-
lution for one-half to three-
quarters of an hour, then
sealed the flask. No new mi-
croorganisms appeared
thereafter, though they did
appear if he boiled the solu-
tion for shorter periods.
The conclusion was
that there was no spontaie-
ous generation even for mi-
croorganisms.

Australia

Transits of Venus occur in
pairs, eight years apart,
with over a century be-
tween pairs. Since there
was one in 1761, there
would be another in 1769.
In 1768, therefore, the En-
glish navigator James Cook
(1728-1779), usually called
Captain Cook, was sent out
on a voyage to the Pacific
Ocean. He was to observe
the transit from the newly
discovered island of
Tahiti.

In the course of this
voyage, he was the first to
explore, thoroughly, the

shores of Australia and to
get an idea of its size
Though earlier explorers
had spied its shores, it was
Cook whose reports were
sufficiently detailed to
bring the land clearly to Eu-
ropean attention. For that
reason, he is usually consid-
ered the discoverer of Aus-
tralia. This, and two more
voyages in the years follow-
ing, made Cook the most fa-
mous navigator since
Magellan (see 1523). Cook
crisscrossed the Pacific
Ocean and finally demon-
strated that it had no sig-
nificant land areas in it.
With Australia, the last
major habitable land area
on Earth had been discov-
ered.

In the course of his voy-
ages, Cook made use of
Lind’s dietary discovery
(see 1747) and lost only one
man to scurvy.

Carbonated
Water

An English chemist, Joseph
Priestley (1733-1804), grew
interested in gases in 1768,
partly because he lived
next door to a brewery and
was able to make use of
quantities of the carbon di-
oxide generated in the
brewing process

He found that when he
dissolved some of the car-
bon dioxide in water (car-
bonated water), he created
what he considered a pleas-
antly tart and refreshing
drink, the one we call selt-
zer, or soda water, today.
Since it required only fla-
voring and sugar to pro-
duce soda pop, Priestley
may be viewed as the fa-
ther of today’s gigantic
soft-drink industry.

 
1769

 

Quantitative
Chemistry

Although Black had demon-
strated the usefulness of
quantitative measure-
ments in chemistry (see
1754), what made them an
integral part of the science
was the work of French
chemist Antoine-Laurent
Lavoisier (1743—1794), who
isuniversally considered the
father of modern chemistry.

There were at this time
some who still clung to the
Greek theory of elements
and their changeability.
They argued that if water
were boiled for a long time,
a sediment appeared, and
that this was clearly a con-
version of water into a kind
of earth, in line with Greek
thinking.

Lavoisier decided, in
1769, to test this matter. He
boiled water for 101 days in
a device that condensed the

water vapor and returned it
to the flask, so that no
water was lost in the pro-
cess. He weighed both
water and vessel before and
after the boiling.

Sediment did appear,
but the water did not
change its weight during
the boiling, so the sediment
wasn’t formed out of the
water. The flask itself, how-
ever, had lost an amount of
weight just equal to the
weight of the sediment. In
other words, the sediment
was material from the
glass, slowly etched away
by the hot water and precip-
itating in solid fragments.
Here was a clear-cut exam-
ple of the way in which ob-
servation, without
measurement, could be use-
less and misleading.

Spinning Frame

The textile industry was in-
creasingly important for

Great Britain, and any me-
chanical device that could
increase production would
add to the wealth of those
who owned the mills and
factories.

In 1769 an English in-
ventor, Richard Arkwright
(1732-1792), invented a
spinning frame: a mechani-
cal device that could pro-
duce cotton threads hard
enough and firm enough to
be used in textile manufac-
ture. The frame helped pro-
duce textiles not only faster
than handworkers could
but so simply that Ark-
wright could work with rel-
atively unskilled operators
who would do the work for
little money. Arkwright
died a millionaire, but at a
cost. Many were thrown
out of work by his inven-
tion and went hungry, be-
cause the government at
this time did not consider
itself responsible for the
welfare of its citizens.

 
1770

 

Nile River

The coasts of the continents
were relatively easy to ex-
plore, but the interior repre-
sented greater toil and
greater risks. This was par-
ticularly true of Africa. Its
shores had been the first to
be explored by the Portu-
guese explorers, but its inte-
rior was the last to be
brought into the light of
known geography, so that
for a long time it was
known as the Dark Conti-
nent.

Most paradoxical was
the matter of the Nile
River. On the banks of its
northernmost portion, one
of the two oldest civiliza-
tions of the world flour-
ished, yet neither the
Egyptians nor any of the
civilized people that fol-
lowed them had ever dis-
covered the source of the
Nile. This becomes less sur-
prising when it is under-
stood that the Nile is the
longest river in the world.
It flows in a fairly straight
line from south to north,
and the source is over 4,000
miles from the mouth. The
ancient Egyptians had
made their way upriver for
about 1,500 miles before
giving up the search.

In 1770, however, the
Scottish explorer James
Bruce (1730-1794) made
his way upstream to Khar-
toum in the Sudan. There
two rivers join, the White
Nile coming up from the
southwest and the Blue
Nile from the southeast.
Bruce followed the Blue
Nile and finally found its
source in Lake Tana in
what is now northwestern
Ethiopia.

This seemed at the
time to solve the problem
of the source of the Nile,
but the White Nile, being
the longer of the two, is the
main river, and its source
remained unknown for an-
other century.

Gulf Stream

There are currents in the
water that are as important
to navigation as the winds
are, though they are less no-
ticeable.

Franklin (see 1733) had
traveled from America to
Europe several times and
his ever-inquiring niind be-
came aware of the differ-
ence in speed in the two
directions. He was the first
to study ships’ reports seri-
ously and to query the expe-
rience of whalers. As a

result he found that there
was a current of warm
water coming up from the
Gulf of Mexico (the Gulf
Stream) and then crossing
the North Atlantic toward
Europe. It sped the ships
sailing eastward to Europe
and slowed those sailing
westward to North
America. Franklin mapped
it and in this way showed
British navigators the
routes to avoid if they
wished to make good time
westward. This was the be-
ginning of the scientific
study of ocean currents.

Water currents did not
concern only navigators.
Labrador and Great Britain
are at precisely the same
latitude on opposite sides
of the North Atlantic
Ocean. However, the Gulf
Stream, a warm-water cur-
rent, bathes the British
coasts, while a cold-water
current from the Arctic
bathes the Labrador coast.
For that reason, Great Brit-
ain has a mild climate and
is populated by tens of mil-
lions, while Labrador is
frigid and is populated by
tens of thousands.

 
Soluble Gases

Priestley (see 1768) was the
first to bubble gases into an
upside-down mercury-filled
vessel with its mouth in a

tub of mercury. In this way,
gases could be collected
that could not be collected
through water because they
dissolve in the water. By
1770 Priestley had collected

and studied the water-solu-
ble gases we know as am-
monia, sulfur dioxide, and
hydrogen chloride.

 

1771

 

Nebulas

The hungry search for com-
ets became so important to
some astronomers that it
seemed to consume them.
One such was the French as-
tronomer Charles Messier
(1730-1817), who discov-
ered twenty-one comets,
but who was depressed
whenever some other as-
tronomer discovered one he
had missed, or when he
was kept away from his
telescope as, for instance,
when his wife was on her
deathbed.

He was irritated by the
false hopes aroused by the
sighting of some fuzzy ob-
ject that turned out not to
be a comet but a nebulosity
fixed to some spot in the

heavens. In 1771 he pub-
lished a list of 45 of these
nebulas, which in later
years he expanded

to 103.

As it turned out, the
list of Messier objects
turned out to be far
grander and more im-
portant than comets, and
Messier would be com-
pletely forgotten now if his
comet discoveries were his
only accomplishment. It is
his list of things to be disre-
garded that has made his
name immortal, for it in-
cludes numerous star clus-
ters and distant galaxies.

Plants and
Carbon Dioxide

Carbon dioxide was well
known by this time to sup- l
port neither combustion
nor animal life. Priestley
(see 1768) thought of check-
ing to see whether plants,
as well as animals, were un-
able to live in carbon diox-
ide.
In 1771 he placed a lit
candle in an enclosed vol-
ume of air until the candle
would burn no more and
the air was filled with car-
bon dioxide. He then
placed a sprig of mint in a
glass of water and placed it
in the enclosed air.
The plant did not die.
It lived there for months
and seemed to flourish.
What was more, at the end
of that time, a mouse could
be put into that volume of
air and live—and a candle
would burn.

Whatever it was about
air that supported combus-
tion and animal life, and
1ha[ was CUH\'CI'[CL]. into car-
bon dioxide by burning can-
dles and breathing animals,

was restored by plant life.
This was the first indica-
tion that plants and ani-
mals formed a chemical
balance that kept Earth’s
atmosphere breathable.

 

1772

 

Combustion

Chemists’ understanding of
combustion at this time
was based on a theory first
propounded in 1700 by a
German chemist, George
Ernst Stahl (1660—1734).
He suggested that objects
that were combustible were
rich in something he called
phlogiston, from a Greek
word meaning “to set on
fire.”

In the process of com-
bustion, fuel lost its phlogis-
ton, and eventually a
residue was left that lacked
phlogiston and would not
burn. Stahl recognized that
rusting was comparable to
combustion. He believed
metals to be rich in phlogis-
ton and held that they grad-

ually lost it as they were
converted to rust.

The chief flaw in the
theory was that when wood
burned it lost much of its
weight (presumably be-
cause of the loss of phlogis-
ton), yet when iron rusted,
it gained weight. In Stahl’s
time, however, it wasn’t
considered important to
measure quantities exactly
and chemists ignored this
paradox.

Lavoisier (see 1769),
however, believed in
weighing. In 1772 he began
heating objects in enclosed
volumes and weighing that
volume. For instance, he
burned certain elements in
air and found that the mate-
rial produced was heavier
than the elements them-

 

 

selves, though nothing
within the container had
changed weight at all. If
the elements gained weight
in burning, then something
else must have lost weight,
and the only something else
this could be was the en-
closed air. If some of the air
had been absorbed by the
burning elements, there
should be a partial vacuum
in the flask. Lavoisier
opened the flask, and sure
enough, air rushed in. The
added weight of the in-
rushing air was equal to

the weight gained by the el-
ement that had been
burned.

By such experiments,
Lavoisier concluded that
combustion did not come
about through the loss of

 

  
  
phlogiston, but through the
combination of the sub-
stance that was burning or
rusting with some portion
of the air. This killed the
phlogiston theory, although
a few important chemists
continued to accept phlogis-
ton for some decades
longer.

Diamond

One of the substances that
Lavoisier burned (see
above) was a diamond. He
and some other chemists in-
vested in one, placed it in a
closed vessel, and then fo-
cused sunlight on it with a
magnifying glass. The dia-
mond, when it grew hot
enough, simply disap-

peared, and carbon dioxide
appeared within the vessel.
The conclusion was that di-
amond consisted of carbon
and, despite appearances,
was chemically very closely
related to coal.

Nitrogen

At this time it was known
that ordinary air supported
combustion and animal life
and that carbon dioxide did
not. If candles were burned
in an enclosed volume of
air until no further burning
was possible, had all the air
become carbon dioxide?
Black (see 1754) asked
a student of his, the British
chemist Daniel Rutherford
(1749-1819), to investigate

the matter. In 1772 Ruther-
ford, having burned a can-
dle to extinction in a closed
container, absorbed all the
carbon dioxide that had
been produced by combin-
ing it with certain chemi-
cals. He found that there
was still a great deal of gas
left that was not carbon di-
oxide, which also sup-
ported neither combustion
nor animal life. He had, in
this way, discovered a new
gas that eventually came to
be called nitrogen. This is
from the Greek, meaning
“niter producer,” since
niter, a mineral properly
called potassium nitrate,
contains nitrogen.

 

1773

 

Antarctic Circle

The Arctic Circle was first
crossed at sea by Ottar (see
870), though unnamed
primitives must surely
have ventured past it on

land earlier. However, the
Arctic Circle passes
through northern North
America, Europe, and Asia,
and once the glaciers had
retreated, the line was open
to venturesome hunters.

The Antarctic Circle,
however, lies far to the
south of any populated
area. The closest is Tierra
del Fuego at the southern
tip of South America,
which even at its most
southerly is still about 650
miles north. It is safe to
say, then, that no human
being, primitive or civi-
lized, had ever crossed the
Antarctic Circle prior to
1773

In that year, Captain
Cook, on his second voyage
through the Pacific in
search of an important land
area, ventured far to the
south and on January 17 (at
the height of the Antarctic
summer) crossed the Ant-
arctic Circle, a true first for
humanity.

Bacilli

Bacteria had just barely
been made out by Leecuwen-
hoek nearly a century be-
fore (see 1683). Since then,
microscopists had not been
able to do more than just
barely see them. In 1773,
however, a Danish biolo-
gist, Otto Friedrich Muller
(1730-1784), managed to
make them out well enough
to divide them into catego-
ries. Some looked like little
rods and he called them ba-
cilli (from a Latin word for

“little rod"); some were
curved into spiral shapes
and he called them spirilla.

He was the first to clas-
sify microorganisms gener-
ally into genera and species
after the fashion of Lin-
naeus (see 1735), but even
he couldn’t do very much
with the tiny specks that
were bacteria.

 

1774

 

Oxygen

Priestley worked with mer-
cury in his collection of
gases (see 1770) and could
not help using it more di-
rectly in his experiments.
Mercury, when heated in
air, will form a brick-red
compound, which we now
call mercuric oxide. Priest-

ley heated some of this com-
pound in a test-tube by
using a lens to concentrate
sunlight upon it. When he
did this, the compound
broke up, liberating mer-
cury, which appeared as
shining globules in the
upper portion of the test-
tube.

In addition, a gas was

given off that possessed
most unusual properties.
Combustibles burned more
brilliantly and rapidly in it
than they did in ordinary
air. Mice placed in an atmo-
sphere of this gas were par-
ticularly frisky, and
Priestley himself felt
and easy'’ when he
breathed it.

light
 

 

When Lavoisier heard
of the experiments of Priest-
ley and of Rutherford (see
1772), he realized in the
light of his own experi-
ments that air must consist
of a mixture of two gases:
one-fifth was Priestley’s
gas, which Lavoisier named
oxygen (from Greek words
meaning “acid producer,”
because it was mistakenly
felt at the time that all
acids contained oxygen),
and four-fifths were Ruther-
ford’s gas, which Lavoisier
named azote (from Greek
words meaning ‘‘no life”),
but which later came to be
known as nitrogen.

Clearly, it was oxygen
that supported combustion
and animal life and oxygen
that was involved in rust-
ing. Animals must consume
oxygen and produce carbon
dioxide, and from Priest-
ley’s earlier experiment
(see 1771), plants must con-
sume carbon dioxide and
produce oxygen. Between
these two forms of life, the
atmosphere’s makeup re-
mained stable.

Chlorine

In a classic case of scientific
misfortune, the Swedish
chemist Carl Wilhelm
Scheele (1742-1786) had
discovered oxygen at least
two years before Priestley
did, and by the same
method. However,
Scheele’s discovery was not

published (through the neg-
ligence of a publisher) until
after Priestley’s discovery
had been reported, so
Priestley gets the credit.

Scheele, however, dis-
covered many simple com-
pounds from plants and
animals, to say nothing of
such poisonous gases as hy-
drogen fluoride, hydrogen
sulfide, and hydrogen cya-
nide. He was also involved
in the discovery of a num-
ber of elements, though he
never managed to get undis-
puted credit for a single
one of them.

Thus, by 1774 he had
done most of the spade-
work that led to the discov-
ery of the element
manganese. His friend, the
Swedish mineralogist
Johan Gottlieb Gahn
(1745-1818), however, took
the final step and gets
credit for the discovery.

Also in 1774, Scheele
isolated the gas chlorine,
which was unusual in not
being colorless. Chlorine is
greenish-yellow in color,
and its name, in fact, is de-
rived from the Greek word
for “green.” The trouble
was that Scheele did not
recognize chlorine to be an
element but thought it was
a combination of some sub-
stance with oxygen. Chlo-
rine was found to be an
element about thirty years
later, and it was to that
finder that credit for the dis-
covery was awarded.

Mind and
Disease

Throughout history, dis-
eases had been cured (so it
was said) by various mystic
rites, by the laying on of
hands, the saying of pray-
ers, and so on.

In 1774 the German
physician and mystic Franz
Anton Mesmer (1734-1815)
began to apply science to
this by waving magnets
over his patients, and ef-
fecting cures in some cases.
Later, he discovered that
magnets were unnecessary
and that the same happy re-
sults could be achieved by
simply passing hands over
the patient. He claimed to
be making use of animal
magnetism.

Naturally, in some
cases he did not effect a
cure, and he was driven out
of Vienna, where he first
practiced, as a quack. He
went to Paris, where again
he was first popular and
then forced to leave. His
methods were examined by
such men as Franklin and
Lavoisier.

Franklin, for one, al-
though he condemned Mes-
mer’s mysticism,
recognized that the mind
influenced the body: that it
could cause disorders and
that it could be used to cor-
rect them.

What Mesmer was deal-
ing with (without under-
standing it as well as
Franklin did) were psycho-
somatic ailments, where
often it is only necessary
for patients to believe they

Digitalis

The earliest medicines were
those obtained from plants
of various sorts, and we
have records of these
herbal remedies from as far
back as Dioscorides (see
50). In early modern times,
physicians tended to scorn
plant products, especially
since those who knew most
about such herbal remedies

will be cured in order to be
cured. M 's methods,

their mumbo jumbo, be-

1776

 

Races

Europeans were always
aware that groups of people
differed generally in ap-
pearances. The dark Medi-
terranean people were
aware that the Germanic
peoples were generally
taller and blonder. Europe-
ans noted the short height
and oddly shaped eyelids of
Asian invaders such as
Huns and Mongols, and
from ancient times they
knew of the dark-hued Afri-
cans.

The first orderly classi-
fication of these varieties
came in 1776, when a Ger-
man anthropologist, Jo-
hann Friedrich

Blumenbach (1752—1840),
divided the human species
into five races: Caucasian
(Europeans), Mongolian
(East Asians), Malayan
(Southeast Asians and Pa-
cific Islanders), Ethiopians
(sub-Saharan Africans), and
Americans (Native Ameri-
cans). A more unsophisti-
cated way of dividing them
is to call them, respec-
tively: the White, Yellow,
Brown, Black, and Red
races.

The fact remains,
though, that all human be-
ings, however superficially
different in appearance
they may be, are members
of a single species and can
freely interbreed. There is

no indication that there is
any important difference be-
tween any of these groups,
either physical, mental, or
psychological.
Blumenbach's divi-
sions were far too general
and simplistic, for each
group can be divided into
subgroups, and the Native
Australians are left out alto-
gether. Blumenbach's focus
on superficial differences of
skin color, hair form, and
eyelid shape merely served
to make it easier to express
racist views in scientific-
sounding language. The
dark evils of slavery and of
ethnic persecutions were
thus made to sound lofty
and biologically inevitable.

 
1777

 

Torsion Balance

From time immemorial,
people had used two pans
at equal distances from a
fulerum to weigh things
(see 5000 B.c.). The object
to be weighed was placed
in one pan and weights

were added to the other till
the pans were in balance.
In fact, the instrument was
called a balance.

In 1777, however, the
French physicist Charles-
Augustin de Coulomb
(1736—1806) showed that it
took a certain amount of

force to twist (that is, to
apply torsion to) a fiber or a
wire, and that the amount of
torsion was proportional to
the amount of force. Since
weight is a force, such a tor-
sion balance could be used

 

1778

 

Molybdenum

Scheele, using methods that
had worked in isolating
manganese (see 1774), man-
aged to isolate another
metal, molybdenum. With
his usual incredible run of
bad luck, Scheele often loses
the credit for the discovery,
whichis given to another
friend of his, the Swedish
mineralogist Peter Jacob
Hjelm (1746—-1813).

Hawaiian
Islands

Captain Cook, in his final
voyage, explored the Pacific
coast of North America
north of California. This
formed the basis for the
later British claim to the re-
gion. In January 1778 he dis-
covered the Hawaiian
Islands, which he named
the Sandwich Islands after

John Montagu, fourth earl
of Sandwich (1718—1792).
The earl of Sandwich
was such an inveterate gam-
bler that he had meat
placed between two slices of
bread so that he could eat
with one hand and not be
forced to leave the
table. It was in this way that
the sandwich was invented.
He was also one of the gr

Fertilization

In early times, it was taken
for granted that male
human beings provided the
“seed” and that females
were merely the soil within
which the seed developed.
If no children were born, it
was assumed that the
woman involved, like de-
sert soil, was “barren.”

In 1779 Spallanzani
(see 1768) studied the devel-
opment of eggs. At that
time, it was thought that
the ovarian follicles (discov-
ered by the Dutch anato-
mist Reinier de Graaf
[1641-1673] in 1673 and
still called Graafian follicles
as a result) were the eggs.

Spallanzani showed
that fertilization did not
take place unless the sperm
cells in the semen actually
made physical contact with
the follicles. This was a
strong indication that re-
production was not a one-
sided affair, but that both
mother and father contrib-
uted to the birth of a child
and that either side might
be at fault in case children
were not born.

Photosynthesis

Joseph Priestley had shown
that plants could make air
breathable after it had been
filled with carbon dioxide
(see 1771).In 1779 a Dutch

physician, Jan Ingenhousz
(1730-1799), repeated the
experiments and confirmed
Priestley’s findings. His cru-
cial added discovery, how-
ever, was that plants
consumed carbon dioxide
and produced oxygen only
in the light. In the dark,
plants, like animals, con-
sumed oxygen and pro-
duced carbon dioxide.

Because of the impor-
tance of light, and because
plants in the process pro-
duced not only light but
also the large molecules of
their tissues, the process
came to be called photosyn-
thesis, from Greek words
meaning “to put together
by light.”

Electrical
Stimulation

An Italian anatomist, Luigi
Galvani (1737—1798), no-
ticed in 1780 that the mus-
cles of dissected frog legs
twitched wildly when

struck them

too surprising. Electric
shocks made living muscles
twitch, why not dead ones,
too?

Since Franklin had
shown that lightning was
electrical in nature

whether muscles would

The Industrial Revolution and the Early
19th Century (1781—1850)

The year 1781, when James
Watt made a steam engine
capable of turning a wheel,
marked a new era. Steam-
generated power meant
that machines no longer
had to be tied to natural en-
ergy sources like wind and
flowing water. And with ro-
tary motion, engines could
now be used to improve the
speed and efficiency of
many types of machines.
Factories were built and
the size of machines in-
creased, as did the scale of
production. More and more
people left rural areas and
agricultural pursuits to
work in growing urban cen-
ters. Another key area of
technological advance was
transportation, which in
turn supported industry by
more quickly moving
greater numbers of people,
goods, and supplies than
ever before. Great strides
were made in the develop-
ment of electricity. In 1800
Alessandro Volta created a
primitive battery. The phe-

nomenon of electromagne-
tism was discovered in
1820 when scientists saw
that wires carrying an elec-
tric current had magnetic
properties. Probing for
more knowledge about the
phenomenon, Michael Fara-
day showed that electrical
forces could produce mo-
tion and create lines of
force. Electricity was put in
the service of chemistry
when Humphry Davy
passed an electric current
through compounds that
could not be broken up by
other means, isolating for
the first time the elements
sodium, potassium, bar-
ium, strontium, calcium,
and magnesium; this was
the beginning of electro-
chemistry. Chemistry con-
tinued to be an area of
great achievement. In 1789
Antoine Lavoisier formu-
lated the law of conserva-
tion of mass, and in 1799
Joseph-Louis Proust stated
the law of definite propor-
tions, allowing chemists to

distinguish between mix-
tures and compounds,
When he proposed his
atomic theory in 1803, John
Dalton improved on the
Greeks’ idea that all matter
was composed of tiny, indi-
visible particles by intro-
ducing the concept of
atomic weight. In 1811
Amedeo Avogadro came up
with the hypothesis that all
gases at the same volume,
pressure, and temperature
were made up of the same
number of particles; in the
process he coined the word
molecules to describe the
combinations of atoms that
made up a gas. In physics
some of the most important
work focused on the nature
of heat and its conversion
into other forms of energy.
In 1847 Hermann von
Helmholtz enunciated the
first law of thermodynam-
ics—that the total amount
of energy in the Universe is
constant. In 1848 Baron
Kelvin established the con-
cept of absolute zero and in-
troduced a scale of
temperature beginning at
that point. The second law
of thermodynamics, de-
scribed in 1850 by Rudolf
Clausius, stated that not all
energy is equally useful and

1781

that the amount of avail-
able energy in the Universe
is constantly decreasing.
Three innovations of this
period improved communi-
cations worldwide, much
as the invention of the al-

phabet and printing had
done—the metric system,
the system devised to repre-
sent the names of the chem-
ical elements, and
telegraphic communica-
tion.

 

Uranus

Since prehistoric times,
human beings had been
aware of the five bright star-
like planets: Mercury,
Venus, Mars, Jupiter, and
Saturn. With the coming of
Copernican principles (see
1543), Earth itself became a
sixth, coming between
Venus and Mars. It seemed
somehow impossible that
there could be another.
Surely, if there were an-
other, it would have been
seen.

In the 1770s, a British
astronomer (of Hanoverian
birth) began studying the
heavens. He was William
Herschel (1738-1822). A
music teacher by profes-
sion, he had grown inter-
ested in astronomy. Unable
to buy a telescope he con-
sidered sufficiently good, he
took to grinding his own
lenses and mirrors and
ended with the best tele-
scopes of his time.

He determined to
study, systematically, ev-

erything in the sky, and on
March 31, 1781, he came
across an object that ap-
peared as a disc instead of
as a mere point of light. He
supposed it to be a comet,
but the disc had sharp
edges like a planet and
wasn't fuzzy as a comet
would be. Furthermore,
when enough observations
had been made to calculate
an orbit, he found that
orbit to be nearly circular,
like a planet’s, and not elon-
gated, like a comet's.
What’s more, it was clear
that the object’s orbit lay
far outside that of Saturn.
It was twice as far from the
Sun as Saturn was, and no
comet could be seen from
that distance.

The conclusion was
that Herschel had discov-
ered a seventh planet cir-
cling the Sun, which
because of its great dis-
tance did not appear as
bright as the others. In fact,
it was visible to the un-
aided eye as a very dim star
and had been observed a

number of times by people
who never suspected it
might be a planet. The first
had been Flamsteed (see
1676), who had recorded its
position on his star map a
century earlier and called it
34 Tauri.

After some hesitation,
astronomers decided to con-
tinue naming planets for
mythelogical characters,
and the new planet was
named Uranus, after the fa-
ther of Saturn (Cronos) in
the Greek myths.

The discovery of Ura-
nus doubled the size of the
Solar System at a stroke. It
was further spectacular
proof that the ancients had
not known everything, and
gave astronomers the excit-
ing knowledge that there
was more to be discovered
in the sky than additional
comets.

.
Binary Stars
Astronomers were still try-
ing to detect the parallax of
the stars, the task that

 
 

 

Bradley had failed at a
half-century earlier (see
1728).

It struck Herschel (see
above) that he might be
able to detect parallax if he
studied stars that were very
close together in appear-
ance. Both would be in the
same line of sight, but if
one was considerably
brighter than the other, it
might be considerably
closer. In that case, the
brighter star should show
slight parallactic changes
of position in the course of
the year relative to the dim
star.

Herschel began the
study of such stars in 1781,
and as time went on, he did
notice that one of the stars
changed position relative to
the other in a number of
cases. In no case, however,
was this change quite what
one would expect if it had
resulted from the motion of
the Earth. In time, astrono-
mers were forced to the con-
clusion that some double
stars were actually close to
each other in reality and
not merely in appearance
and that they moved about
each other. Herschel had
discovered binary stars, from
a Latin word referring to
objects that exist in pairs.

Newton had presented
his law of universal gravita-
tion, assuming that it was a
force of attraction between
any two objects in the Uni-

verse, but it had actually
been tested only on objects
within the Solar System.
Now for the first time it
could be tested on distant
stars, where it was eventu-
ally proved to be truly uni-
versal.

Crystallography

Crystal is from a Greek
word for “ice” or “frozen.”
Since ice is sometimes
transparent, the word crys-
tal came to be used for any
transparent object. Thus, a
fortune-teller uses a “crys-
tal ball” that is a ball of or-
dinary glass. The planets
were thought to be set in
“crystalline spheres” be-
cause those spheres were
transparent.

When quartz was
found, it had the properties
of rocky material, but it
was transparent. Since bits
of quartz often had straight
edges, planar faces, and
sharp angles, people began
to speak of any solids with
straight edges, planar faces,
and sharp angles as crys-
tals, even when they were
not transparent.

In 1781, a French min-
eralogist, René-Just Hatiy
(1743-1822), was handling
a piece of calcite crystal
that had a rhombohedral
shape (a kind of slanted
cube). Accidentally, he
dropped it and it shattered.
Haiiy noticed that the

pieces all had a rhombohe-
dral shape. He broke more
pieces of calcite and found
that, no matter what the
original shape was, it broke
into rhombohedrals.

Haty suggested that
each crystal was built of
successive additions of
what we now call a unit
cell, which formed, in the
absence of external interfer-
ence, a simple geometrical
shape with constant angles.
He felt that an identity or
difference in crystalline
form implied an identity or
difference in chemical com-
position.

In this way, Hatiy
founded the modern sci-
ence of crystallography.

Axial Inclination
of Mars

The Earth’s axis is tipped
23.5 degrees to the perpen-
dicular of the plane of its
orbit. It is this which gives
Earth its seasons. When the
Earth is in that region of its
orbit in which its North
Pole is tipped toward the
Sun, the northern hemi-
sphere has its summer and
the southern its winter.
When the Earth is in the op-
posite region of its orbit,
with the North Pole tipped
away from the Sun, the
northern hemisphere has
its winter and the southern
its summer.
Do other planets have
similar characteristics?
Herschel (see Binary Stars,
above) was studying the ro-
tation of Mars—the man-
ner in which its markings
moved about it, which Cas-
sini had used to determine
the length of the Martian
day (see 1665). It seemed to
Herschel that the markings
had to move parallel to the
Martian equator and that
its axis of rotation would
have to be perpendicular to
that. By determining the
axis of rotation in this way,
Herschel calculated that
Mars had an axial inclina-
tion of just about 24 de-
grees, nearly that of
Earth's. This was one more
way in which Earth resem-
bled other planets.

Steam Engine

Since Watt had thought of
having a hot and a cold
chamber in a steam engine

(see 1764), he kept introduc-
ing improvements. He ar-
ranged to have the steam
push into a chamber on
each side of the piston alter-
nately so that it would be
pushed rapidly in both di-
rections rather than in only
one.

In 1781 he devised me-
chanical attachments that
ingeniously converted the
back-and-forth movement
of a piston into the rotary
movement of a wheel, so
that the steam engine could
be made to power a variety
of activities and machines.

The now-versatile
steam engine was the first
of the modern prime mov-
ers, the first modern device,
that is, that could take en-
ergy as it occurred in na-
ture and apply it to the
driving of machinery. To be
sure, wind and running
water were the prime mov-
ers of ancient times, but
wind is erratic, and run-

ning water only exists in
certain places, The use of
fuel is certain; it ahways con-

 

tains energy. What's more,
it can be used anywhere
and in any quantity within
reason.

The steam engine,
bringing the use of ener
to all mechanical devic
far greater quantity than
anything else had offered in
the past was the key to all
that followed rapidly under
the name of the Industrial
Revolution, when the face of
the world was changed as
drastically (and far more
rapidly) than at any time
since the invention of agri-
culture, nearly ten thou-
sand years before (see
8000 B.C.).

(1611~1687).

Another variable star
was noted in 1672 by an
[talian astronomer, Gemi-
niano Mantanari (1633—
1687). That was Beta Per-
sei, better known as Algol
(from an Arabic word mean-
ing “the ghoul,” because it
represented the head of the
monster Medusa in the con-

stellation). Algol did not
vary in brightness as much
as Mira did, but Algol's
variations, unlike Mira's,
were quite regular.

In 1782 Algol was stud-
ied by a British astrono-
mer, John Goodricke
(1764—1786), a deaf-mute.
To account for the regular-
ity of Algol’s variations, he
suggested that it might

have a dim companion that
circled it in our line of sight
and periodically eclipsed it,
hiding most of the light.

In this, he proved to be
perfectly right, but not all
variable stars are eclipsing
variables. Mira isn't. Its
variations are so irregular
that no eclipse can possibly
be involved.

 

1783

 

Motion of
the Sun

To the ancients, the Earth
was the motionless center
of the Universe. To the
early moderns, the Sun
was.

In 1783, however, Her-
schel began a systematic
measurement of the proper
motion (see 1781) of a great
many stars. Very dim and
very distant stars moved so
slightly they could be con-
sidered motionless and

were references against
which the perceptible mo-
tions of the nearer stars
could be measured.

As the years passed,
Herschel found that in one
direction in the sky, the
stars were generally mov-
ing away from each other,
while in the opposite direc-
tion they were very slowly
closing in toward each
other. In 1805 he came to
the conclusion that this
could best be explained by
supposing that the Sun it-
self was moving toward

that point from which stars
seemed to be separating
and was moving away from
the point toward which
other stars s
converging.

Just as Copernicus (see
1543) had maintained that
the Earth was a planet like
other planets, moving as
they did, so Herschel now
maintained that the Sun
was a star like other stars
and was moving as they
did.

But if neither the Earth
nor the Sun was the mo-

eemed to be

 
 

 

tionless center of the Uni-
verse, what was? There was
no other candidate, and the
question had to remain in
abeyance for a time.

Respiration
and
Combustion

Lavoisier, having worked
out his theory of combus-
tion as the combination of
fuels with oxygen from the
air (see 1772), thought of
respiration. Animals ate
food that contained carbon.
They breathed air that con-
tained oxygen and exhaled
air that contained less oxy-
gen and more carbon diox-
ide.

In collaboration with a
French scientist, Pierre-
Simon de Laplace (1749—
1827), Lavoisier undertook
a series of experiments de-
signed to measure the
amount of heat and carbon
dioxide produced by a
guinea pig. It turned out
that the amount of heat
was about what would be
expected from the produc-
tion of that much carbon
dioxide, and Lavoisier
concluded that respiration
was a form of combustion.

The essential point was
that the laws that governed
combustion outside the
body seemed to hold inside
the body as well. This was
another blow against vi-

talism, the system of
thought that gave life spe-
cial status.

Balloon

Light objects can be borne
on the air, as all of us ob-
serve in the case of small
feathers, dandelion seeds,
and so on. If objects are
light enough, they needn’t
depend on wind and up-
drafts to remain in the air
(or on muscular power as
in the case of birds, bats,
and insects). A light enough
object can actually float in
air, just as wood floats on
water.

There are no known
solids or liquids that are
lighter than air, but some
gases are. It occurred to
two French brothers,
Joseph-Michel Montgolfier
(1740-1810) and Jacques-
Etienne Montgolfier (1745—
1799), that hot air ex-
panded and was therefore
lighter than an equal vol-
ume of cold air. If a quan-
tity of hot air filled a light
balloon, the hot air would
float in the air and might
have enough upward push
to carry the balloon with it.
In fact, if the balloon was
large enough, there might
be sufficient buoyancy to
carry a human being up-
ward.

On June 5, 1783, in the
marketplace of their home-
town, the brothers filled a

large linen bag, 35 feet in di-
ameter, with hot air. It
lifted 1,500 feet upward
and floated a distance of a
mile and a half in 10 min-
utes. They went to Paris,
and on September 19, they
managed a flight of 6 miles
before a crowd of three hun-
dred thousand that in-
cluded Benjamin Franklin.
The balloon carried up
not only itself but a wicker
basket in which were a
rooster, a duck, and a
sheep, which were not
harmed. Finally, on Novem-
ber 20, a hot-air balloon
carried into the air a
French physicist, Jean Fran-
cois Pilatre de Rozier
(1756—1783), and a compan-
ion. They were the first
aeronauts in history.
Meanwhile, a French
physicist, Jacques-Alex-
andre-César Charles (1746—
1823), having heard of the
hot-air balloons, realized
that hot air had compara-
tively little buoyancy and
lost that little as it cooled,
though a fire in the basket
underneath might suffice to
keep it warm for a while.
The gas hydrogen, studied
by Cavendish (see 1766),
was much lighter than hot
air and had much greater
buoyancy. What's more, the
buoyancy was permanent.
On August 27, 1783,
Charles constructed the
first hydrogen balloon and
subsequently used one to

 
rise nearly 2 miles in the
air.

In subsequent decades,
ballooning became almost
a craze, and it was also
used for scientific purposes.

Tungsten

A Spanish mineralogist,
Don Fausto D’Eluyar
(1755-1833), analyzed a

1784

mineral called wolframite,
which had been obtained
from a tin mine, and in
1783 he obtained a new
metal from it, which he
called wolfram. The same
metal is also called tung-
sten from the Swedish
words meaning “‘heavy
stone.” That word derives
from Scheele (see 1774),
who investigated tungsten-

containing minerals but
with his usual bad luck,
missed spotting the new
metal.

 

 

 

 

Volcanoes

In 1783 a volcanco in Ice-
land erupted and killed
one-fifth of the population
of the island. That winter
there was severe cold, and
in 1784 Benjamin Franklin
suggested that there might
be a connection between
the two events. Volcanic
ash shot high into the atmo-
sphere might reflect an ab-

normally high percentage
of the Sun'’s radiation, put-

ting the Earth in the shade,

so to speak, and cooling it.
This was the first specula-
tion on a phenomenon that

would be in the news begin-
ning in the 1980s as nuclear

winter.

Bifocal Lenses

Also in 1784, Franklin, who
in his old age needed two
sets of spectacles, one for
distant vision and one for
reading, grew tired of
changing them frequently.
He devised bifocc
cles, the lenses of which

 

 

were suited for distant vi
sion above and near vision
(reading) below
Hydrogen and
Water

On January 15, 1784, Cav-
endish, still studying hydro-
gen (see 1766), noted that if
it was burned in a con-
tainer, liquid drops ap-
peared in the cooler
portions of that container.
On investigation, the liquid
turned out to be water. The
conclusion was that hydro-
gen combined with oxygen
to form water. When Lavoi-
sier heard that, he gave the
gas its present name of hy-
drogen, from Greek words
meaning “‘water-former.”

>
Martian Ice
Caps
In 1784 Herschel, who had
determined the axial incli-
nation of Mars (see 1781)

and therefore knew where
its polar regions were, no-
ticed that it had visible ice
caps in those polar regions.
Here was another similar-
ity between Mars and
Earth.

Alaska

After Bering's discovery of
the Bering Strait (see 1728),
Russians from Siberia, ven-
turing eastward, found
large numbers of sea otters,
whose pelts proved very
profitable. In 1784 the Rus-
sians established the first
European settlement in
Alaska, and for the next
eighty years Russian hold-
ings expanded until all of
the present-day state of
Alaska was part of the Rus-
sian Empire.

Tellurium

An Austrian mineralogist,
Franz Joseph Muller (1740—
1825), was working with
gold ore in 1782. In his stud-
ies, he produced a sub-
stance that he thought
might be an as-yet-un-
known element. Feeling un-
equal to the task of settling
the matter, he sent the sub-
stance to a German chem-
ist, Martin Heinrich
Klaproth (1743—1817), for
investigation. In 1784 Klap-
roth confirmed that the
material was a new ele-
ment, named it tellurium
(from a Latin word for
“earth”), and was careful to
give [ull credit for the dis-
covery to Muller.

 
1785

 

Clusters and
Nebulas

William Herschel (see 1781)
studied the various fuzzy
objects that Messier had
listed (see 1771) and found,
in 1785, that some of them
were not nebulas but clus-
ters of stars, densely
packed (at least by the stan-
dard of our own uncrowded
stellar neighborhood) into a
roughly spherical shape.
We call them globular clus-
ters now and know that
some consist of hundreds of
thousands of stars.

There were some nebu-
las that Herschel couldn't
resolve into constituent
stars. He wondered, like Im-
manuel Kant (see 1755), if
they might not be large col-
lections of stars too far off
to resolve.

In addition, he discov-
ered dark areas in the
Milky Way, small regions
that contained no stars but
that were surrounded on all
sides by countless numbers
of them. Herschel thought
they were holes, which hap-
pened to be pointed in our
direction so that we could
see through into a cylinder
of starlessness.

Galaxy

Herschel reported in 1785
on his attempt to deter-
mine the shape of the con-
glomeration of stars of
which we were part. To
count all the stars all over
the sky was, of course, im-
practical. He therefore took
samples. He chose 683 re-
gions, well scattered, and
counted the stars he could
see in each one. (This was
the first application of sta-
tistical methods to astron-
omy.)

He found that the num-
ber of stars per unit area of
sky rose steadily as one ap-
proached the Milky Way,
was maximal in the plane
of the Milky Way, and mini-
mal in the direction at
right angles to that plane.
This, he thought, would be
explained if the star system
were lens-shaped, with the
Milky Way marking out the
long diameter of the lens
all around.

Such a lens-shaped star
collection had been sup-
posed by earlier astrono-
mers, but Herschel had
now made it a matter of
close observation. For the
first time, the Galaxy truly
took shape, although even
then no astronomer had a

conception of its true size
or of the vast number of
stars it contained. Herschel
thought it contained a hun-
dred million stars—an
enormous underestimate.,

Uniformitar-

o
ianism
Buffon’s attempt to esti-
mate the age of the Earth
(see 1749) had been strictly
speculative. Another at-
tempt was now made by a
British geologist, James
Hutton (1726—1797), who
wished to base it on actual
observation. He spent vears
studying the rocks of every
part of Great Britain care-
fully.

It seemed to him, as a
result of his studies, that
there had been an exceed-
ingly slow evolution of the
Earth's structure. Some
rocks had been laid down
as sediment and slowly
compressed; some had
emerged as lava and then
been slowly worn down by
wind and water.

The great point he
made was that these
changes were taking place
very slowly and had been
doing so in the past. There-
fore, by measuring the rate

 
of change and noting how
much had been accom-
plished at that slow rate,
one could get a notion of
how long the change as a
whole had taken. This be-
lief is called uniformitarian-
ism (change at a uniform
rate over the eons), and it
was opposed to the opinion

that the Earth had been af-
fected by sudden catastro-
phes such as Noah's Flood
(catastrophism) in which
huge changes could take
place in comparatively lit-
tle time.

Hutton published his
observations and conclu-
sions in Theory of the Earth,

which was published in
1785. He did not attempt to
estimate the age of the
Earth, but he made it clear
that the Earth had to be ex-
tremely old, and that there
was no trace of when its be-
ginning might have been
from what he could ob-
serve.

 

1786

 

Mountain-
Climbing
Mountains are impressive,
and because they reach to-
ward the sky and their tops
are not attainable by
human beings without a
great deal of trouble, they
were often assumed to be
the abode of gods. The con-
nection of Mt. Olympus
with the Greek gods and of
Mt. Sinai with the God of
the Bible are examples.
Generally, human be-

 

ings admired mountains
but avoided them. If it was
absolutely necessary to get
to the other side, they
searched for comparatively
accessible “passes.” Some
climbing had been done for
scientific purposes, how-
ever. Thus, the Swiss natu-
ralist Conrad Gesner
(1516~1565) had climbed
mountain peaks in the Alps
to search out alpine species
of plants.

By the 1700s, however,
scientists had grown in-
creasingly interested in

mountains—in the plants
and animals living there, in
the nature of the rocks, and
in the glaciers that frosted
their peaks. The Alps were
the mountains most avail-
able to west-European sci-
entists, and their highest
peak is Mount Blanc
(French for “white,” be-
cause its peak is white with
snow and ice at all times).
It is 15,700 feet high. No
one had climbed it, of
course, and it was univer-
sally regarded as the act of
a lunatic to try.
 

However, a prize was
offered for the first person
who could accomplish the
feat, and in 1786 a French
doctor, Michel-Gabriel Pac-
card (1757-1827), along
with a porter, Jacques Bal-
mat, won the prize.

As often happens once
one person accomplishes a
feat previously considered
impossible, others at once
find out they can duplicate
it. Paccard’s climb initiated
a virtual frenzy of moun-
tain-climbing (among

British aristocrats particu-
larly). Sometimes this was
for scientific purposes, but
often it was merely for the
excitement and adventure
of it, as was the case with
ballooning.

 

1787

 

Charles’s Law

Amontons had discovered
the relationship between
the volume of gas and its
temperature (see 1699). For
some reason, the discovery
was neglected. Charles (see
1783) rediscovered the rela-
tionship in 1787, however,
and the French chemist
Joseph-Louis Gay-Lussac
(1778-1850) again rediscov-
ered it five years later. The
relationship is sometimes
called Charles’s law and
sometimes, Gay-Lussac’s
law. Amontons remains for-
gotten.

The amount by which a
gas shrank as the tempera-

ture decreased by 1 degree
Celsius was '73 of its vol-
ume at 0 degrees. If the law
held for all temperatures, a
gas must shrink to zero vol-
ume at —273° C, which
would be an absolute zero.
This would be true, how-
ever, only if gases remained
gases as the temperature
decreased, and whether
this was so or not was not
known.

Chemical
Nomenclature

Language often stands in
the way of scientific ad-
vance. This was especially

true in chemistry, since
chemists had inherited
from the alchemists a be-
wildering array of names
for various substances. The
alchemists had deliberately
attempted to in e their
reputations by speaking
metaphorically and mysti-
cally, and since no two
used the same metaphors,
chemists could scarcely un-
derstand each other when
they reported their work.
Through the 1700s, at-
tempts had been made to
systematize the use of
chemical terms and names
for substances. Finally in
1787 Lavoisier (see 1769)
and several coworkers pub

 

 
lished The Method of Chenti-
cal Nomenclature, in which
a sensible and logical sys-
tem was proposed. This
was accepted by chemists
over the next couple of de-
cades, and finally chemis-
try had one language,
which it retains to this day.

 

 

 

   

Steamboat

Until this time, steam en-
gines had been used only to
power pumps and textile

1788

machinery. Yet if a steam
engine could turn a paddle
wheel, it could also serve as
a mechanical oar of great
power, which could drive a
ship through water against
both wind and current
without the expenditure of
human muscle (except that
of feeding fuel to the engine
so that steam could be gen-
erated),

The first person to
achieve a workable steam-
boat was the American in-

  

ventor John Fitch (1743~
1798). On August 22, 1787,
his first steamboat navi-
gated the Delaware River
for the first time. For a
while Fitch kept up a regu-
lar schedule of trips from
Philadelphia to Trenton
and back. However, there
were few passengers, the
ship operated at a loss, the
financial backers quit, and
the ship was finally de-
stroyed in a storm in 1792.

 

 

Algebra and
Mechanics

Geometry seemed a natural
way of describing mechan-

ics, but Descartes (see 1637)
had shown that algebra

could deal with geometric
problems.

A French mathemati-
cian, Joseph-Louis La-
grange (1736-1813),
tackled the study of me-
chanics in a totally nongeo-
metric way. Using algebra

and calculus, he worked
out very general equations
by means of which mechan-
ical problems could be
solved.

He summarized his
work in Analytical Mechan-
ics, published in 1788 by a
very reluctant publisher. (A
friend of Lagrange had to
guarantee his purchase of
any unsold copies.) It
turned out to be a classic of
science, although (as La-
grange boasted) there was
not one geometric diagram
in it. Geometry remains im-
portant, but Lagrange
helped free the world of sci-
ence from its unnecessary
tyranny.

Affinities

Chemists up to this time
had to take chemical reac-
tions as they found them.
Substance A would react

1789

with substance B but not
with substance C and that
was all there was to it.

The Swedish mineralo-
gist Torbern Olof Berg-
mann (1735—1784) had
struggled to classify miner-
als and to make sense out
of chemical reactions. He
listed affinities—that is, the
extent to which different
chemicals interacted. He
also prepared tables that
made some sense out of the
matter and helped predict
whether certain reactions,
not yet observed, would
take place or not if given a
chance.

His results were pub-

 

 

lished posthumously in
1788, and while they repre-
sented the barest beginning
in the study of chemical be-
havior, they were a begin-
ning.

 

 

Satellites

By the end of the 1600s, ten
satellites were known:
Earth’s moon, the four sat-
ellites of Jupiter discovered
by Galileo (see 1610), and

the five satellites of Saturn
discovered by Huygens (see
1656) and Cassini (see
1665).

A century had passed
after Cassini’s discovery of
Dione in 1684 without any

 

further satellite discoveries.
Then in 1787, Herschel dis-
covered two satellites of his
own planet, Uranus (see
1781). He named them Tita-
nia and Oberon, after the
queen and king of the fair-
ies in William Shake-
speare’s A Midsummer
Night's Dream, thus break-
ing with the traditional use
of the classical myths.

In 1789 Herschel dis-
covered two more satellites
of Saturn, which were
nearer the planet than the
others were. He named
them Mimas and Encela-
dus, after two giants who
had rebelled against Zeus
(Jupiter) in the Greek
myths. Fourteen satellites
were now known: Earth
had one, Jupiter four, Sa-
turn seven, and Uranus
two. No more were to be
discovered for half a cen-
tury.

Acids

Lavoisier (see 1774) had
named the active portion of
the atmosphere oxygen
(acid-producer) because it
was thought that all acids
contained oxygen.

In 1789, however, the
French chemist Claude-
Louis Berthollet (1748—

1822) showed that hydrocy-
anic acid and hydrosulfuric
acid did not contain oxy-
gen. To be sure, they are
very weak acids, but it was
eventually shown that hy-
drochleric acid, a strong
acid, also did not contain
oxygen.

Conservation of
Mass

Lavoisier in 1789 wrote the
best textbook of chemistry
the world had seen up to
that time.

The most important
generalization he intro-
duced in that book was that
in any closed system (one
from which no mass was al-
lowed to leave, and into
which no mass was allowed
to enter), the total amount
of mass remained the same
no matter what physical or
chemical changes went on.
This is the law of conserva-
tion of mass. For over a cen-
tury it has been central to
chemistry, and when it was

finally modified, it was only
to make it even more funda-
mental.

Uranium

In 1789 Klaproth (see
1784), who was working
with a heavy black ore
called pitchblende, obtained
a yellow compound that
contained a hitherto un-
known element. He thought
it was the element itself,
and he named it after a
planet, after the fashion of
the medieval alchemists.
Since the planet Uranus
had been discovered only
eight years before, Klap-
roth named his new ele-
ment uranium. Neither he
nor anyone else could possi-
bly have foretold the sig-
nificance it would come to
have in the future.

In that same year, Klap-
roth also obtained a new
oxide from the semipre-
cious jewel zircon and
named the new metal con-
tained in the oxide zirco-
nium.

 
 

1790

 

Industrial
Revolution

Great Britain's economic
position was improving
enormously with its inge-
nious new textile machin-
ery and the manner of
powering it by steam. It
was easy for the British
leaders to see that if they
could retain a monopoly on
this Industrial Revolution,
Britain might easily be-
come the strongest power
in the world—economi-
cally, at any rate.

For this reason, what
we would today call an
“iron curtain”’ was
clamped down. Blueprints
of the new machinery were
not allowed to leave the
country, and neither were
engineers who were experts
in the new technology.

The new nation of the
United States wanted the
new technology to aid in its
economic independence

 

 

 

from Great Britain, without
which its political indepen-
dence wouldn't amount to
much. It therefore did its
best to steal the knowledge
by encouraging defectors. It
found its man in Samuel
Slater (1768-1835).

Slater was an engineer
who knew the new technol-
ogy intimately, but who
also knew that he could ad-
vance only so far in the
class-ridden society of
Great Britain. The United
States was offering money
for his knowledge and he
decided to go for it. He
couldn't take any blue-
prints with him, of course,
so he painstakingly went
about memorizing every de-
tail of the machinery. He
then disguised himself as a

arm laborer and sneaked

out of the country. In 1789
he arrived in the United
States and made contact
with rich merchants in
Rhode Island.

In 1790, working from

 

memory, Slater began
building the first American
factory based on the new
machinery, in Pawtucket,
Rhode Island.

In this way, the Indus-
trial Revolution came to
the United States, and once
the process of proliferation
began there was no stop-
ping it. It continues to this
day. Of course, when other
nations try to make use of
our technology in the same
way that we made use of
Great Britain's, we are,
very naturally, indignant.

 

 

Metric System

Throughout history, every
nation, sometimes every re-
gion within a nation, has
developed its own system
of measurements. As long
as trade was slow and com-
munication was limited,
that was merely an annoy-

 

ance. However, as the eco-
nomic interdependence of
pidly in

 

Europe increased ra
modern times, the absolute
jungle of different measure-
ments was a serious handi-
cap to progress and
prosperity. Yet tradition
made it almost impossible
for any region to give up its
time-sanctified system for
others merely because the
others made more sense
and were easier to use.

The French, however,
in the grip of their Revolu-
tion, thought it a suitable
time to develop a system of
sensible measurements,
and they appointed a com-
mission to work on it, a
commission including such
men as Laplace (see 1783),
Lagrange (see 1788), and
Lavoisier (see 1769).

The commission tried

 

to base the system on natu-
ral measurements, so that
the basic unit of length, for
instance, the meter (from a
Greek word meaning “to
measure”’), was to be equal
in length to 1/10,000,000 of
the distance from the North
Pole to the Equator. Other
units were worked out to in-
terconnect with the meter,
when that was possible,
while larger and smaller
units were worked out by
multiplying or dividing by
ten.

This so-called metric
svstent was by far the most
useful and logical system of
measurement ever dreamed
up, and all that stood in the
way of its instant adeption
was, first, the dead weight

of tradition, and second,
the hostility of the rest of
Europe to the French Revo-
lutionaries. Even so, it grad-
ually spread, and today the
metric system is used uni-
versally, except in the
United States. And even in
the United States, the met-
ric system is used by scien-
tists, and increasingly by
others.

The metric system rep-
resented an improvement
in technique, and like other
such techniques (writing,
the alphabet, Arabic numer-
als, printing, chemical no-
menclature), it may not
have advanced scientific
knowledge in itself, but it
made such advances easier.

 

1791

 

Titanium

The English minister Wil-
liam Gregor (1761-1817)
grew interested in mineral-
ogy. More out of curiosity
than anything else, he took
to analyzing as many odd

minerals as he could find.
In 1791 he isolated a sub-
stance from one of these
minerals that he felt might
be a new element. It was,
and four years later it was
named titanium by Klap-
roth (see 1784).

Columbia River

The American navigator
Robert Gray (1755-1806),
between 1787 and 1790,
was the first American to
circumnavigate the world,
doing so during a voyage to
obtain furs on the north Pa-
cific coast and exchange
them for tea in China. In
1791 he returned to the
Northwest in the ship Co-

1793

lumbia. On May 12 of that
year he discovered a river
which he named Columbia
for his ship, then circum-
navigated the globe a sec-

ond time. The United
States used this trip as the
basis for its eventual claim
to the Oregon Territory.

 

 

Cotton Gin

The new textile industry of
Great Britain, and the one
that was just beginning to
arise in New England,
meant increasing demands
for cotton, which could be
grown with great profusion
in the southern states. How-
ever, it was difficult to pull
the cotton threads off the
seeds in the cotton bolls,
and that limited the quan-
tity that could be produced.
In April 1793, however,
an American inventor, Eli
Whitney (1765—1825), chal-
lenged to do something

about the problem, in-
vented the cotton gin (gin is
short for engine). It was a
simple device in which
metal wires poked through
slats and entangled them-
selves in the cotton fibers.
The wires were affixed to a
wheel, and as the wheel
turned, the cotton fibers
were pulled off. One gin
could produce 50 pounds of
cleaned cotton per day.
The effect on the
United States was cata-
strophic. The southern
states began to produce cot-
ton in great quantities, and
slaves were needed, also in

great quantity, to pull the
bolls off the plants so that
the gins would have enough
to work on.

The southern states,
which had been giving up
on slavery, had to return to
it now, defend it, and work
up all sorts of ex
its existence. Theyv devel-
oped an agricultural econ-
omy based on slave labor,
which kept them poor,
while the northern states
grew rich on wheat and in
dustry. And in the e

Insane Asylums

In ancient times, people
who were insane were
thought to be touched by
some sort of divine influ-
ence and were treated, on
occasion, with awe and re-
spect. However, in Chris-
tian Europe (influenced by
tales of demonic possession
in the New Testament),
they were thought to be in-
fested by devils and were
sometimes mistreated phys-
ically in order to force
those devils to leave. The in-
sane were also treated as
figures of fun, and insane
asylums were thought to be
amusing places to visit,
though they were dreadful
nightmares of howling, de-
mented people, imprisoned
and often subjected to the
most brutal treatment.

A French physician,
Philippe Pinel (1745-1826),
thought that psychotics
were sick in mind and de-
served as considerate treat-
ment as those who were
sick in body. In 1791 he
published his views on men-
tal alienation; that is, on

 

 

minds alienated from their
proper function. (For a
while, physicians who spe-
cialized in mental disorders
were called alienists, be-
cause of this.)

The French Revolution-
aries, always ready to
break with established cus-
tom, put Pinel in charge of
an insane asylum in 1793,
and there he struck off the
chains of the inmates and
began to make systematic
studies of their conditions.
He was the first to keep
well-documented case his-
tories of mental ailments.

It took half a century,
though, for this civilized
view of mental illness to
penetrate the rest of Eu-
rope (and the United
States).

 

 

Across North
America

A British-born Canadian ex-
plorer, Alexander Macken-
zie (1764—1820), worked his
way into the interior of Can-
ada, settling in what is now
the Province of Alberta.

From there he followed
what is now called the Mac-
kenzie River to its mouth in
the Arctic Ocean, which he
reached in 1789. In 1793 he
crossed the Rocky Moun-
tains to the Pacific Ocean in
what is now British Colum-
bia.

He was the first person
to visit the Atlantic, Pacific,
and Arctic shores—all
three—of North America.

Vancouver
Island

The British navigator
George Vancouver (1757—
1798), who had sailed with
Captain Cook (see 1768),
continued to explore the
lands Cook had examined—
Australia, New Zealand, Ta-
hiti, and Hawaii.

He also explored the
Pacific Northwest coast of
the United States and, in
1793, circumnavigated an
island of moderate size off
the coast of what is now
British Columbia. It is
called Vancouver Island in
his honor.

 
 

1794

 

Meteorites

It was the common experi-
ence of human beings that
objects sometimes fell from
the sky. Such falls had been
reported. The Kaaba, the
sacred black stone of the
Muslims, was probably a
meteorite that fell from the
sky. In Ephesus, a stone
was worshipped in the tem-
} ple of Artemis that was
probably a meteorite, and
periodically reports of wit-
nessed falls were received.

During the Age of Rea-
son, such tales were dis-
counted and dismissed by
men of science.

In 1794, however, a
German physicist, Ernst

 

Florens Friedrich Chladni
(1756—1827), published a
book in which he suggested
that meteorites did fall and
that this happened because
the space near Earth con-
tained the debris of a
planet that had once ex-
isted but had exploded.

This was the first time
that a reasonable explana-
tion had been offered for
meteorites, and the tide
slowly began to turn. It
took a while, though.

Rare Earths

The term earth at this time
was applied to any oxide
that was insoluble in water

and resistant to the action
of heat. The Earth's crust
was largely a mixture of
these oxides, hence the
name. Examples of com-
mon earths are calcium
oxide, magnesium oxide,
iron oxide, and silicon diox-
ide.

A Finnish chemist,
Johan Gadolin (1760—
1852), studied a strange
mineral that had been ob-
tained from a quarry in
Ytterby (near Stockholm).
Gadolin recognized it as a
new earth unlike any pre-
viously known. He called it
a rare earth to distinguish it
from the common ones.
From this rare earth and
from others like it, a num

 
ber of metallic elements

(the rare earth elements)
were eventually located, all

1795

remarkably similar in
chemical properties.

 

Canning Food

The trouble with food is
that much of it doesn’t
keep. Fairly quickly, it rots,
sours, grows moldy. To pre-
serve food for periods of
time so that people don't
starve over the winter, use
must be made of drying,
salting, smoking, and so on.
A diet that depends on such
foods preserves life but is
monotonous.

The rising French mili-

tary leader Napoléon Bona-
parte (1769—1821) realized
the importance of decent
food to an army that had
all Europe arrayed against
it and offered a prize of
twelve thousand francs for
some way of preserving
fresh food for a long period
of time.

In 1795 a French inven-
tor, Nicolas-Francois Ap-
pert (1750-1841), began
working on the problem.
He knew that Spallanzani

(see 1768) had shown that
meat would not rot if it was
boiled for a long enough pe-
riod and then sealed. Ap-
pert therefore worked out a
system for applying this
principle on a large scale,
heating meats and vegeta-
bles and sealing them into
glass or metal containers.

It took some years to
perfect the process, but Ap-
pert's system represented
the beginning of the canned
food industry.

 
 

1796

 

 

Vaccination

Inoculation had been used
to fight smallpox for some
eighty years (see 1713), but
it was dangerous.

The English physician
Edward Jenner (1749-
1823) knew that in his na-
tive Gloucestershire there
were tales to the effect that
anyone who caught cowpox
(a very mild disease, preva-
lent among cows, that
somewhat resembled small-
pox) was thereafter im-
mune not only to cowpox
but also to smallpox. (Since
milkmaids almost invari-
ably caught cowpox early
and then never got small-
pox, they retained a clear
complexion. This in itself
may have been enough to
fuel the romantic cliché of
the time concerning pretty
milkmaids.)

Finally Jenner decided
to test the matter. On May
14, 1796, he found a milk-
maid who was undergoing
an attack of cowpox. He
took the fluid from a blister
on her hand and injected it
into an eight-year-old boy

named James Phipps who,
of course, got cowpox. Two
months later, Jenner inocu-
lated the boy with small-
pox in the manner usual for
those days. The boy did not
get smallpox. Two years
later, he found someone
else with active cowpox
and tried again. It worked
this time also, and he felt it
safe to announce his discov-
ery.

The Latin word for cow
is vacea, so C()\\'pox lS vac-
cinia. Jenner coined the
word vaccination to de-
scribe his use of cowpox in-
oculation to create
immunity to smallpox. In
this way, he founded the sci-
ence of immunology.

Such was the dread of
smallpox that the new
technique was instantly
adopted and quickly spread
all over Europe. It was the
first case of a serious and
frightening disease that
could be reliably pre-
vented.

Nebular
Hypothesis

Kant's suggestion (see
1755) that the Solar System
had formed from the con-
densation of a vast nebula
of dust and gas had gone
mostly unnoticed.

In 1796, however,
Laplace (see 1783) had
published a popular
nonmathematical book on
astronomy and, in the ap-
pendix, had made a similar
suggestion, describing it in
much greater detail. As the
condensing cloud spun
faster and faster, he ex-
plained, first one ring of
gas, then another and an-
other were given off. The
rings condensed to form the
planet, The planets, in con-
densing, gave off smaller
rings that formed the satel-
lites.

Laplace felt that cer-
tain nebulas visible in
space were themselves con-
tracting and represented
planetary systems in the
process of formation. His
suggestion was therefore
it

called the nebular hypothe-
sis. It proved very popular
with astronomers for a
time.

Heptadecagon

Though Greek astronomy,
physics, chemistry, medi-
cine, and geography had all
been replaced since the be-
ginning of the Scientific
Revolution, Greek geome-
try had remained staunch
and firm.

In 1796, however, a
young German mathemati-

  

1797

 

 

cian, Carl Friedrich Gauss
(1777-1855), worked out a
method for constructing a
heptadecagon (a polygon
built up of seventeen sides
of equal lengths and some-
times called a seventeen-
gon in consequence), using
a compass and straightedge
only. The Greeks had
missed that construction,
and Gauss's feat was con-
sidered the first notable ad-
dition to geometry since
ancient times.

But Gauss did more
than simply find a method

of construction. He showed
that only polygons of cer-
tain numbers of sides could
be constructed with com-
pass and straightedge
alone. An equilateral hepta-
gon (a polygon with seven
equal sides) could not be
constructed in this fashion.
This was the first case of a
geomietric construction
being proved impossible.
From this point on, the
proof of impossibility in
mathematics grew increas-
ingly important.

 

Chromium

A French chemist, Louis-
Nicolas Vauquelin (1763—
1829), had prudently left
France during the Terror

but had returned after
Robespierre’s execution
(see 1794). In 1797 he was
working with a mineral
from Siberia and isolated
from it a new metal, which

he named chromium from
the Greek word for “color,”
because of the many colors
of its compounds.

 
Parachute

The principle of the para-
chute (a light object that
presents a large surface to
the air so that air resistance
slows its descent) was sim-

ple enough. The French
balloonist Jean-Pierre-
Francois Blanchard (1753—
1809) used one in 1785 to
drop a dog in a basket
safely to Earth from a bal-
loon. The first case of a

 

human being
chute successfully came in
1797 when another |
balloonist, Andr¢
Garnerin (1769—182:
managed it

using a para-

Mass of the
Earth

Newton's equation for the
gravitational attraction of
one body to another (see
1687) contained symbols
for the gravitational con-
stant, the masses of the two
bodies, the distance be-
tween them, and the accel-
eration of movement
toward each other.

In the case of an object
falling to Earth, the mass of
the object, its distance from
Earth’s center, and its ac-
celeration were all known.

That left two unknowns,
the mass of the Earth and
the gravitational constant.
If one of these could

be determined, the other
could be calculated at
once.

The gravitational con-
stant was the same for all
objects. If the gravitational
attraction between two ob-
jects, each of known mass,
at a known distance from
each other, could be mea-
sured, that would allow the
gi'a\ilaliunzsl constant to be
calculated and, from that,
the mass of the Earth. How-
ever, two objects of known

mass were sure to be so
small that the gravitational
attraction between them
would be very tiny.
Nevertheless, Caven-
dish (see 1766) tried it in
1798. He suspended a light
rod by a wire attached to
its center. At each end of
the rod was a light lead
ball. The rod could twist
freely about the wire, and

 

 

 

even a small force applied
to the balls in opposite di-
rections would produce a
measurable twist. Caven-

 
 

dish measured h
twist was produced

ous small forces

 
 

 

He then brought two
large balls near the two
light balls, one on either
side. The force of gravity be-
tween the large balls and
light balls twisted the wire.
Cavendish measured the
twist and from that calcu-
lated the gravitational
force between the two ob-
jects, That gave him the
gravitational constant,
and that in turn gave him
the mass of the Earth.

The Earth turned out

to have a mass of
6,600,000,000,000,000,000,000
tons. Based on the known
volume of the Earth, this
made the average density
of the Earth five and a half
times that of water.

So precise was Caven-
dish’s experiment that this
first-time calculation was
very close to the value ac-
cepted today.

Comparative
Anatomy

The greatest anatomist of
his day was a Frenchman,
Georges Cuvier (1769—
1832). In a book published
in 1798, he studied the anat-
omy of various animals to
show how they compared
with one another and did
so with such excellence
that he is considered the
founder of comparative
anatomy.

 

He introduced a new
broad classification into the
taxonomic scheme of Lin-
naeus (see 1735). Lin-
naeus’s broadest division
was that of class, but Cu-
vier grouped various
classes into phyla (singular
phylum, from a Greek word
for “tribe").

Cuvier's eye for detail
was such that he could tell
whether fossil remains rep-
resented animals that be-
longed to one or another of
the known phyla even
though they were not mem-
bers of any living species.

Everything he discov-
ered seemed to imply the
existence of biological evo-
lution, but Cuvier remained
frmly in the antievolution
camp.

Population
Pressure

It seems obvious that popu-
lation increases in times of
peace, health, and prosper-
ity and declines as a result
of war, disease, and famine,
but the first to try to ana-
lyze the matter dispassion-
ately was a British
economist, Thomas Robert
Malthus (1766—1834). In
1798 he published a book,
Essay on Population, in
which he pointed out that
population tended to in-
crease in geometric progres-

sion (2,4, 8, 16 .. ) while
the food supply tended to
increase in arithmetic pro-
gression (2,3,4,5...).As
a result, population would
always outstrip the food
supply no matter what
happened, and the surplus
number of people would
have to be stripped away
by famine, war, and dis-
ease.

This imparted a certain
inevitability to disaster and
misery, which could only
be removed by lowering the
birthrate. In a second edi-
tion, Malthus suggested de-
layed marriage and sexual
continence as a way of
bringing this about. It
doesn’t take much of a
cynic to realize that in the
long run this won't work,
but any suggestion that
there are ways of lowering
the birthrate without de-
priving people of the plea-
sures of sex is always met
with strong disapproval
on the part of the blue-
nosed.

Malthus did not grasp
the role technological ad-
vance could play in ward-
ing off disaster, even
though he wrote at a time
when the Industrial Revolu-
tion was in its early stages.
Because of such advances,
the world population is
now five times what it was
in Malthus's day and the
Malthusian consequence
has not yet been paid. But
technological advance only
delays, it does not stop, and
the longer the delay, the
more terrific the crash. Un-
less, of course, we lower the
birthrate.

Liquid
Ammonia

Water with substances dis-
solved in it melts at a lower
temperature than pure
water does. The French
chemist Louis-Bernard
Guyton de Morveau (1737-
1816), by adding calcium
chloride to an ice and water
mixture, brought about a
temperature drop to —44°
C. He used this low temper-
ature to liquefy the gas am-
monia, which becomes
liquid at a temperature of
=332,

This was the first time
a substance until then
known only as a gas was
chilled to liquid form.

Interchangeable
Parts

In 1798 Eli Whitney, who
had invented the cotton gin
(see 1793), was awarded a
contract to manufacture
ten thousand muskets for
the American government.
Up to that time, every
musket (and indeed every
device consisting of more
than one part) had been
made with each part ad-
justed to fit the adjoining
part. If a part was broken, a
new one had to be adjusted
manually, A corresponding
part from a similar device
would not necessarily (and,
in fact, would virtually
never) replace the broken
part without adjustment.
Whitney, however, ma-
chined his parts with such
precision that a particular
part could replace any
other one of that part. The
story is that when the mus-

kets were done he brought
some of them, disassem-
bled, and placed them at
the feet of a government of-
ficial. Then, picking out
parts at random, he put to-
gether a working musket.

The development of
methods for producing in-
terchangeable parts was an
important part of the devel-
oping Industrial Revolu-
tion.

Beryllium

In 1798 Vauquelin, who
had discovered chromium
(see 1797), recognized the
existence of a new element
in the gems beryl and emer-
ald. He named the element
beryllium.

Law of Definite
Proportions

The French chemist Joseph-
Louis Proust (1754—1826)
was working in Spain at
this time in order to escape
the turmoil of the French
Revolution and took part in
a heated controversy over
whether the composition of
substances varied with the
manner of manufacture.

Using painstakingly
careful analysis, Proust
showed in 1799 that copper
carbonate contained defi-
nite proportions, by weight,
of copper, carbon, and oxy-
gen, no matter how it was
prepared in the laboratory
or how it was isolated from
nature. The preparation
was always five parts of
copper to four of oxygen to
one of carbon.

He went on to make a
similar case for a number
of other compounds and
maintained that there was
a general law of definite pro-
portions, often called
Proust’s law.

In this way, Proust
could distinguish between
mixtures (in which differ-
ent elements could exist in
any proportions, as in air)
and compounds (in which

different elements mixed in
definite proportions and no
other).

Strata

Many observers had noted
that rocks existed in layers,
or strata (the Latin word for
“layers”). An English geolo-
gist, William Smith (1769—
1839), who was engaged in
working on canals, had fre-
quent opportunities to see
the strata at excavation
sites.

He became interested
in strata to the exclusion of
all else and, in 1799, began
writing on the subject.
Smith made a new point.
Each stratum had its own
characteristic forms of fos-
sils, not found in other
strata. No matter how the
strata were bent and crum-
pled—even when one sank
out of view and cropped up
again miles away—its fos-
sils went with it. In fact, it
seemed to Smith, one could
identify a stratum from its
fossil content.

Since it could be rea-
sonably supposed that a
stratum nearer the surface
was younger than one
deeper down, the strata of-
fered a method for working
out an orderly history of

life from the fossils and
even coming to some rough
conclusions as to how long
ago different fossils had ex-
isted as living forms.

Perturbations

In 1799 Laplace (see 1783)
published the first volume
of a monumental five-vol-
ume work called Celestial
Mechanics, in which the
gravitational influences on
the various bodies of the
Solar System were taken
up in detail. Although the
Sun dominates the system,
and the planets move about
the Sun in stately ellipses,
each planet pulls at the oth-
ers, and so do the satellites.

These small additional
pulls introduce minor vari-
ations in the movement of
the planetary bodies, called
perturbations, and it was
considered that they might
gradually increase in size
over time so that the Solar
System would prove unsta-
ble in the long run.

Laplace showed that
this was not the case. The
perturbations are periodic
and vary on either side of
what would exist if the Sun
alone had a gravitational
pull. The Solar System,
then, is stable.

 
Rosetta Stone

While Bonaparte’s army
was in Egypt, a French sol-
dier came across a black
stone near a town that Eu-
ropeans called Rosetta.
What he found was there-
fore called the Rosetta
Stone.

On the Rosetta Stone
was an inscription in Greek
dating back to 197 B.c. It

wasn't an interesting in-
scription in itself, but pres-
ent also were inscriptions
in two different forms of
Egyptian writing. If, as
seemed likely, this was the
same inscription in three
different languages, then
one had an inscription in

two forms of Egyptian writ-

ing, which at that time no
one could read, and a
Greek inscription that

many scholars could
read.

In the next few de-
cades, the Rosetta Stone
was studied in order to
learn the Egyptian lan-
guages, so that from in-
scriptions and writings left
behind by the Egyptians,
vast stretches of Egyptian
history might come to be
understood.

Electric Battery

Galvani, noting that dead
muscle twitched when
touched simultaneously by
two different metals, had
decided that electricity was
involved and that it origi-
nated in the muscle (see
1780). The Italian physicist

 

Alessandro Giuseppe Volta
(1745-1827) thought the
electricity originated in the
metals.

He began to experi-
ment with different metals
in contact and was soon
convinced that he was cor-
rect. In 1800 Volta con-
structed devices that would

produce electricity continu-
ously if it was drawn off as
produced. This created an
electric eurrent, which
turned out to be far more
useful than the nonflowing
electric charge of static
electricity

At first Volta used
bowls of salt solution to

  

 
 

produce the flow. The
bowls were connected by
means of arcs of metal dip-
ping from one bowl to the
next, one end of the arc
being copper and the other
being tin or zinc. Since any
group of similar objects
working as a unit may be
called a batiery, Volta's de-
vice was an electric battery
—the first in history.

Volta then made mat-
ters more compact and less
watery by using small
round plates of copper and
zinc, plus disks of card-
board moistened in salt so-
lution. Starting with
copper at the bottom, the
disks, reading upward,
were copper, zine, card-
board, copper, zinc, card-
board, and so on. If a wire
was attached to the top and
bottom of this battery, an

electric current would flow
when the circuit was
closed.

Decomposition
of Water

The existence of Volta’s
electric battery (see above)
was publicized on March
20, 1800. Within seven
weeks, it was put to work.

On May 2, an English chem-

ist, William Nicholson

(1753—1815), built a battery

of his own and passed an
electric current through
slightly acidified water.
Bubbles of hydrogen
and oxygen were produced
in the water. The water had
been electrolyzed and bro-
ken up into the hydrogen
and oxygen that had been
combined in its formation.
Volta had shown that a
chemical reaction taking
place between copper and
zinc in salt water could
form an electric current,
while Nicholson had shown
that the reverse was also
true, that an electric cur-

rent could produce a chemi-

cal reaction.

Later that year, the
German physicist Johann
Wilhelm Ritter (1776—
1810) allowed the gases
formed in electrolyzing
water to arise from two
wires and bubble into sepa-
rate containers. In one con-

tainer, hydrogen was col-
lected, and in the other, ox-
ygen. The volume of
hydrogen was just twice
the volume of the oxygen.
Ritter also passed a
current through a solution
of copper sulfate, and cop-
per appeared on the nega-
tive electrode. (This was
one of the two metal rods
sticking into the solution,
the other being the positive
electrode.) This was the be-
ginning of electro-plating.

Infrared
Radiation

It seemed natural to sup-
pose that light, by its very
nature, could be seen; light
that could not be seen
would be a contradiction in
terms. Yet invisible light ex-
isted.

Herschel (see 1781) in
1800 had formed a sunlight
spectrum and tested differ-
ent parts of it with a ther-
mometer to see if some
colors delivered more heat
than others. He found that
the temperature rose as he
moved toward the red end
of the spectrum, and it
seemed sensible to move
the thermometer just past
the red end in order to
watch the heating effect dis-
appear.

Except that it didn’t.
The temperature rose
