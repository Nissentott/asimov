us in all but a few details of
the skull that they were fi-
nally recognized as being of
our species. And why not?
There is evidence that they
may have interbred with
human beings of the pres-
ent type. They are now re-
ferred to as Homo sapiens
neanderthalensis and are
considered one of the two
known subspecies of Homo
sapiens. We moderns are
the other.

The Neanderthals lived
from 200,000 B.c. to 30,000

B.C. in Africa and Eurasia.
They lived during glacial
times and hunted the mam-
moth, the woolly rhinoc-
eros, and the giant cave
bear. Their stone tools were
greater in variety and more
delicate and precise than
had ever been seen before.
They definitely knew how
to start fires.

They were the first
hominids to bury their
dead. Earlier hominids, like
animals generally, simply
left their dead lying where
they had fallen so that they

were scavenged by preda-
tors and what was left over
rotted. The fact that Nean-
derthals buried their dead,
thus preserving them from
scavengers, if not from
decay bacteria, tends to
show that they valued life
somchow, felt affection,
and ecared for individuals.
Sometimes the dead were
old and crippled and could
only have lived as long as
they did with the loving
help of others of the tribe.

What's more, food and
flowers were often buried
with the corpse, and this
seems to indicate that Ne-
anderthals felt life contin-
ued on an individual basis
after death. If they felt that
there was life after death,
then this might indicate the
first stirrings of what we
can call religionâ€”a [eeling
that there is more to the
Universe than is apparent
to the senses.
