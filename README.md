This is the source code to a Visual Chronology of Science & Discovery. Here is a
[demo of the visualization][demo], and [more information about why it
exists][blog].

So far, the visualization covers the period up to 1700 CE according to
[Asimov][book]. The next step in the project is to summarize the contents of the
book from 1700 CE onward.

- If there's an issue with the visualization you'd like addressed, please submit
  a [GH issue][issue].
- If there's an error in the text, please edit the [corresponding entry in the
  spreadsheet][spreadsheet-old].
- If you'd like to contribute new entries, please [add them to the
  spreadsheet][spreadsheet-new].
